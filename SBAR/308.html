I'll manage the business well. Please come back. Just this once, I beg you to forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula shook her head with feigned disappointment. "Jeff, every day is valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lying here for a day can cost you several projects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And don't aim too high too quickly. You need to take steady steps. Now that Queenie has Jace's support, your business will benefit, too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I also heard that Jace gave Frank a few projects today. You should meet Jace tomorrow. He might hand you a few deals too, solving the company's crisis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula finished her words with a meaningful tone before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Go ahead, drain the Foliot family dry. Their attention will be elsewhere for a few days, giving her the opportunity to secretly manipulate many things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luckily, she had remained active in business over the years; otherwise, the company would have already fallen into Queenie's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were quite a few people inside loyal to Queenie and Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had prepared in advance. Queenie and Jeff would be the only ones to fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People have to swallow some grievances, but that doesn't mean they should stop moving forward. One day, she would show them how terrifying the consequences of deceiving her could be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of Paula's suggestion, Jeff didn't get up to chase after her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next morning, Jeff went to visit Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before leaving, he told Queenie about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie almost jumped with anger when she heard that Jace had suddenly given Frank a deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was about to fall into the abyss, so how did he manage to rise again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rather than giving the project to Frank, she'd rather hand the opportunity to her father before the contract was signed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie immediately took Jeff to meet Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Queenie and Jeff entered the Foliot Mansion, Diana received a video from Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil: [Diana, the Marsh family is still leeching. Thanks for helping me back then; otherwise, with my temper, I might have given them the deal.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied: [It only means your death wasn't undeserved.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past life, though Cecil died, his greatest pain was being betrayed by the person he trusted most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He trusted Queenie, pampering her like a sister, never expecting that the one to take his life would be the one he cherished the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil smiled when he saw the message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil: [Diana, I was foolish, but don't worry, I won't let her get away with it.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [I'm not reassured, because you're no match for her.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was mischievous, but only with minor antics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For ordinary people, such antics would be unbearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ordinary people have to work and live; they don't have time to visit hospitals every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Queenie had Steven, her powerful backing, and that mysterious man who stayed hidden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't understand why she had never seen that man in her past life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a headache coming on as she mentally sorted through all the men she had encountered in her past life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She always felt Steven's treatment of Queenie was inconsistent. Sometimes good, sometimes bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil: [Diana, you underestimate me.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [Sorry, but with your level of intelligence, I really can't overestimate you.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what Cecil didn't know was that the day would soon come.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="307.html">« Prev</a><a href="309.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
