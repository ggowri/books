Lying down, she quickly drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "When you're really worn out, there's no energy left for aimless thoughts."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sleep was deep. When Steven came in later that night, she didn't stir at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven moved quietly, slipping into bed beside her. Watching her as she slept, a soft smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he sighed, feeling a bit helpless. She was his wife, yet he felt like a thief sneaking into bed just to be near her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since their wedding, there had been no intimacy between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't usually one to indulge in physical desires, but something about the warmth of Diana's presence and the faint scent of her hair stirred him. He leaned in, inhaled her scent, and then closed his eyes, falling asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Diana woke up around nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A night of deep rest left her skin glowing, and she felt refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting up, she took a deep breath. Seeing the snowy view outside her window, she smiled softly. A new day had begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a good night's sleep, her mood was bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't even noticed that Steven had spent the night beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up her phone from the nightstand and checked the time. It was already past nine. Steven was already at the office, which meant she didn't have to make breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she was meeting Alexander to review her spring fashion designs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting ready, Diana headed downstairs to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise, breakfast was already prepared on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bowl of oatmeal sat there, along with a note.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana picked up the note and saw it was from Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It read: [Diana, I left you some oatmeal. I have an engagement tonight, so I won't be home for dinner.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt even more surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they'd lived together before, even when she knew he wouldn't be home, she'd leave him notes if she had to go out. But Steven never seemed to notice them since they'd always still be there when she returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would eat the snacks she left for him, but the notes were left untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Diana sat down to enjoy her oatmeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, she had arranged to meet Alexander at noon, and they planned to have lunch together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since there was no rush, she returned to her room to continue working on her designs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At eleven, she left to meet Alexander at the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her designs in hand, she entered the restaurant. Just as she was about to take the elevator, she saw Steven arriving with Evan and an elegant woman beside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Capitole, the city's top restaurant. It was known for its excellent cuisine and soundproof private rooms, making it ideal for business meetings.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman with Steven was stunning, with an amazing figure. Despite the cold weather, she wore a strikingly revealing outfit. Her makeup was flawless, and she exuded the confidence of a powerful businesswoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused for a moment when she saw them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Steven looking her way, she gave him a polite nod, pretending not to know him, and then looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. Diana's brief, indifferent glance made it obvious she intended to act like a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan noticed the strange interaction and couldn't help but feel curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "Did they have another argument?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them stepped into the elevator. A cold draft swept in, carrying the overpowering scent of the woman's perfume.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stiffened slightly, feeling the perfume's intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered that Steven didn't like strong perfumes, and neither did she.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a slow breath, pressing her lips together. Thankfully, they arrived at the fifth floor quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven," the woman said, "after lunch, shall we go to the hotel to sign the contract?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="745.html">« Prev</a><a href="747.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
