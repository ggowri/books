She loved moments of victory, especially the way people looked up to her during those times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, she said, "Mr. Foster, apologies, okay? I got a little carried away and stole your thunder. But don't worry, even after you sold out Mr. Wyatt Farley, he still speaks up for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo burst into laughter at her words, his grin stretching wide. He glanced at Wyatt, whose face was heavy with anguish, and sighed dramatically, "Oh, Wyatt. You can't trust people so easily, you know? Especially partners like us&mdash;it's even riskier to trust one another. Look at Queenie. She's the perfect example. She spent over 20 years basking in Paula's love and gave nothing in return. And yet, Queenie ended up with her adoptive mother's company. Now, that's what I call real business skills. Wyatt, only the ruthless ones get the sweet rewards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face darkened at Carlo's remark, interpreting it as a jab at her ruthlessness. Still, she didn't let anger show; after all, she and Carlo had ongoing collaborations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt sneered, "If she can manipulate me so easily, don't you think she can do the same to you, Mr. Foster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo chuckled confidently. He had, of course, been wary of Queenie. In the business world, there were no real friends. He said, "Wyatt, that's where you're wrong. My partnership with Queenie came long before you. Don't bother trying to stir the pot&mdash;she won't turn on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was momentarily stunned, just realizing that he was the real fool in all of this. Anger churned inside him, impossible to suppress, leaving him seething. He gritted his teeth and spat, "You snakes. Whatever you snatch from me won't last. Even if my company ends up in your hands, how long do you think you'll keep it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked arrogantly, saying, "Oh, you don't need to worry about that. I didn't scheme against you. I've always been straightforward in my dealings. I partnered with you sincerely, without any tricks up my sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when your son got into trouble, I worried you wouldn't be in the right mindset to manage your company. That could've affected my interests, so I teamed up with Mr. Foster. In business, one wrong move can lead to utter ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't about me being ruthless, Mr. Wyatt Farley. I simply made a decision any businessperson would make."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt felt as though the weight of her words crushed his chest. The betrayal of a former close friend was a cruel awakening, leaving him in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Queenie and Carlo discussed the acquisition terms. Wyatt was so furious he couldn't utter a word. All he could hope was that his son wasn't guilty of murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Diana had already seen the news of Samuel's arrest for murder. She sat in the Gellar Group's office, waiting for Luna's investigation results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna returned quickly, walking over to Diana with a mocking smile. "You were spot on, Diana. Queenie and George are already in Wyatt's office, using Samuel's arrest as leverage to acquire his company. Should we head over? Mr. Farley has already gone over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, "Let's go. I wouldn't want to miss the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna grinned. "Do you think Queenie will be scared out of her mind when she sees you alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Luna, you underestimate Queenie. Whether I'm alive or not doesn't matter to her. As long as she can seize the moment and acquire Wyatt's company at a low price, she wins. She doesn't care if I'm dead or alive&mdash;she'll simply do whatever benefits her the most in the moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was left speechless. People like Queenie never failed to astonish her. But the sheer malice of it all made Luna shudder just thinking about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna then wheeled Diana toward Wyatt's company. Meanwhile, Steven monitored Diana's every move through the surveillance cameras.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the swelling on Steven's face had gone down considerably. The uninjured side looked pale, but his expression remained as composed and aloof as ever. With his gaze slightly lowered, he carried an air of icy elegance, like a marble statue carved with precision and grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's worry was evident as he asked, "Mr. Gellar, why is Diana getting involved in this mess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled faintly, and even though he was seated in a wheelchair, his commanding presence was impossible to ignore. His gaze held the quiet arrogance of someone born to lead. He replied, "She's not just there for the show&mdash;everything is unfolding exactly as she planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, Queenie won't have her way. After Christmas, she'll walk right into the trap, and it'll all come to an end. As for the Mysterium Organization, if nothing's turned up, it's not worth chasing. My grandfather might already have the answers I need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Steven raised his hand, lightly stroking his chin, watching Diana's retreating figure before glancing at himself in the wheelchair. A faint, almost mocking smile played on his lips. He couldn't help but think that they were two sides of the same coin, both trapped by their struggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was startled. "But Mr. Edward Gellar has been abroad for a year. It seems like he won't be back for Christmas either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes. "Diana's grandpa isn't coming back for Christmas as well, right?" The sudden comment left Evan confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't bother to explain and simply said, "Send someone to follow Diana. Make sure she doesn't get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan, still lost in thought over Steven's cryptic remark, was snapped back to reality by his order and quickly left to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Cecil had already arrived at Wyatt's office. Inside, Queenie and Carlo had agreed on a price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo, thrilled at the opportunity to reap the benefits, was practically giddy with excitement. Grinning, he looked at Wyatt and said, "Well, Wyatt, conservatively speaking, the shares you hold are worth 500 million dollars. Why don't you sell them all to us?" Wyatt's face turned bright red with anger. He couldn't even speak, his furious glare doing all the talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold, mocking voice came from behind Carlo. "You're delusional, Mr. Foster. Five hundred million dollars for Uncle Wyatt's company, which is worth billions? You must be out of your mind." Everyone turned abruptly toward the door to see Cecil leaning leisurely against the doorframe, a playful smirk on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope at Cecil's words. Overwhelmed with relief, Wyatt called out excitedly, "Cecil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Queenie looked at Cecil, a storm of emotions swept through her. In her dreams, he was long gone by now. The Farley family had already fallen into her and George's hands. In that dream, she stood at the pinnacle of success. With Cecil gone, Diana would be the next to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's voice was calm and deliberate as she said, "Cecil, you're still alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil froze, his gaze fixed on her, cold and venomous, with a hint of red at the corners of his eyes. A flicker of confusion crossed his face, wondering why Queenie would say such a thing. His eyes glinted with icy sharpness as he said, "Queenie, even if you </span><span>died, I'd still live another hundred years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie heard that, her hand at her side clenched tightly. She couldn't help but wonder, "Did Cecil come here to save Wyatt? This deal is as good as done&mdash;there's no way I'll let Cecil ruin it. If he tries, I'll make sure he pays with his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, she asked calmly, "What exactly are you doing here, Cecil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil found it almost amusing, his eyes relaxed and indifferent as he regarded her. "Queenie, you've been messing with the Farley family. Do you think I wouldn't step in?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="938.html">« Prev</a><a href="940.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
