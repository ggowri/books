Finding this man is the only way to clear up the misunderstanding between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been investigating for so long without finding a single clue. This person has hidden himself well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Queenie and he were in a relationship, even if Diana exposes her as the other woman, they can't touch Queenie. Once the man who looks identical to me comes forward to clarify things, all of Diana's preparations will fall apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan frowned deeply. He had been investigating that man as well but hadn't turned up anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd checked the hotel but found no record of Queenie staying there.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The case was tricky, and too much time had passed to find solid leads.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, what if Ms. Bishop misunderstands? Things are already impossible between you two. If you're helping Queenie..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know what I'm doing. Don't concern yourself with this matter. We can't reveal that she's my wife yet, it would put her life in danger. While she stays in the shadows, those illegitimate children will hold back their tactics. The more she keeps a low profile, the less they'll take her seriously, and the safer she'll be. Meanwhile, we'll speed things up on our end. I'll make sure those illegitimate children never recover. Every scheme they've plotted, I'll make them pay for all of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was captivating, deep, and rich like it was rising slowly from the depths of a canyon, carrying an irresistible magnetism.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan paused for a moment, finally noticing that Steven was in a great mood today, the dark circles under his eyes wholly gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, how should we handle the situation now? Ms. Bishop's reputation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven fixed him with a stern look. "Why do you keep calling her Ms. Bishop? She's married! She's my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan froze, remembering he'd already explained this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine, Mrs. Gellar, then. But Mrs. Gellar's reputation is in the gutter right now. What should we do? People online are dragging her through the mud."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven visibly perked up at hearing "Mrs. Gellar", tilting his head with a knowing smile. "She'll handle it. Just give her some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, holding her while they slept, he'd fallen into the deepest, most satisfying sleep he'd had in ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan couldn't follow his boss' logic. "Mr. Gellar, this is the perfect opportunity. If you just help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. She's more than capable of handling something this trivial."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Evan a dismissive glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like they'd have to wait for Diana to come forward and clear this up for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff flew into a rage after seeing Queenie's press conference and called to tear into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you lost your mind, Queenie? How could you do this to me? After everything I've done for you, this is how you repay me? I'm your father! How dare you drag up the past in front of all those people? My company's already bankrupt! What more do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in her office, Queenie was over the moon to see her follower count hit five million.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using Diana and Jeff as stepping stones had worked perfectly, and her publicity had skyrocketed to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, she'd be the queen bee of the entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, I only spoke the truth. What's wrong with that? Are you going to report me? Think about your situation! If you do that, you'll lose everything. Can you even afford your medical treatment right now? Just stay quiet, and I'll take care of you in your old age."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff froze, taking in what he'd become. He could barely stand to look at himself anymore.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="729.html">« Prev</a><a href="731.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
