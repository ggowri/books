He has his methods. What are you afraid of? Let&#x27;s just wait for his good news.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A flash of anger crossed Queenie&#x27;s face. Thinking of his father made her even more furious. &quot;Good news? What good news can your father possibly have? All he knows is women. He even showed up late for something so important today, and you still expect anything from him?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">That old bastard was so hateful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just the thought of him made Queenie boil with anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;Counting on that old fool is less reliable than counting on myself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George frowned and said, &quot;You don&#x27;t need to concern yourself with what my father is doing. I don&#x27;t know all the details either, but I do know it&#x27;s very secretive. The people behind him are incredibly powerful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;There are secrets I don&#x27;t know, but I can tell you that Diana will absolutely not win.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George&#x27;s gaze softened as he pinched her cheek.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This intimate gesture lifted Queenie&#x27;s mood slightly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she still felt humiliated and frustrated by today&#x27;s events.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie picked up on the deeper meaning in his words and grabbed his arm. She asked, &quot;George, what do you mean that your father has powerful backers?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, this must stay between us. Behind my father is a massive organization. They&#x27;ve been working for years to find a strategy to get the company listed. The capitalists backing him are extraordinarily wealthy. All you need to know is that the money you want will be there.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His words instantly reassured Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her anger dissipated as she gazed at George with a cold determination. &quot;George, Diana&#x27;s new product launch must be stopped. As long as her new product doesn&#x27;t hit the market, she&#x27;ll be out of the game, and the Gellar Group will still be ours.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;George, I was too impatient earlier. I understand that these things need to be done step by step.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George looked at her delicate and alluring face. Once she calmed down, she was indeed a smart woman. Behind her was a team of elite professionals managing her company effectively.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In these aspects, she had always excelled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Over the past year, her personality had become even more composed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, I know you&#x27;ve been wronged but trust me. Wait a little longer, and my father will have good news for us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A glint of murderous intent flashed in his eyes. &quot;If we could kill Steven, we can kill Diana, too. Before she finds out who I am, I&#x27;ll deal with her.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie felt a surge of happiness at his words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took a deep breath and called for Mario to come in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ms. Marsh, Mr. Gellar,&quot; Mario entered and greeted respectfully.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;They are finally together.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario, having waited for this day for years, felt a sense of relief and joy that surpassed anyone else&#x27;s.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie asked, &quot;Mario, where&#x27;s Eric? Why hasn&#x27;t he shown up these past few days?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario frowned. &quot;He hasn&#x27;t been to the company for several days and hasn&#x27;t called me either. I tried reaching him, but no one answered. I&#x27;m not sure where he is.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie furrowed her brows, thinking, &quot;Could he be at the hospital, accompanying Gale for surgery?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even if Gale&#x27;s legs are treated, he&#x27;s still useless.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She scoffed, &quot;Useless man. He claimed to help me, yet he runs off when things get tough.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought for a moment and looked at Mario. &quot;Mario, go look for him. Where did he go?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was still useful to her. She wanted to use Eric to kill Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Being betrayed by her own brother would surely devastate Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana might claim indifference, but deep down, she cared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario smiled, &quot;Understood, Ms. Marsh. I&#x27;ll call you as soon as I find him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie instructed, &quot;Before that, check the hospital I visited earlier. He might be there taking care of Gale. By the way, see if Gale&#x27;s surgery was successful.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Understood!&quot; Mario replied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie exhaled deeply, turning to George. &quot;George, the Christmas is approaching. This year, we can finally spend it together.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George pulled her gently into his arms. &quot;Queenie, we&#x27;ve known each other since we were young. All these years, you&#x27;ve always been by my side. Without you, I wouldn&#x27;t be where I am today.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ll make sure to spend this Christmas with you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie pursed her lips, smiling softly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She hadn&#x27;t achieved everything she wanted, but she had gained the love she desired.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;George, I know I&#x27;ve wronged you in the past. But now that we&#x27;re together, it&#x27;s time to clear out the other women around you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With George back, she no longer cared about other men.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His eyes flickered over her face. &quot;Alright. I understand. Let&#x27;s go. No more work today. Let&#x27;s head back and rest.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was exhausted, both physically and emotionally.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But what she didn&#x27;t know was that to George, she was merely a pawn.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She said gently, &quot;Okay!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as they were about to leave, Queenie&#x27;s phone rang. Seeing it was her mother calling, her face grew cold. Her mother&#x27;s calls were rarely for good news.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hello!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, bad news! Noah&#x27;s company overseas has been acquired. He&#x27;s been accused of tax evasion, and the stock prices have plummeted. Overnight, he&#x27;s lost countless clients, and even the shareholders have turned against him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;His company is finished!&quot; Amelie shouted excitedly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Queenie stumbled back in shock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George caught her, preventing her from falling.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What happened? How could the company just collapse overnight?&quot; Queenie shouted in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;Could Noah&#x27;s sudden return be due to trouble at the company?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Wait. Why did he come back all of a sudden? Did you find out if it&#x27;s because the company&#x27;s in trouble?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was on the verge of breaking down. The series of unexpected events had completely blindsided her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I don&#x27;t know! He got a call earlier, ran downstairs, and cried to me. Queenie, you need to think of a solution. That company was worth billions of dollars! I swindled all that money from Jeff over the years to help him develop abroad.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Now it&#x27;s all gone. Half an hour ago, he left. I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s coming to find you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie sobbed uncontrollably.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie furiously hung up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She leaned against George, thinking they were all useless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Years of effort had been destroyed in a single night.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;Noah, that incompetent fool. He&#x27;s always bragged about his successful ventures abroad, yet he&#x27;d gone bankrupt overnight.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">While Queenie was still thinking, the door to her office was suddenly pushed open.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A plump Noah rushed in, his voice trembling. &quot;Queenie, please save me! My company is doomed!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before Queenie could respond, Noah mistook George for Steven. He grabbed George&#x27;s hand, pleading desperately, &quot;Mr. Gellar, I know you&#x27;re capable. You&#x27;ll marry my sister in the future. You must help me get my company back. You will help me, right?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="922.html">« Prev</a><a href="924.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
