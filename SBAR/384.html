She had no time to consider who the other person was; she just wanted to get him out of danger as quickly as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Summoning all her strength, she pulled the man and swam frantically towards the surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she broke through the water, Diana shouted, "Paige, quick, help me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige froze for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought she might have misheard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige had just reeled in her fishing line. She wasn't cut out for fishing. She had nearly been pulled into the sea by a fish that was too big for her to handle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the line had snapped, and she had barely escaped the ordeal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Annoyed and ready to give up on fishing, she then heard Diana's call for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dropping her fishing rod, she saw Diana struggling to drag a man toward the shore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was taken aback, not expecting that Diana had gone diving to fish and could even rescue someone who had fallen into the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She noticed a shark not far away, and her pupils dilated in fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly waded into the water to help, though she wasn't a strong swimmer. Luckily, the water near the shore was shallow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, with her strength, had already reached the shore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige rushed over to assist, and together, they pulled Frank out of the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The shark arrived just moments later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was startled but relieved she had moved quickly. Otherwise, the situation could have been fatal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige patted her chest, her heart racing. The shark, having missed its target, swam away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn, Diana, the sea is way too dangerous. We should stop coming here," Paige said, catching her breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she looked down at the man lying on the ground, she froze in shock. "Wait, it's Frank? What the hell is he doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was equally surprised to see that it was Frank. She hadn't expected that in this lifetime, she would be the one to save him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She recalled that in her previous life, Frank had been found by fishermen three days later, his lower back injured after hitting rocks, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in that state, Frank had still pampered Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frowning, Diana noticed his leg was profusely bleeding as though it had been pierced by something sharp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The flesh around the wound floated in the water, torn and dangling. She felt Frank must have been in excruciating pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a deep breath and closed her eyes, feeling a surge of old resentment. In her past life, because she played the piano better than Queenie, Frank had ordered kidnappers to break her fingers while he lay comfortably in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Snapping her eyes open, she still chose to save Frank. After all, she was a doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Out at sea, many unexpected situations would arise, so Diana always carried a first aid kit on her boat. She swam to the speedboat, gracefully leaped aboard, and grabbed the medical kit before returning to shore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used scissors to cut Frank's pants and looked at the hole in his thigh, feeling a sense of satisfaction inside. She understood that kind of pain all too well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After disinfecting the wound, she bandaged it with gauze and then began CPR on Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her movements were rough, pressing hard on his chest. After several minutes, Frank coughed up water and began to regain consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige, watching Diana's aggressive actions, grew a little concerned. "Diana, maybe be a bit gentler. Don't break his ribs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shot her a cold glare. "You feel sorry for him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige suddenly felt the intensity of her death stare and quickly shook her head. "No way, I don't feel sorry for him at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside, Diana was consumed by a strong, simmering hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the memories of her past life now intact, she had no intention of tolerating the shameless people around her any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "they had all fallen for Queenie's cheap tricks. What a bunch of fools!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had a sweet, innocent face that easily made people lower their guard around her. It was all too easy for her to deceive people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thankfully, Diana now had the memories of her past life. Otherwise, she would have been fooled by Queenie again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank coughed up more water, blinking as he opened his eyes. When he saw Diana, he was shocked. "Diana, it's you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige, irritated, snapped, "What rotten luck! You were nearly shark food, and if it weren't for Diana, you'd be gone by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She added bitterly, "After everything you and your family put her through, Diana still pulled you out of the sea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank, dazed, stared at Diana in her diving suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't believe that it was Diana who had saved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned, cutting him off. "Shut up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... What happened to me? Paige, weren't we supposed to be on a trip? How did I end up in the sea?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="383.html">« Prev</a><a href="385.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
