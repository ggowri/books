We're family, so let's stop talking about money. It's bad for relationships. Come on. Let's go get the paperwork sorted and transfer the land to my name. When Queenie comes back, I'll give it to her. She's going to be over the moon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and when Queenie comes back, make sure you stay out of sight. You know she can't stand you. If you upset her and make her cry, I won't let you off easy. Don't think giving me this land is going to earn you any favors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed, more amused than angry. "Eric, your father really did a number on you and your brothers, didn't he? Why on earth do you think I'd just give you the land? Like I said, no five billion, no deal. End of story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so protective of Queenie, but you can't even cough up five billion for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you... Diana, are you playing me?" Eric's face darkened with rage, and he raised his hand, ready to strike her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could swing, his wrist was caught by an iron grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned, startled, and found himself staring into the icy eyes of Alexander. Stunned, he blurted, "Who... who the hell are you? Let go of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him and looked at Diana with concern. "Diana, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and shook her head. "I'm fine, Alexander. What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just handling some business nearby. I bought a piece of land, came over to finalize the deal, and saw you walking out with the seller. I didn't want to interrupt, but I didn't expect to walk in on this little drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is shameless. Want me to call the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana waved him off. "No need. He's just a pawn in someone else's game. Once he's outlived his usefulness, they'll toss him aside. Let someone else get their hands dirty. We don't need to bother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally let go of Eric, giving him a sharp, silent warning with his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, sensing the shift in power, decided to turn his frustration on Diana. "Who is this guy, anyway? Your new fling, Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Diana slapped him hard across the face. "Watch your mouth, Eric, before you say something even more disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, Alexander," Diana said, her smile bright and carefree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana! You're not going anywhere!" Eric yelled, rushing in front of her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Alexander, sneering. "Hey, you! Don't tell me the money she used to buy the land came from you? You have no idea who she really is, do you? She's just a country bumpkin. Didn't even finish high school. She knows nothing about real estate. Don't let her scam you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze darkened. "Sir, be careful with your accusations. Diana is my business partner, and she's more than capable of handling her own finances. Why would she need anyone else's money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of slandering others, maybe you should work on your own intelligence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was left speechless, glaring but unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Diana. Join me for lunch? You've been spoiling me with lobster, and I haven't had a chance to return the favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Sure! Things are pretty quiet now that the design project's wrapped up. Winter's almost here, and I'm getting ready for it. Tobias is coming back in a few days, and Julius is flying in for my birthday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, though, was still sulking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Your brother is doing great overseas. I ran into him on my last trip. He kept reminding me to look after you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's just how he is. He's always finding someone he trusts to watch over me when he can't do it himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and your brothers seem really close."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's smile softened, tinged with a bit of sadness. "Yeah, we are. I hurt them a lot over the past couple of years. Chasing after the wrong people, I distanced myself from the ones who really cared about me. But I've made amends, and they've forgiven me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric's face twisted with rage as he listened. He had no idea Diana had such strong connections, let alone brothers.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="452.html">« Prev</a><a href="454.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
