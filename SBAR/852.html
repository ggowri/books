Steven's cold and handsome face suddenly darkened. He exuded a terrifying aura, and his eyes were now shrouded in a burning rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He passed Yanson and quickly chased after Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he called Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan, prepare the heating equipment and bring it to the basement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan asked, "Mr. Gellar, have you found Ms. Sutton?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven replied, "Not yet. Prepare the heating equipment first. Quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temperature in the basement was more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. There was no heating, and the chill was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not certain whether Paige was in the basement. Only by making preparations in advance could they rescue her in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said, "Okay, Mr. Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up and went to prepare the heating equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after taking a few steps, he spotted two men acting stealthily in the parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was cautious and followed them secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, Paige has been freezing in the basement for half an hour. If it continues, she might get killed. Should we let her out now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned, thinking, "Ms. Marsh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the way, is Ms. Sutton in the basement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon sent a message to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mr. Gellar, I bumped into those men who took Ms. Sutton away. She is in the basement. They called the mastermind Ms. Marsh.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's eyes were icy. She was vicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time they met, he would be wary of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pivoted around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Evan was struck on the forehead with a heavy blow.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before catching a glimpse of the culprit, he collapsed limply to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario glared at the two bodyguards with a stern expression. "You idiots, you didn't even know you were being followed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashamed, they lowered their heads and stared at Mario. "Mr. Gillespie, sorry, we were wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario glanced at Evan, who was Steven's most powerful right-hand man. If he died, it would be a huge blow to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him out and throw him into the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards were slightly dumbfounded. "Mr. Gillespie, well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up. You have been exposed. Leave here immediately. Don't get caught or affect our plan. I will give each of you one million dollars, and you can go out and hide for a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the sum of money, they dragged Evan away without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was about to go to the basement from the parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she rushed over, the two bodyguards drove past her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Luna stumbled over something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked down at it. Her eyes widened in shock. She quickly took out her cell phone to call Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was stunned. As she gazed at the phone under the car, hers instantly slipped to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was Evan's cell phone here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna squatted down and took his cell phone out from under the car. Thinking of the car that had just passed her, she had a premonition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said worriedly, "Evan is in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her impression, Evan was a very responsible man. His speech and actions were somewhat humorous, and his way of dealing with people made her feel comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna quickly pivoted around and drove to chase after the car. She was not sure whether Evan was in that car, but her instinct affirmed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger premonition is that something has happened to Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna sped away. At the same time, she turned on her laptop and checked the nearby surveillance.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="851.html">« Prev</a><a href="853.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
