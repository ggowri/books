She picked up some local specialties, intending to send them to Olivia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The spicy grilled chicken that Olivia favored smelled delicious. It was her habit to snack while watching TV in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana checked the production date and found it satisfactory. She bought extra and sent it directly to Olivia's home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana," Cecil sauntered in, wearing casual attire, smiling warmly at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled back, "Let's go. You've been around here for a while. You must know quite a few places with great food. How about we go for some grilled meat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna, however, steered clear of grilled meat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Bishop, I don't feel like having grilled meat. You two go ahead. I'm not a fan," Luna declined, not wanting to play the third wheel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, if Queenie was indeed behind Cecil's predicament, and now that she knew Diana had rescued him, Queenie would certainly not let Diana off the hook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna had to be prepared in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had previously shared her plan with Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, you go ahead and have what you like. We'll stroll some more after dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna nodded impassively. "Alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil watched Luna leave. She seemed aloof, not one for conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is Luna always this cold?" he asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, she's been this way since childhood, but she's very capable," Diana praised with a beaming smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil could tell that Luna was not only cold in demeanor but also exceptional in skills and abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smiled meaningfully, "Diana, the people around you are quite extraordinary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana chuckled but remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Indeed, she grew up in an extraordinary family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her closest aides, Luna, Nolan, Iris, and Aiden, were all orphans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nolan was the first orphan Diana encountered. She let him name himself. He said, "Ms. Bishop, thank you for letting me study with you. I'll call myself Nolan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Later, Diana met Luna, who chose a name similar in meaning to Diana's. Aiden and Iris also picked their own names.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were sent to an orphanage at birth, not knowing their surnames, so they casually named themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Iris and Aiden were a bit younger. They were studying abroad and would graduate next year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All of them were gifted and now stood out among their peers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana did not grow up alone in this life. She had people she loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn't understand why her past self had insisted on the scant love from the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this new life, she still couldn't figure it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, what's wrong?" Cecil called her again, noticing her deep in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana snapped back to reality and smiled at him. The light illuminated her bright face. In Cecil's eyes, her smile was as bright and warm as rosy clouds and blazing fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That smile also fell like a beam of light into Steven's eyes not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her smile seemed to carry a sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt anxious and restless but couldn't grasp the fading light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He watched as Diana and Cecil walked away, chatting and laughing together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil was quite talkative and seemed to have many common topics with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They chatted happily all the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ever since Diana wanted a divorce, Steven could always see her lively and vivid self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And he was like a lion living in the dark since childhood, gloomy and fierce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at the bright Diana, and a sentence suddenly popped into his mind. He didn't deserve her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said to Evan behind him, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan rubbed his empty stomach and asked with a smile, "Mr. Gellar, are we going to have dinner now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at the back of Diana and Cecil and said in a low voice, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was planning to "bump into" Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan thought, "Ms. Bishop loved you, but you didn't cherish it. What's the point of you pestering her now?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="179.html">« Prev</a><a href="181.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
