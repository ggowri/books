She was extremely disappointed with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned and looked at her with red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since he was a child, she had never hit him, and Gale was beaten so badly that he was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, why did you hit me? Don't you also dislike Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at her disappointed eyes, he felt inexplicably uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula couldn't believe that he would say such a thing. "Gale, even if you don't like her, you shouldn't find a man to destroy your sister. She is your biological sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If she hadn't been swapped, she would still be our princess. Why don't you think from her perspective?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She was replaced by someone with ulterior motives, which is why she has become a laughingstock among you. But is she a waste? She is now a design director.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She is already very pitiful, why don't you let her go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, Diana is right, none of us in the family are worthy of being her relatives, and you are even less worthy of being her eldest brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I will no longer care about your affairs, and I will not care whether you live or die, because you are born vicious, just like your father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could Jeff's descendants be good?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was an exception!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No wonder you like a woman like Penelope who slept with different men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you pay attention, you can see that Penelope is using you, but with your brain, even if I remind you, you may not recognize Penelope's true face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Althea is such a good girl, who did everything for your good, but in the end, she was hurt by you. It turns out that there is no good person in the Marsh family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't want these sons anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She glanced at Gale coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you dare to hurt your sister again, I will no longer recognize you as my son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula left in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale stood there in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He felt that Paula had changed. In the past, if she heard anything bad about Diana, she would call her a rebellious girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now she was speaking for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Diana's bad luck that she was replaced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't even graduate from high school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, she was not as good as Queenie, who was raised with their careful care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sometimes relationships wouldn't get better just because of blood ties, and strangers could have a better relationship than blood-related siblings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only Queenie was worthy of Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">People like Diana could only do ordinary jobs in the future and marry a man as ordinary as her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What qualifications did she have to be Steven's wife?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more Gale thought about it, the angrier he became. Now that Harry did such a thing, no one except Steven could get them out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because of Harry's matter, he didn't think much about what Paula had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had already determined that Diana was useless, so how could he see Diana's excellence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He heard the sound of something being smashed upstairs, and he hurried upstairs to see what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he opened the door, he saw that Queenie had smashed most of the things in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew that Queenie knew what happened to Harry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, I've already talked to Diana, but she's unwilling to issue a letter of understanding. Why don't you go ask Steven, he'll grant you whatever you ask for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Queenie vented her anger, she felt much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Gale, a hint of hatred in her eyes. Why did he let Harry and others teach Diana a lesson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry was loyal to her and framed Diana several times. It was because of their cooperation that Steven could not find any clues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you stupid? If you want to destroy someone like Diana, you should go to the bar. Only those people in the bar can serve Diana well. Why did you find Harry? Don't you know that he will go to jail if he is caught kidnapping?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now your friend is in jail because of you. What about his mother? His mother is disabled. How will she live without her son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned. Queenie was blaming him.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="125.html">« Prev</a><a href="127.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
