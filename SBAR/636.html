However, his mother married into the Robinson family this year, changing his status. His father has gotten him into the entertainment industry to grow up, and Levi's just as wealthy as Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of ecstasy flickered in Queenie's eyes. She was glad she had asked Mario to dig deeper into Levi's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, are you certain about your findings? We need to make sure everything is thorough. We can't afford any mistakes," Queenie replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi's origins had always been shrouded in mystery, even the director wasn't clear on where he came from. Yet, he had thrived in the entertainment world over the past few years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario reassured her, "Absolutely, Ms. Marsh. I've been tailing him all day, and I discreetly spoke with his assistant. The assistant confirmed that Levi and his father, Marvin Robinson, have been to the company several times, but they never reveal their identities."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt worried. "Good! Mario, just in case, go and confirm it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario responded, "Sure thing! But Ms. Marsh, are you really sure you want to do this? Don't you want the master anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't want me first. If he truly cared, he wouldn't have let me seduce Levi," Queenie scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Momentarily, Queenie was taken aback, realizing the master might already know about Levi's true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all these years, Queenie concluded it was time to awaken from her dreams. That man only wanted to return and had never genuinely cared about her. She needed to focus on herself, and marrying into a wealthy family was her ultimate goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she had helped Amelie achieve her dream of marrying Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had also completely gotten rid of Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and that man were merely partners.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, please think about it. I believe the master loves you, but circumstances have kept him from being open. You've supported each other for so long&mdash;do you really want to throw it all away?" Mario asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario found Queenie to be a complex person; she was gentle yet cunning and strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her personality seemed to shift constantly, reflecting her inner conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt irritated and aggrieved. "Mario, did he know about Levi's identity all along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't say for certain, Ms. Marsh; I just discovered this today," Mario replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie scoffed, "See? He's keeping secrets from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, don't act impulsively. I'll call the master and ask him. It seems you two need to talk," Mario said before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting on her bed, Queenie cried silently, overwhelmed by the feeling that everything was spiraling out of her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana had a restless night, plagued by another nightmare of her tragic death.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, go to hell!" Steven's malicious voice jolted her awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." Diana sat up abruptly, momentarily disoriented by her unfamiliar surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did she have a nightmare again?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a while since the last one.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes and sat up slowly. Grabbing her phone from the table, she checked the time&mdash;it was already eight in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, washed up, and went downstairs to prepare breakfast for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing sounds from the kitchen, Steven opened the door. Clad in a white oversized sweater, he leaned against the stairs, watching Diana cook with a smile creeping onto his face.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="635.html">« Prev</a><a href="637.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
