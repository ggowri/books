Breaking up other people&#x27;s lives?&quot;</p><p>Queenie let out a cold laugh.</p><p>&quot;Really, Paula? Defending Diana now? Let me tell you something—when it comes to love, if you&#x27;re not wanted, you&#x27;re the outsider. You and your daughter forced yourselves into someone else&#x27;s life. You&#x27;re the real intruders here. Unwanted. Unloved.&quot;</p><p>Her smirk deepened as she added, &quot;Oh,  you&#x27;re playing the saint now, standing up for Diana. Do you think she&#x27;ll thank you for it? You and your darling son tore her to pieces. She&#x27;ll never forgive you. And that, Paula, is exactly what I wanted to see all along.&quot;</p><p>Paula&#x27;s face twisted in anguish as she screamed, &quot;This is all your fault! Everything, every single thing, is because of you! You schemed against Diana, manipulated us into misunderstanding her, and pushed me to cast out my own daughter. It was all your plan, Queenie! You&#x27;re nothing but venomous to the core. Karma will get you!&quot;</p><p>But deep down, Paula knew the truth. It wasn&#x27;t just Queenie&#x27;s manipulations. It was her own foolishness and blindness.</p><p>Sometimes, one wrong step leads to a lifetime of regret. The human mind can be frightening, capable of making decisions in fleeting moments that leave scars forever.</p><p>Her voice cracked as she continued, &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for your lies and schemes, I would never have driven my own child out of our home.&quot;</p><p>At this point, Paula no longer cared about her dignity.</p><p>She just wanted her daughter to be safe and happy again.</p><p>She remembered how Diana had always craved her love.</p><p>Whenever Paula felt unwell, Diana would tirelessly figure out ways to nurse her back to health.</p><p>Even a simple smile from Paula could light up Diana&#x27;s entire day.</p><p>Back then, Paula could see Diana&#x27;s yearning for her affection. And yet...</p><p>Paula dared not dwell on those memories; they only intensified her regret and self-loathing.</p><p>All Diana&#x27;s patience and sacrifices had earned her was relentless cruelty from them.</p><p>&quot;Ah...&quot; Paula groaned in agony, clutching her chest.</p><p>Queenie, watching her crumble, burst into laughter. &quot;Oh, Paula, this is exactly what I wanted. I wanted to see you suffer like this. To watch your entire family drown in misery. Diana may be your biological daughter, but this wealth and luxury should have been mine alone. You brought her back and gave her everything, so don&#x27;t blame me for tearing your family apart.&quot;</p><p>Her smile turned venomous. &quot;You know, Diana&#x27;s greatest wish in this family was to feel your love. I understood her better than anyone. And every time you gave her your attention, I made sure to sabotage her. That way, you&#x27;d turn back to me.&quot;</p><p>She leaned in slightly, her eyes glinting with malice. &quot;But tell me, is it all my fault that Diana ended up like this? No. You&#x27;re to blame too. I only used the cracks in your family to hurt her, but the root cause was you. If you had truly cared about her, how could I have succeeded?&quot;</p><p>Her voice grew harsher. &quot;It was your indulgence that gave me the confidence to keep hurting her.</p><p>&quot;Your tolerance lets me cross every line.&quot;</p><p>Queenie&#x27;s laughter grew louder, her face twisted with malice. Watching Paula&#x27;s torment gave her more satisfaction than earning a fortune ever could.</p><p>Paula closed her eyes in despair. She knew Queenie was right. Her repeated forgiveness had allowed Queenie to hurt Diana over and over again.</p><p>Meanwhile, the live stream was flooded with furious comments.</p><p>[OMG, is this real? Queenie is beyond shameless. I can&#x27;t watch this anymore. I&#x27;m officially boycotting her!]</p><p>[Look at her scheming face. She&#x27;s the textbook definition of a backstabber. Karma will catch up to her sooner or later.]</p><p>[She&#x27;s such a good actress, pretending to be so innocent and pitiful. Who would&#x27;ve guessed her heart is so dark?]</p><p>At Queenie&#x27;s apartment, George was glued to the livestream, his face growing darker by the second. He called Queenie repeatedly, but no one answered.</p><p>He stared at her twisted expression on the screen, anger simmering. Queenie was always cautious, yet today she&#x27;d fallen straight into Paula&#x27;s trap.</p><p>It was clear Paula had baited her into exposing everything.</p><p>George clenched his fists. He knew Queenie&#x27;s acting career was finished.</p><p>He had banked on her making a fortune in the entertainment industry, but now everything was ruined.</p><p>Elsewhere, Steven and Evan were also watching the livestream.</p><p>Evan frowned and asked, &quot;Mr. Gellar, why hasn&#x27;t Ms. Barnes mentioned your name? You played a huge part in all this, yet she left you out. Why would she do that?&quot;</p><p>The question barely left his lips before Steven&#x27;s expression darkened.</p><p>Realizing his mistake, Evan forced an awkward laugh.</p><p>He murmured, &quot;Uh... never mind. Forget I said anything.&quot;</p><p>Steven shot him a cold glare. &quot;Because I gave everything to Diana. Ms. Barnes is grateful, so she didn&#x27;t mention me. And Queenie? She doesn&#x27;t want to drag George&#x27;s reputation through the mud.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s why neither of them brought up my name.&quot;</p><p>Evan raised an eyebrow but said nothing. He thought to himself, &quot;I&#x27;m glad he corrected himself in time. Otherwise, even I wouldn&#x27;t want to be around him.&quot;</p><p>He clicked his tongue. &quot;Queenie&#x27;s face is downright terrifying. Mr. Gellar, how did you ever treat her better than your own mother?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Evan!&quot; Steven barked, his voice sharp.</p><p>Evan flinched, taking a cautious step back.</p><p>Trying to change the subject, he added, &quot;By the way, Mr. Gellar, I found out Andrew has been out of the country recently.</p><p>&quot;I just found out about his travel records today. He hasn&#x27;t come back yet, so I think he must have some plans abroad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He left the Gellar Group office without a word. He must be planning to take the company back. Diana might be in danger soon.&quot; Evan analyzed.</p><p>Steven&#x27;s eyes narrowed, his voice cold. &quot;This time, I&#x27;ll protect her. I won&#x27;t let her get hurt again.&quot;</p><p>He turned off the live stream, disgusted by Queenie&#x27;s twisted face. His mind was already racing with plans to get back to Diana.</p><p>Diana, meanwhile, had just wrapped up a half-hour meeting.</p><p>When the meeting ended, Luna showed her Queenie and Paula&#x27;s live stream.</p><p>Looking at Queenie&#x27;s face on the screen, Diana immediately grasped the situation. She knew Paula was using the broadcast to destroy Queenie.</p><p>Listening to Queenie&#x27;s words, Diana&#x27;s heart ached.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t deny Queenie&#x27;s accusations. If not for Paula and Steven&#x27;s indulgence, Queenie wouldn&#x27;t have had the chance to hurt her so deeply.</p><p>Queenie was just a tool Paula had used to harm her.</p><p>Diana glanced at the comments in the live stream. Everyone now knew the truth.</p><p>She found it all pointless and smiled bitterly. &quot;What&#x27;s the point of all this now?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="983.html">« Prev</a><a href="985.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
