She shoved hard against his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Steven pulled her even closer, holding her tighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long moment, both were gasping for air. Reluctantly, Steven let her go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her flushed cheeks, he felt a surge of joy. Ever since her divorce, he'd dreamed of holding her like this, of kissing her like this. Now, he had that right. All he wanted was to hold her in his arms forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face flushed. Standing in the dim light, he looked even more mysterious and captivating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you're my wife. I can hold you, kiss you. Who the hell is Alexander? Does he dare try to take you from me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice carried a hint of jealousy, laced with undeniable authority.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled. "Steven, love doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t follow rules of who came first. Falling for someone happens in an instant."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander had become a thorn lodged deep in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, he never saw Alexander as a threat&mdash;because Diana's eyes had always been only on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Alexander was showing possessiveness toward Diana. He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t love her; he just wanted to claim her out of sheer dominance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stepped closer, his towering shadow completely enveloping Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His finger lightly tapped her cute nose. "Diana, I know love doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t care about who came first. Falling for someone happens in a heartbeat&mdash;just like you fell for me back then. You've given me everything over the years, but I love you too. Diana, people who love each other belong together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's voice was low, seductive, and utterly mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana could hardly resist his teasing charm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her heart skipped a beat. His strikingly handsome face was as captivating as ever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s heart wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t completely swayed by him. She wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t ready to forgive so easily. Her wounds needed time to heal. She needed time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew this wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t something he could rush.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, are you full?" Steven asked gently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied calmly, "I'm full. Let's go home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After paying the bill, Steven took her hand and led her downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The restaurant was packed, and coincidentally, Chloe was dining there too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe had seen everything that happened in Diana's private room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She recorded a video and sent it to Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Queenie and Mario were in the car. Her dress was already hiked up to her waist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario gripped her waist tightly, driving into her with unrelenting force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie reveled in the peak of pleasure brought by his relentless thrusts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario's desire was intense. He satisfied her in ways no other man ever had. Every time, he made her forget all her worries. Her mind went blank as she surrendered to the bliss!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario's phone buzzed, but he ignored it, letting out an excited groan. "Queenie, I want to hear your joyful sounds every single day from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Queenie's mind, she saw Steven's disdainful gaze. The man who would one day meet his end at her hands had the audacity to look down on her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure. I want this kind of happiness every single day," she replied with a sly smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's face flushed, her reason overwhelmed by desire. Her gaze grew more and more entranced with every passing moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, Mario finally stopped. He picked up his phone and checked it. It was a video from Chloe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After watching the video, he handed the phone to Queenie to watch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, take a look. Interesting, huh? Turns out Alexander likes Diana too. We can use him&mdash;let him go after Diana and help us take down Steven. What do you think of this plan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario knew a man's greatest weakness was always a woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alexander truly cared for Diana, he'd be willing to give up everything for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie frowned, jealousy flashing intensely in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does a man as exceptional as Alexander&hellip; like Diana too?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What makes Diana so deserving?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What gives her the right to have so many amazing men fall for her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie lowered her gaze to Mario and smiled. "Mario, tell me honestly. What kind of woman do you think Diana is? Is her charm really that irresistible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven brushed me off just to protect her. Even Mr. Powell is into her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario knew she wanted the truth, and he had no intention of dodging her question.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pictured Diana's face in his mind. That face was pure and captivating enough to leave an impression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "I won't deny her beauty. She's definitely gorgeous&mdash;the kind of woman any man would be drawn to."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I prefer your beauty. You're alluring, fiery, and irresistible. When we're together, it's pure bliss&mdash;a connection on a soul-deep level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how beautiful she is, if they have no shared interests or dreams, their souls won't resonate. Even if they share a bed, there'd be no joy in it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He loved Queenie. To him, she was the most beautiful. No other woman, no matter how stunning, could compare to the one in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie wasn't surprised by his answer. She knew Diana was undeniably beautiful too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let out a cold laugh. "Tomorrow morning, I'll meet Alexander myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been so focused on dealing with Diana that she forgot about Alexander. He could be a valuable ally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Powell Group wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t far from Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early in the morning, Queenie dressed to impress and headed over to see Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After his assistant informed him, Alexander agreed to see Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, draped in excessive luxury, sparkled with jewels from head to toe. Alexander frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat tall and poised on the sofa, one leg crossed over the other, his expression distant and indifferent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, is there something you need from me?" His voice was just as cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie arched a brow. It was clear&mdash;Alexander had no regard for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in her eyes, Alexander was pretending. She wanted nothing more than to tear off his facade and see who he truly was underneath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, I'm here to discuss a collaboration with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander spoke slowly, "Collaboration? What could you possibly offer that would interest me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mocking tone filled Queenie with a sharp sense of humiliation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised an eyebrow, studying Queenie. She looked innocent enough, with a pretty face, but her eyes were filled with calculation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still preferred Diana. Her vibrant, radiant personality was irresistible. Her smile was like a ray of sunlight for someone living in darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was lively and stunning, like a brilliant rainbow stretching across the sky&mdash;breathtakingly beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Queenie before him was like a glass of plain water&mdash;bland and utterly unremarkable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The vibrant and dazzling Diana only made him even more obsessed with having her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander straightened slightly, his tone firm as he rejected her proposal. "Diana doesn't like you, and I see no reason for us to work together either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only showed tenderness to those he truly cared for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's eyes burned with fury. For Diana, he was willing to forgo even a partnership.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's feelings for Diana were genuine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man she could never have, Diana had claimed effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all loyal to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet around her, the ones who cared for her were all useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled slowly and said, "Mr. Powell, I'm here to talk about Diana. I'll deliver her to your bed, let you have her, and then help you take over Steven's company. How does that sound for a deal?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1137.html">« Prev</a><a href="1139.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
