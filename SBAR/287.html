She had repeatedly warned him about Elsie's deceitful nature and how marrying her would not bring him happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, upon confirming the wedding date, he eagerly reached out to inform her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't expect Paige would be unwilling to attend his wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His life was going smoothly and successfully. Aside from being kicked out by Paula, everything else was going well for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank said, "Paige, I know you are just throwing a tanturm. We've known each other since we were kids. You'll find someone better in the future..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige interrupted him, "Of course, I can find someone better than you. Trash belongs in the trash can. I hope you two stay together forever and stay away from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she placed the last lobster in Diana's bowl and said, "When Julius returns, please arrange a meeting for us. I like him at first sight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. "Alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She then focused on her meal and chose to ignore Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was incensed. "Diana, did you say something to Paige?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Diana. I heard that you left the Marsh family and spoke ill of its members. You did wrong. Why did you slander your brothers?" Elsie chimed in, adding fuel to the fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana cast a cold glance at Elsie. She knew that the women associated with the Marsh family's sons were all arranged by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These women shared a penchant for turning things around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana questioned, "Elsie, do you truly believe you can live carefree just because Frank trusts you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie stared at Diana with a pained expression. "Diana, are you envious of Frank's care for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling disgusted at her hypocrisy, Paige snapped, "Shut up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige, you..." Elsie began to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige's eyes blazed with anger. "Diana, our dinner is ruined. I don't want to be around this cheeky couple. Why don't we go eat somewhere else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana surveyed the table full of seafood and hesitated to waste it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, Paige, just leave them be," she suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige turned to Frank and offered a bright smile, "Frank, congratulations. You and Elsie are a perfect match. I wish you both happiness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was taken aback. Her sarcastic well-wishes left him feeling quite displeased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Paige ignored the two and chatted with Diana. "Diana, I heard you're now the director of a fashion design company. Do you need models? I've been training a group of models and want to take them to a beach fashion show."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was also considering hiring female models. She nodded, "I've already signed on 10 male models. I'm in need of 10 female models. Our company will be participating in the winter fashion show."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Perfect, let's work together. When I return from my business trip, I'll bring you to my company. I've trained a group of exceptional models," Paige proposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her business trip aimed to organize a beach fashion show. Her company was hosting the event, hoping to boost its popularity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana considered that a successful beach show could enhance her company's reputation. She replied, "Sure. I have 10 well-trained male models. I'm planning to launch a men's fashion line. You can discuss it with your father. I'll send over the proposal tomorrow. If you're okay with it, we can finalize the contract."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="286.html">« Prev</a><a href="288.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
