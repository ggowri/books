Diana cried while watching it till the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lucy, Micah's master, didn't know it was Micah's blood. Lucy rescued Micah because of a trick by her senior Meredith as Micah had special blood that could control the evil nature inside Lucy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Micah's blood was taken, he grew weaker day by day. He was thin yet good-looking. He was bewitched by his junior Catherine, who told him that Lucy was a blood-sucking demon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Catherine plotted against Lucy from time to time. Lucy knew about her tricks, but she never blamed her because Micah believed in Catherine unconditionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Micah, Steven's mirror image, and understood Lucy's feelings very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was because Micah always blamed Lucy for no reason because of Catherine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lucy saw that Micah only smiled in front of Catherine, so knowing that Catherine was a bad person, she still chose to tolerate her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in the end, Catherine feigned death, causing Micah to completely turn evil. He wore a black robe, which set off his chiseled face and gloomy eyes. And with his amazing acting skills, the movie was just terrific.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Master, have you ever had me in your heart? Have you ever liked me?" Micah looked at Lucy, who fell to the ground after being stabbed, with his bloodshot eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lucy was dressed in white, stained with blood, and as enchanting as the red spider lily on the roadside of the underworld.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, it involved both the calculation of Meredith and Catherine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meredith did it for love, while Catherine did it for status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That caused Lucy and Micah to become enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Catherine kept framing Lucy, but Micah tolerated and trusted Catherine, which led to deeper and deeper misunderstanding between Lucy and Micah.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, they had to fight to the death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lucy, the heroine, was lying on the ground with blood on her face and mouth, looking both miserable and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Micah intently and said with a smile, "Micah, I did not know, nor did I want to take your blood to suppress the evil nature inside me. I saved you back then and treated you sincerely. I treated Catherine well and have never hurt her. Why don't you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Humph! Lucy, I respect you as my master, but you have done all the evil, taking my blood and killing Catherine, who has been so kind to me since childhood. You... deserve to die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Micah plunged his knife deep into Lucy's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lucy looked at him in pain and tried hard to sit up straight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under Micah's shocked gaze, she pulled out his knife with force and took out his blood, which was scarlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was on the verge of death and had no time to say too much. She just looked at Micah with heartache, "Micah, I'll give you your blood back. I've never done any of the things you say I did to Catherine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, I'm no longer your master."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Lucy finished speaking, she fell to the ground and died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Micah stared blankly at the scene, unable to believe that Lucy had not dodged his knife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No... why didn't you dodge my knife? Are you trying to make me feel guilty? Do you want me to feel guilty for the rest of my life? Why are you so vicious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He cruelly pressed the blood back into Lucy's body, but Lucy remained motionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Micah, Catherine is still alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Larry, Micah's junior, ran over and told him the news in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Micah looked at Larry with bloodshot eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Larry looked at Lucy lying on the ground and sneered, "Micah, you killed this demon. You can finally be with Catherine, and no one will stop you from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Micah felt something was wrong when he heard that. "What do you mean by that? Why should I be with Catherine?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="429.html">« Prev</a><a href="431.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
