Getting things easily will become a habit for you. You plagiarized this time, and it will definitely happen again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sighed, "Well, you are an excellent designer. The saddest thing in the world is to be let down by others and then yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma smiled bitterly, "Even if I left the Aria Group, Mr. Murphy took it well. Although I was the chief designer, there was a more outstanding designer named Claire."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana narrowed her eyes. "I used to admire your designs. Mr. Murphy liked your work when you were at the Aria Group. I understand your desire for a higher position, but your approach is inappropriate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma immediately burst into tears. She covered her face and thought she was really stupid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could never be with Steven, but she still tried her best to join his company. Was it just for this result?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed at Steven coldly. "Mr. Gellar, let's go to the coffee shop across the street to discuss the dividend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said, "Let's go to my office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "No, you once said that I couldn't come to your company. I entered the lobby today just to get an explanation. You don't allow me to be here, and I also think your company is dirty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up. The last thing I want to hear is your voice. If it weren't for this matter, I wouldn't have talked to you. But that's the fruit of my labor, and I can't give it to you for free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Luna and ordered, "Luna, discuss the matter with them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I want you to discuss it with me in person." Steven's firm voice made Diana stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pointed to the coffee shop across the street. "Okay. Let's go to the coffee shop there. But only you. I don't want to see Ms. Marsh."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana cast an icy glance at Queenie. This time, she escaped the blame again. Emma chose to protect her, so there must be a secret deal between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Queenie glared at Diana provocatively. She was so careful that no one could find fault with her.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned to Evan and said, "Print out a contract."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he followed Diana to the coffee shop across the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie watched them leave with anger, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma noticed it and felt cold all over. Queenie was quite scheming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As there was no one around, she said, "Ms. Marsh, I have agreed to your request. I hope you can keep your promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stopped pretending and glared at her fiercely. "I know you are here for Steven. He is mine. Whoever dares to snatch him from me will pay a heavy price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't stay here any longer. There's a position in my company. I can arrange for you to be a designer there."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="219.html">« Prev</a><a href="221.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
