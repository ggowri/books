"Paige, Diana has always framed Queenie. You always have bad intentions. What do you want to do today? It's a great day for Queenie to start filming. Don't cause trouble. Levi is here, too. He won't tolerate your dirty tricks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige snorted, "Penelope, before slandering us, shouldn&rsquo;t you figure out the father of the baby in your belly? You are eager to stand up for Queenie and create a good persona for her. Do you think everyone will buy your story and see her as a nice, kind-hearted woman and Diana and me as vicious? You must have read too many novels. We have evidence for her wrongdoings. If you aren't afraid that her persona will collapse, feel free to provoke us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are here for dinner. We never expected to run into you. However, you claim that we are going to plot against Queenie. If you're so good at making stuff up, why don't you use that talent to figure out who knocked you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope's eyes suddenly widened with anger, and she roared, "Paige, what nonsense are you talking about? The baby in my belly is Gale's. Although he has gone abroad, you can't bully me like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't bully you. You were the one who rushed to speak for Queenie. How pathetic you are! Instead of flattering others, you should improve yourself and make some achievements."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige felt that her last sentence was completely unnecessary. Someone like Penelope would never understand her warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, Penelope, I'm fine. Diana and Paige didn't do anything. Let's go in and have dinner now." Queenie gently held Penelope's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A head-on confrontation with Diana now would only make Queenie suffer. As long as Steven and Diana were divorced, she would have no worries. But their marriage confined her in every way.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She approached Diana and said, "Diana, what a coincidence! Let's eat together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She reached out to pull Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana intended to step back, but Queenie suddenly fell backwards to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie screamed in pain and stared up at her, tears welling up in her eyes. She said in a choked voice, "Diana, I'm sorry. I kindly invited you to dinner together but never expected you to be unwilling. It's my fault. I know you didn't push me on purpose. I'm okay. You don't have to take it seriously."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was born to be an actress. Given her acting skills, she deserved an Oscar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned and fixed her eyes on her. "Queenie, are you really addicted to acting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Levi walked over and helped Queenie up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the best actor, he was tall and handsome with smooth skin. His eyes were charming. Yet, he was somewhat indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at Diana coldly. "We watched you push Queenie down. How dare you deny it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sneered, "You are all blind. I stepped back. If it had been me, I should have pushed her like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pushed Queenie down violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie shrieked and collapsed to the floor with embarrassment, looking at Diana in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "Queenie, I shoved you down this time. There is a big difference between you falling down by yourself and me pushing you. All the people around you are mentally retarded. I can only prove my innocence with my own actions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's companions were speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sobbed, "Diana, I didn't expect you to shove me violently. I just wanted to invite you to dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm afraid I'll choke to death eating with a bitch like you. I&rsquo;ll leave this opportunity to Levi."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at Paige. "Paige, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Levi glared icily at Diana. "Do I allow you to leave now?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="391.html">« Prev</a><a href="393.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
