Winter nights fell early, often before six.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She stretched, feeling pleasantly refreshed from her nap.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her long hair had tangled around her neck, making her uncomfortable. As she pulled her hair free, the relief was instant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After washing up, she picked up her phone and noticed messages from Althea and Paige.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paige: [Diana, thank you for dinner! It was so extravagant.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Confused, Diana wondered when she had prepared dinner for them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, a thought struck her, and she rushed out of her room, noticing the living room lights were on.</p><p style="text-align:left;">There sat Steven, his tall figure relaxed on the sofa, a laptop open in front of him as he conducted a video meeting.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He exuded an air of focus and intensity, occasionally nodding or offering insightful comments.</p><p style="text-align:left;">People often said that a man engrossed in his work was the most attractive, and Diana had seen Steven like this many times before.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was clear he had genuinely stayed to keep her company.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Not wanting to interrupt, she quietly settled into a different spot on the sofa.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His presence had turned their plans upside down.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Steven noticed she was awake, he wrapped up his meeting and closed the laptop.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He stood and looked over at her. &quot;You&#x27;re awake.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you leave?&quot; she replied, feeling a mix of annoyance and surprise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She hadn&#x27;t wanted to be in the same space as him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It felt suffocating, which was why she needed to step out for fresh air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yet here they were, together again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And Steven had been in her room all day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven gestured toward the dining area, his voice slightly raspy. &quot;Let&#x27;s go eat. I got your favorites, lobster, and steak.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Today had allowed him to enjoy a rare moment of leisure, and being with Diana helped him feel settled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It hadn&#x27;t always been this way, but everything changed when Queenie returned.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly remembering the dinner photos Paige had sent, Diana felt a flutter of excitement for the meal.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A slight smile crept onto her lips as she asked lazily, &quot;So, Mr. Gellar, are you planning to stay here tonight?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven strolled over, taking a relaxed seat. He stretched out his long legs and replied, &quot;Is it odd that I want to stay? Aren&#x27;t we married? Are you trying to kick me out?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His deep voice carried a teasing tone as if he were intentionally reminding her of their relationship.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Frustration bubbled up in Diana at his sudden boldness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She moved closer to the dining table, her eyes widening in surprise at the spread before her. &quot;Finding lobsters this season isn&#x27;t easy.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven raised an eyebrow casually. &quot;If you want them, you can have them anytime.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took her seat, diving straight into the meal, choosing to ignore his comment. She didn&#x27;t believe him anyway.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a glint of determination, she savored the lobster.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven watched her, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth as he relaxed into the moment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana stole a glance at him, noting how rarely she saw him so laid-back.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="802.html">« Prev</a><a href="804.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
