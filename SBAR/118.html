This was Queenie's chess piece in secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would remove Queenie's secret force bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Damn it. Who called the police?" Harry yelled after he realized what was happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A bullet flew past his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was stunned and didn't dare to move. He stared at the policeman at the door, fearing that the bullet would pierce his body at the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The policeman at the door yelled, "Don't move. Put your hands on your head. Squat down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry was scared and didn't dare to move. He squatted on the ground with his head in his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two female police officers came in and untied the ropes on Luna and Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Luna were trembling with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry and several other men looked incredulous. They had done this before. Why were they caught suddenly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were still confused until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ladies, are you okay?" The older female police officer picked up Diana's clothes and put them on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shook her head with tears. "Thank you for arriving on time. If you were one minute slower, I would... I would..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at herself in disgrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't be afraid. We will severely punish these bad guys. Put on your clothes first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The policewoman felt bad when she saw Diana's terrified and tearful face. She thought that the girls would get sick from being frightened if she encountered this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The police came in quickly and arrested several men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry looked at Diana and shouted, "Diana, explain to the police that it was you who asked us to come here. It has nothing to do with us. We did not kidnap you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry shouted excitedly. Queenie said Diana was a fool and could be bullied at will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at him with cold eyes. She asked blankly, "You... What did you say? You kidnapped us and tried to rape us. How could I ask you out when I don't even know who you are? Are you kidding me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry suddenly remembered that he knew Gale, but Diana didn't know him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "What a joke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What I should do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They didn't dare to offend the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They didn't even dare to expose Gale. Now they could only wait for Gale to come and rescue them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Take them away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were taken into a police car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Outside the door, Nolan breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that Diana and Luna were fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nolan walked up to Diana and whispered, "Diana, on the way here, I sent someone to check the surveillance. The surveillance video has been obtained and will be handed over to the police later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana whispered, "Yes! Take them to the police station together. I want these people to spend the rest of their lives in jail. They often do such things and also traffic in children and women. Tell the police later and let them investigate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The man who led the group had a mobile phone, which he threw into the sea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's most trusted minion was Harry. This man did anything for money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay!" Nolan replied in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie claimed to be noble, but he was bad inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A noble man was a man who respected himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was willing to degenerate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After completing the record, Diana and Luna were released.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They reached the roadside and met Gale who was driving a sports car. After getting out of the car, he hurried to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said, "Diana, what happened today was a misunderstanding. Tell the police right away..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana slapped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned, looking at Diana's hateful eyes with guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at her, feeling uncomfortable. "Diana, I just want them to teach you a lesson..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said, "Really? For that vicious woman, you even hurt your own sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You wanted to ruin me and Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, I didn't expect you to be more vicious than Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But don't worry. They won't give you up, because in their eyes, you are nobody."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said, "When you lose your usefulness, all these charges will be placed on you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't worry. Someone wants you to go to the competition. After the competition, Queenie will give you a gift, and you will like it very much.
