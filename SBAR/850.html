How could it be such a coincidence that the surveillance system was broken at that moment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the layout of the surveillance system, then at the port, and then at the man smoking. She couldn't help but say, "The surveillance system went down just when my friend got lost. How could it be such a coincidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was impatient. "Your friend got lost. You can call the police. The surveillance system is broken, as I said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana immediately picked up her phone to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello! I want to report the person in charge of the mall's surveillance room. He teamed up with his friends to kidnap my friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man choked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Diana. "You bitch, are you crazy? Your friend is missing, but what does it have to do with me? How dare you call the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met his gaze and said, "I found that you were the only one in the surveillance room during this period. The surveillance system at other times was normal. But the video of my friend leaving was deleted. Combined with your evasive attitude, who else could it be but you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige wouldn't be that stupid to go out on such a cold day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had searched nearby for her, but she was still nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, it was possible that Paige had been taken away and that the man was an accomplice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Furious, he glared at Diana viciously. "Cancel the report immediately. You are committing a crime by framing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect her to call the police directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was irritated. She picked up the fire extinguisher beside her and sneered, "If anything happens to my friend, no one can escape. I dare to risk my life. How can I be afraid of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man laughed angrily, "You're mad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was getting so anxious that she was about to go crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man spat, "Bitch, you're not afraid of death, but do you think I am? You framed me for kidnapping and called the police to arrest me. When they come to investigate..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think there is no way to recover the surveillance footage you deleted?" Diana interrupted him. He was stunned. He was a newcomer and didn't understand much. Previously, someone gave him 50 thousand dollars and asked him to go out for a while. He didn't know anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, he asked, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana explained, "I mean that the surveillance footage can be restored, but there is no turning back for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that the surveillance video must have been deleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was also aware of what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she called the police. He avoided her gaze, and upon entering, she noticed that he did not know how to operate a computer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a novice, so the person who had deleted the surveillance video must be someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by restoring the video could Diana locate Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already sent a message to Luna. She made a fuss here on purpose to throw the gangsters off their guard.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, the man shook his head and said, "I-I don't know what you are talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "Diana, I have called the manager to come over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't say anything. Why was he here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that she didn't want to talk to him, he walked over and stared at the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frightened by Steven's cold and powerful aura, the arrogant man quickly took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were icy. "Tell me, who has been to the surveillance room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man shook his head vigorously and said in a trembling voice, "I-I don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea who planned all this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was paid 50 thousand dollars, equal to his half-year salary, to delete a video, but he didn't think much about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for what video had been deleted, he was ignorant. Yet, their aggressive expressions suggested someone must have been taken away.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="849.html">« Prev</a><a href="851.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
