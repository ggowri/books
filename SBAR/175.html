She was willful and unrestrained, living life on her own terms. How free she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula left with tears streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had tried to persuade Gale and told him the truth, but he didn't believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would find another way to get the shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The company must not fall into the hands of Jeff and Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The autumn wind was cool. Paula walked against it, feeling quite comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at the bustling streets, she sighed, "Everyone says I'm smart, but in fact, I'm the most confused. Diana, I will avenge you. Jeff doesn't deserve to be your father. Steven doesn't deserve you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tears fell from Paula's eyes. She raised her head, her still beautiful face wearing a confident smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana watched the news until noon and combed through the company's development trends for the next two years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was amazed by Steven's talent. He had a keen eye for every project&mdash;no wonder he had been rising steadily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander was on par with him. Both he and Steven had astonishing business acumen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was terrifyingly strong as well. In the future, Diana would use the convenience of big shots like Steven to make herself a business tycoon on par with Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The first man to give Queenie a taste of success was Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now that Cecil and Queenie had fallen out, she would look for her next target&mdash;Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana also remembered his outcome. She was alive back then and had heard some rumors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she was deep in thought, Alexander called her to invite her to lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She agreed, and then she received a call from Rita.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello, Madam Farley?" Diana asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, Cecil's in trouble." Rita sounded very anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Take it easy, Madam Farley. Please calm down. What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rita said anxiously, "Diana, I can't calm down. Last night, Cecil, as the acting CEO of the branch, went to a bar to discuss business and was framed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned, "Framed? What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rita whispered, "Drugs. I checked. The bar is under Steven's name. In just one month, our company secrets have been leaked, and we've been robbed of three projects. Diana, you were right. Queenie is really capable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was grateful that she had always believed in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Madam Farley, I can only warn you to be careful with her. She's hiding a company in the dark, but I've never been able to find out which one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Next up was the Foliot family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rita's voice turned cold. "It might not be just one company. The ones that have robbed our company of cooperation projects are three different companies. I checked. The person in charge is not Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana walked to the floor-to-ceiling window and looked at the view outside, her gaze distant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie wouldn't let Steven know about the company she had established.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By the time Steven found out, she would already be very successful. However, at that time, Steven would not suspect anything. He would instead admire Queenie's capabilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you know Steven. Can you help Cecil? He can't afford a criminal record. He's going to inherit the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Saying this, Rita fell silent. She realized their goal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were trying to get Cecil a criminal record so he couldn't inherit the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana also thought of this. "Madam Farley, where is Cecil's branch located?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="174.html">« Prev</a><a href="176.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
