In her previous life, around this time, Paula had already developed dementia. After hitting someone, she was sent to a mental hospital and only brought back months later by Eric.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's situation had changed this time, but the issue with Queenie's biological mother had not.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Alexander went over together and saw that Queenie's mother's face was already swollen from a slap by Paula.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was hiding behind Jeff, glaring at Paula but not daring to say a word.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff stood in front of her, blocking her from Paula's view. He explained, "Paula, don't misunderstand. She just came to apologize for what happened last time. Nothing is going on between us. You've already slapped her and yelled at her, so let's just leave it at that."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula sneered, casting a sharp glance at him. "Jeff, how can I just leave it? Last time, I caught you two in bed, and now, today, you're drinking together again. You say there's nothing between you? Tell me, does anyone here actually believe that?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was loud as she intentionally made a scene.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted everyone to see what kind of man Jeff really was.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was forcing that woman to come forward and pushing Jeff to ask for a divorce.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had already gathered enough evidence to leave him penniless when the time came.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff loved money more than life. Without money, he would be as good as dead. Without it, he couldn't survive with his mistress.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without money, Jeff would be crushed by his relatives.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For years, Paula had worked hard to support this family of ingrates.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one appreciated her effort. They only plotted against her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recently, she had cut off a few of his relatives' business deals. Soon, it would cause a big scene, and Jeff would have to deal with it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to see how there could be love without money.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was anxious. He had no idea Amelie would show up today.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't seen Amelie in days because he was feeling insecure about his performance. He wanted to see if being with her would make him feel better, but he never expected to run into this mess tonight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had already suspected him, and now, being caught twice, he knew his marriage with her was at its end.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed like he needed to speed up his plan.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled and said, "Paula, I'm sorry. This is just a misunderstanding. With so many people here, it's hard to avoid running into someone. She's at this event, and we can't just offend people, you know? I promise I'll stay away from other women from now on. I know you don't like it when I stand near them. These past years, I've behaved myself because I was always afraid of making you upset. I didn't even dare talk to other women."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, he made Paula seem like a jealous woman.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff's ability to shift blame was truly top-notch.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="328.html">« Prev</a><a href="330.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
