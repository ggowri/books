If it weren&#x27;t for Cecil and Madam Farley proving my innocence, I&#x27;d still be there. Mark claimed that you and I framed Amelie for having an affair with him, and that I came after you to get revenge when the plan failed.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily forced a bitter smile, tears in her eyes. &quot;I can&#x27;t believe they would stoop this low. I&#x27;m so sorry. I never thought you&#x27;d be pulled into this mess. All my information came from Paula.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But I didn&#x27;t know why she didn&#x27;t come forward to defend you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana replied, shaking her head, &quot;Even if she tried, it wouldn&#x27;t help. Her company has gone under. No one&#x27;s going to take her word.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was never concerned with Paula. Those she had cut ties with were no longer worth her attention.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, have you been watching over my daughter?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily had been worried about her daughter being hurt.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana raised an eyebrow and looked her in the eye. &quot;Mrs. Foliot, do you really think your daughter likes you? She&#x27;s the one who reported me to the police, claiming I was the one who killed you. And she didn&#x27;t even come see you once. She&#x27;s more interested in...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana stopped, thinking better of it. Given Lily&#x27;s fragile state, this wasn&#x27;t the time to reveal everything.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily&#x27;s face went pale, her lips trembling as silent tears fell. &quot;She resents me because I&#x27;m strict. But no matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t get her to do it right.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;She always goes against me. I told her not to go to bars. It&#x27;s only asking for trouble. But she thinks those are the places young people belong.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily looked utterly defeated. She knew her children resented her strict approach, but she feared that if she didn&#x27;t keep them in line, they&#x27;d go astray.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Raising her children had drained her, and she hadn&#x27;t even noticed her husband&#x27;s affair, which had lasted over a decade.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And the moment his infidelity was exposed, Mark had nearly tried to kill her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana took a steadying breath and said, &quot;Mrs. Foliot, give me a moment.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took out her phone and called Luna. &quot;Luna, I need you to find out where Amelie is.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;On it!&quot; Luna replied without hesitation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">...</p><p style="text-align:left;">Last night, Amelie had pacified Jeff by promising him wealth. She&#x27;d assured him that she&#x27;d get into the Foliot family&#x27;s good graces and that he&#x27;d soon be living the life of a rich man.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This afternoon, she had taken Jean out shopping, as part of her plan to win favor with the Foliot family and secure her place.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As long as she kept Jean happy, Mark would be pleased, and she could access his fortune.</p><p style="text-align:left;">...</p><p style="text-align:left;">After half an hour, Diana received Luna&#x27;s update.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She turned to Lily. &quot;Mrs. Foliot, do you want to know why you and your daughter can&#x27;t see eye to eye? Someone&#x27;s been working hard to drive a wedge between you two. Now that you can move around, how about I take you out for some fresh air and you can see for yourself why your daughter resents you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only by seeing the truth and accepting reality would Lily believe what she was saying.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A shiver of dread ran through her. She feared what her carefully raised child might be capable of.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But after coming so close to death, she felt ready to face the truth, no matter how painful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She nodded firmly. &quot;Yes. Let&#x27;s go.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana helped her bundle up with warm clothes, a scarf, mask, and hat, then fetched a wheelchair and helped Lily downstairs, where Luna was waiting.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Together, Luna and Diana settled Lily in the car, with Diana sitting beside her as Luna drove toward the city&#x27;s main mall.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the underground parking lot, Diana turned to Lily. &quot;Your daughter and Amelie are here, shopping. Let&#x27;s go see.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily&#x27;s face was filled with despair as she looked at Diana. &quot;Diana, I...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Madam, we can&#x27;t keep living in denial. How long can we hide behind well-meaning lies? Fooling ourselves doesn&#x27;t bring happiness that lasts.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">In this second chance at life, Diana had decided not to hide that she&#x27;d saved Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the past, she had done good in silence, but if no one acknowledged it, why not own it proudly?</p><p style="text-align:left;">There was nothing ashamed to admit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had nothing to be ashamed of.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In this lifetime, she wouldn&#x27;t keep her good deeds to herself anymore.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily&#x27;s tears flowed freely. She&#x27;d still wanted to believe her daughter wouldn&#x27;t stoop to associating with a mistress. But reality was often a harsh wake-up call.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="808.html">« Prev</a><a href="810.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
