He had already regarded Diana as his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cell phone kept vibrating. Queenie kept calling him, but he ignored her and turned his phone to silent mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pried Cecil's hands open with force. Cecil moved but did not open his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glared at Cecil coldly, picked up Diana, put her on the sofa beside him, put her head on his knees, took a blanket and covered her with it so that she could sleep more comfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned over comfortably, subconsciously hugged Steven's waist with both hands, and continued to sleep soundly, unaware of her current situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the early hours of the morning, she slept deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She obviously regarded Steven as a heater.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was slightly stunned. Diana's soft hand holding his waist. The touch made his whole body tense. He could even hear his own wildly beating heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a feeling he had never had before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked down at Diana with some disbelief. She was sleeping very soundly and seemed to be tired, but he liked this feeling. Holding her in his arms, he felt satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After secretly sleeping with her twice, he discovered that she slept deeply at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would just kick the quilt and turn over occasionally, as if she had no feeling at all about anything around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shook his head slightly. A fool like her wouldn't even know that her things were stolen in the middle of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, who was always indifferent, had a cold look in his eyes that gradually changed, and became a little doting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana woke up. It was already seven o'clock in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her eyes and saw Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was shocked. He and she...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat up quickly, only to find that she had moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her movements, Steven woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was shocked and asked, "Why am I sleeping here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her with disdain, and his tone became colder. "Then where do you want to sleep? Cecil's bed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat down and rubbed her sore shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't sleep well that night and felt like she was sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was sleeping over there. You brought me here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at Steven and didn't appreciate it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he said in a husky voice, "Let's go. It's time to go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Cecil. He was still sleeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "You go back first. I'll leave later."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't want to be in the same car with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had an important meeting this morning. His father's illegitimate sons had been picking on him again recently, so he had to go to the company today.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Cecil won't be scared in daylight. You don't need to stay here all the time." He looked arrogant, and his eyes were cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that Steven was angry again, but she didn't want to ride in the same car with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed angrily. "Mr. Gellar, everyone knows that you are decisive and efficient in doing things, and you are also good at observing people's expressions. Don't you see that? I don't want to go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to stay and accompany Cecil?" Steven said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled mischievously. "Mr. Gellar, why are you so dirty in your mind? There's nothing going on between Cecil and me. I treat him like a younger brother. You think about these things all the time. Can't you keep your peace?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was stunned. He seemed to have said the same thing to Diana a year ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="670.html">« Prev</a><a href="672.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
