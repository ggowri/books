Diana liked Helen because of how wise and understanding she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Diana divorced, Helen still supported her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen knew her struggles and was aware of how disappointing Steven was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said softly, "Grandma, you used to say these things to me, and I didn't listen. Now I understand. I should only care for myself and the people I truly value."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen laughed heartily, "I'm glad to hear that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You used to worry too much about others. When people bullied you, you endured it silently. But didn't these past two years teach you? It's better to stand up and fight back than to suffer in silence. That way, they won't dare bully you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Grandma, I've remembered all your advice. It's been a long time since I let anyone bully me easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good." Helen turned toward the kitchen and called out, "Candice, bring a bowl of bird's nest for Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Candice replied cheerfully from the kitchen, "Right away, Madam Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen pulled Diana to sit on the sofa beside her, ignoring Steven entirely. She could tell that Diana would never forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People only realized what they had lost after it was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt helpless and sat down to listen to their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I saw you in the designer competition a few days ago," Helen said proudly. "You're good at everything you do. You're amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled shyly, "I was just doodling. By the way, I bought a gift for you. It's warm clothes I designed. The weather is cold, and these will keep you cozy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was excited. "Diana, you sent me some last month, and they're wonderful&mdash;so soft and warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are tailored to old people like me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "These are for you to wear during the cold days. When spring comes, I'll design some dresses for you. You'll look very graceful in them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen laughed, looking at her dress. "All my clothes are designed by you. Each piece is comfortable to wear. I liked them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to wear dresses when I was young. I was a stunner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love them. I've worn them my whole life, but your designs are my favorite. They're stylish yet dignified. My old friends adore them too. Now that you're no longer busy taking care of Steven, can you design some for them? They've been waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I'll go meet them after Christmas," Diana agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen clapped her hands in delight. "That will make them so happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Candice soon brought over a bowl of bird's nest. Helen handed it to Diana. "Eat this first. Lunch will have all your favorite dishes&mdash;crab, seafood, and salmon. I had the freshest ingredients flown in just for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was touched. "Thank you, Grandma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rested her head on Helen's shoulder, and Helen gently patted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching their interaction, Steven felt a pang of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen Helen so happy, except when Diana was around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only knew now that all these years, the clothes Helen wore were designed by Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to admit that Diana could design any type of clothing beautifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, make sure you eat all the bird's nest," Helen said. "You can take the rest home to enjoy later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Grandma," Diana replied gratefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a spoon of the bird's nest, and it was very good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and finished it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen stood up. "I need to make a phone call upstairs. Stay here and talk with Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana offered, "Let me help you upstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. I can manage," Helen said, waving her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she was trying to give Diana and Steven the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want Diana to leave, but she respected Diana's choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Steven and Diana were left in the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana did not feel awkward. She took out her phone and started watching videos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found a very funny video and was laughing happily. Suddenly, a shadow fell beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar scent came, and her smile faded a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Steven and found his expression strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Is there not enough space over there? Why are you crowding me here?" Diana asked, annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven asked, "Diana, do you really have no feelings for me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Diana answered firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven paused, not knowing how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "In a few months, our relationship will be over. I will keep my promise, and I ask you to keep yours. Let's go to get the divorce certificate without any trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt a sharp pain in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Alright. Then during the time we are still married, I demand that you fulfill your duties as a wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned and quickly moved away. "Steven, you already have Queenie. I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore. Someone like you won't lack women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you just leave me alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes. "Other women? Do you want to push me to other women? Diana, I am your husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it! I've explained this to you countless times. I don't want to explain it again. It was all my one-sided love, and now I don't want to love you anymore. You can find whoever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was not happy. She was very traditional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Leopold always joked about finding handsome men for her, she never did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Steven grabbed her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana jumped and asked warily, "Steven, get your hands off me. What do you want?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="884.html">« Prev</a><a href="886.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
