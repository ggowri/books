Considering how they used to misunderstand her, it was true they would never have believed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing his silence, Diana understood everything. She had told them before that she was a doctor, a designer, even a racecar driver. They didn&#x27;t believe her. They had only laughed, mocking her dreams as unrealistic and delusional.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She smiled faintly and said nothing. Lowering her head, she went back to her phone. At least scrolling helped lighten her mood.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven pressed his lips tightly together, a sharp pang in his chest. He had been so busy before. Every time he saw Diana, she was tangled in some argument with Queenie. He hadn&#x27;t had the patience to uncover the truth. Instead, he chose to trust others&#x27; words, brushing aside Diana&#x27;s feelings.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had never stood by her side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sam could send his sister to prison for the sake of his wife. Yet for Diana, Steven hadn&#x27;t done a single thing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The more he thought about it, the more furious he became, mostly with himself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The room fell into silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna and Evan exchanged glances.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan, who already had feelings for Luna, now admired her even more for risking her life to save him. His gaze softened as he looked at her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Feeling flustered under his stare, Luna simply closed her eyes, pretending to sleep.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Back in another ward, Queenie returned to see Zion already there. Her expression darkened. She thought, &quot;What is he doing here again?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She forced a weak smile despite her pale face. &quot;Mr. Swift, you&#x27;re here.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion studied her frail state, frowning in concern. &quot;What happened to you, Queenie? I&#x27;ve got a new movie lined up for you. The shoot&#x27;s three months long. You need to recover quickly. You&#x27;re getting quite popular, and the company is committed to promoting you. Get better soon. Trust me, you&#x27;ll be a star.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion had fought hard to sign her, banking on her connection with Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He believed with Steven&#x27;s influence, his own career prospects would be bright.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Queenie failed to rise to stardom, she&#x27;d have no choice but to follow his arrangements and have a life worse than death. She was young and vibrant, a commodity that could fetch a high price.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And where&#x27;s Mr. Gellar? Isn&#x27;t he here to take care of you? Reporters already know you&#x27;re hospitalized. They&#x27;re all waiting outside the hospital, but this place won&#x27;t let them in. If we could get footage of Steven by your side, it&#x27;d be a great story. Perfect for another PR boost.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Right now, Diana&#x27;s rescue story is overshadowing you. We need fresh headlines.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing Diana&#x27;s name, Queenie felt her body tense. It was Diana again; Queenie felt she couldn&#x27;t get rid of that name no matter where she went.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;Once, I may have been Diana&#x27;s nightmare. How has the tables turned? Now, it feels like Diana is haunting me instead.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She forced a smile. &quot;Mr. Gellar is looking after Evan. My parents are here for me, so he&#x27;s with him. Evan doesn&#x27;t have anyone else.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion chuckled lightly. &quot;What a compassionate boss Mr. Gellar is.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie could see through him. She realized that Zion had signed her only because of Steven&#x27;s power.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Could I not escape Steven&#x27;s shadow and live on my own?&quot; she thought.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This had always been her dream. She believed that someday, through her own efforts, she could stand where she wanted to be.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She believed she didn&#x27;t need Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, rest and recover. I won&#x27;t disturb you. I&#x27;ve already sent your assistant all the work details.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He didn&#x27;t want to linger at the hospital. There was too much to do.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Thank you for visiting me, Mr. Swift. Once I recover, Steven and I will treat you to dinner.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">That was what Zion wanted to hear most. He nodded in satisfaction. &quot;Take care of yourself first.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Zion gave her a deep look and turned to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was sensitive and suddenly felt that Zion&#x27;s look was dangerous.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie sensed the threat, her instincts kicking in. She inhaled deeply and lay back down. When the nurse came in to set up her IV drip, she quickly sent a message to Felicity. She wanted Diana&#x27;s trending topic removed and her own recent award pushed to the top.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only after hitting send did she allow the nurse to proceed with the IV.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That afternoon, Luna, Evan, and Paige were discharged from the hospital.</p><p>Carolyn&#x27;s husband, Sam, came to take her home.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven pulled his car up to the curb, looking at Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His tone was firm. &quot;Get in. We&#x27;re visiting my grandmother tomorrow.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt exasperated.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His calm demeanor made it clear he was being deliberate.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had planned to visit his grandmother before Christmas anyway.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana and Luna got into the car.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After all, with Christmas approaching, she didn&#x27;t want Steven to make trouble for her brother.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That could wait until after the holiday.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Evan also climbed into the car, Steven allowed a faint smile. The four of them headed back to the villa.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario watched from downstairs as Steven left with Diana and the others, frowning. He knew Queenie&#x27;s brother should be back, and Queenie had messed everything up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He took dinner to Queenie&#x27;s ward.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Back at home, Diana prepared dinner for Steven, Luna, and Evan.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She worked quickly. Forty minutes later, a hearty meal was laid out on the table.</p><p style="text-align:left;">During dinner, Steven ate far more than usual. He disliked dining out, but Diana&#x27;s cooking always had him going back for seconds.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan watched Steven eat in astonishment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna, having spent an entire day and night in the hospital, was exhausted. She finished her meal quickly and turned to Diana. &quot;I&#x27;m so tired. I&#x27;m heading to bed. You didn&#x27;t sleep last night either. Get some rest soon.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled and nodded. &quot;Sure. Don&#x27;t forget to take your medicine, both of you. I&#x27;ve already set it out for you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan chimed in, &quot;Thanks. Luna and I will be heading out then.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana replied, &quot;Alright.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan grinned again. &quot;Ms. Bishop, I&#x27;ll take good care of Luna. She&#x27;s my savior. Without her, I wouldn&#x27;t be here. She&#x27;s the one for me, no question.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana raised an eyebrow, amused. &quot;Oh? So, are you planning to marry her out of gratitude?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan froze, then chuckled, glancing at Luna. The truth was, he did want to.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna glared at him. &quot;What nonsense are you spouting? Aren&#x27;t we leaving?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan instantly straightened up, all obedience. &quot;Right, right. Let&#x27;s go. It&#x27;s cold outside. Put your hat on.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His steps were still unsteady, his body weak.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leaning on Luna for support, he quickly led her out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Upon watching them leave, Diana smiled. She felt Evan seemed like a good match.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She felt at ease entrusting Luna to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her past life, Evan had been one of the few who lived with clarity. She hadn&#x27;t seen his story to the end, but she felt it was a happy one.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana stood, glancing at Steven. &quot;I&#x27;ll do the dishes.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven, noticing her tired expression, took the plates from her hands. &quot;I&#x27;ll wash them. You should rest.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at him, surprised. &quot;You? Do dishes?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven frowned, feeling underestimated.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s just dishes. I can handle it. Go on and rest.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was too tired to argue. &quot;Alright. Thanks.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="878.html">« Prev</a><a href="880.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
