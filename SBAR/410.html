I just guessed you would be here. You once said you would take me on an island vacation. I still remember, after I came back last year, you specifically bought an island just to go on vacation with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But the scenery here is truly beautiful. Under the sunset, the water shimmers. We need a scene with the sunset the day after tomorrow, and I think this place would be perfect," she added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, feeling that he had been such a fool at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said indifferently, "I'll take you there next time. I have to go back now. If you like the scenery here, feel free to stay a few more days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie looked around and saw that there wasn't even a proper place to stay on the deserted island. Steven was still telling her to stay for a few more days, which made her face turn pale. She felt that Steven didn't care about her at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He really had utterly changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled very unnaturally, almost dropping her gentle facade. "Steven, are you joking with me? I came here to find you. Without you by my side, I feel empty inside. Seeing you makes me feel at ease."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's tone was very gentle, her white dress fluttering in the wind, coupled with a look of grievance, making her appear pitiful and delicate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, whenever she showed such an expression, Steven would always give in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil and Paige, seeing the deliberate gentleness Queenie was putting on, felt extremely awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were incredulous that Steven could not see through her obvious pretense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige said, "This must be what they mean when they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to think that Frank was the most handsome. After she stopped being so infatuated, she found him particularly disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige turned her head and looked at Diana sympathetically, "Diana, I finally understand why you didn't win."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil said dully, "Because Diana is not as good at pretending as that woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing Cecil's words, Queenie looked at him with a sense of grievance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Farley..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil felt like puking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's actions were extremely insulting, causing Queenie to tremble all over. Her expression was a shock; clearly, she had not expected Cecil to insult her so blatantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cecil..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being framed by Queenie several times, Cecil developed trauma. Looking at the captain, he said, "Here comes the witch, Captain. Hurry up and set sail."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie glared at him; now, she realized she had gained a new nickname.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was amused by Cecil's antics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that Queenie's previous schemes had left him with a lasting nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the captain steered the ship away, facing the setting sun, Diana gazed at the beautiful scenery before her and smiled, a smile of unparalleled charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven raised his eyes, only to be caught in that unparalleled charm, losing himself in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie followed her gaze and saw Diana; the beautiful sunset was outshone by that one smile of unparalleled charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie looked at Steven's deep and gentle gaze, feeling both angry and jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Steven in disbelief; he carried the imposing aura of someone in power, yet his gaze was filled with deep affection for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's departure truly changed him a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What one could have was often seen as the best. Only after losing something did a person realize its value.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana also came to understand this principle. Before, she had kept Steven hanging because she knew that what one cannot have is often seen as the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's change terrified Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie touched her stomach, looking unwell; she was feeling uncomfortable in her stomach. "Steven, I haven't had dinner yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She deliberately didn't eat to make Steven care about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked down at her, his voice cold, "There's no restaurant here. Go back and have your meal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, he boarded the boat with graceful steps, and Evan quickly followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, so angry that tears welled up in her eyes, had no choice but to follow him onto the boat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Diana's boat leave, she felt angry, having thought they would spend the night here. In the middle of the night, she could have made Diana fall into the sea without him noticing. This kind of death would make Diana suffer more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just as she arrived, Diana's boat left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, can you keep me company tonight when we get back?" Queenie walked over and stood beside Steven.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="409.html">« Prev</a><a href="411.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
