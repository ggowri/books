She thought, "Whatever he meant, at least I managed to keep my dignity intact."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Steven leave, she quickly jumped out of bed and locked the door from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Steven heard her lock the door and couldn't help but smile faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana seemed to have forgotten that this was his villa, and every door had a spare key. She couldn't truly lock him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven returned to his room next door to shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana also headed to the bathroom to freshen up and prepare for sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no intention of seeing Steven again tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back on the events of the night, she couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Paula's retaliation was truly impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie spent her entire life wanting to be a wealthy, respectable wife. Now, after tonight's fiasco, everyone knows her as a mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Queenie, who hates being labeled as an illegitimate child, is publicly shamed as one.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's tactics are indeed skillful, but I do worry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Amelie are both extremely vengeful people."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pondering this, Diana picked up her phone, intending to warn Lily to be cautious around Amelie and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had been exposed as well, and that made Lily's situation dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, the Foliot family hadn't intervened in these affairs, or at least not in a way she could see.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her phone, only to realize she didn't have Lily's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left with no other option, she decided to wait and see what would happen tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After showering, she blow-dried her hair and sat at her vanity to carefully apply her skincare routine. Once finished, she got up and prepared for bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying down, she absentmindedly touched her lips, still slightly swollen and tense from Steven's rough kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a surge of anger. She thought, "How dare Steven use lips that have kissed another woman to kiss me? There won't be a next time. I won't let him catch me off guard again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Diana rubbed her lips hard, trying to erase the feeling, then settled into bed, ready to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her phone, resting on the bedside table, vibrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Picking it up, she saw a message that made her frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message was from Queenie : [Diana, was tonight your doing? You wretched woman, you'll die a miserable death!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was momentarily stunned. She thought, "Queenie's gotten so used to throwing mud at others, hasn't she?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just a spectator, and now she's accusing me of plotting against her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Diana called Queenie directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you dare call me? Was tonight your scheme?" Queenie's voice was trembling with rage and barely concealed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana found it almost laughable. "Queenie, you're so used to slinging mud at others that your first reaction is to blame me. Did I make your mother do what she did? Is your reputation for sleeping around just a lie?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you've never once owned up to your actions. You always shift the blame to someone else. You stole my life, and you lived it well. But to give your mother a proper status, you ruined everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't expect her to appreciate it. Your mother is just as selfish and self-centered as you are. And your father is the same. The three of you are well-suited for each other. A family of self-centered, greedy people.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You succeeded in driving me away. You could have easily married Steven after that. Those four foolish brothers would've continued to dote on you, and Paula would've handed everything over to you. But look at where you are now. Didn't you create this mess yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've gotten so used to blaming me for everything. Is that all you're good for, Queenie?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="661.html">« Prev</a><a href="663.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
