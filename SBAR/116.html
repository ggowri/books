And Diana's gaze was sharp and cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man in the lead was very young. Diana knew him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were Gale's secret goons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't go back to apologize to Queenie, so Gale sent someone to deal with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, right?" The man asked Diana with a smile, looking her up and down with evil eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hated his look. The reason she knew this man was that he was Gale's man and was secretly colluding with Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was also the man who would hit her car in the future and try to kill her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In other words, this man was Queenie's pursuer.He loved Queenie very much that he would do anything for her.  </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana replied calmly, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh! Someone paid me to teach you a lesson. Do you want to go with us on your own or do you want us to take you away by force?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said, "Did Gale ask you to come?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The five men were stunned and curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana glanced at Luna and whispered, "I want to send them to jail. I'll pretend to be caught."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna immediately understood what Diana meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pressed the side button of her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nolan received the news quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man went forward to pull Diana away. Diana waved her hands in fear, quickly stepped back, and shouted, "Go away. Don't touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone heard Diana's frightened and loud voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The men were stunned. And the only sound in the silence was their breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They seemed to freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry reacted and smiled, "Diana, I haven't even touched you yet. Why are you so scared?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You... Don't come over here. What do you want to do? Kidnap me?" Diana kept backing away, looking scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Damn girl, I haven't done anything to you yet. Why do you look so scared?" Harry looked at Diana's face and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had a perfect face and figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry thought, "How could Gale bear to bully her? If I had a sister like this, I would love her dearly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was frightened. She looked at the few people with vigilance in her eyes. Her expression was unclear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She trembled slightly, as if she was very scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Beautiful and weak, she successfully aroused the desires of the men. There seemed to be fire burning in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry grabbed Diana's hand fiercely and looked at her. "Diana, you'd better behave yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana struggled hard. "Let me go. Don't touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her beautiful eyes glowed coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her terrified voice was seductive and bewitching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The hearts of the men trembled. And they were aroused with desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They became sexually aroused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other men couldn't hold back any longer, so they rushed forward together and took Luna and Diana away together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The alley returned to peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After calling the police, Nolan quickly took the police to follow the location to rescue Diana and Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the beach, in a warehouse, Luna and Diana were tied up hand and foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry called Gale in front of Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said, "Hey! Gale, I caught her. She's very beautiful. My men like her very much. Why not let them have fun with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was furious. "Harry, what are you talking about? I just asked you to teach her a lesson. She is my biological sister! Do you dare rape her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well, we have to teach her a profound lesson so that she will remember it and won't plot against you next time. Have you forgotten the last time she plotted against you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was speechless. And he turned pale as he watched the racing cars speeding past on the track.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His voice trembled slightly. "No, it's too cruel to her. Although I hate her very much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, what if she plots against you again next time? If you don't teach her a lesson, she won't learn and will plot against you again next time," Harry said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale held the phone in his hand tightly.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="115.html">« Prev</a><a href="117.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
