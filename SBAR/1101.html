The wind was strong last night. We can take them home and make seafood."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want crab, then we</span><span>'</span><span>ll make crab."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana noticed there were plenty of coconut trees on the island. The old coconuts had fallen to the ground, some already starting to sprout.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could easily kick a coconut lying on the ground at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly composed himself. He had never lost control like this before. He rarely ever shed a tear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I'll take you," he said, his voice hoarse but steady.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this moment, she felt more optimistic than Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When you're dead, you have nothing. But as long as you're alive, there's hope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took her hand and led her toward the coconut grove not far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His love for Diana grew clearer, deeper with every passing moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only now he realized that from the moment that lively, innocent girl burst into his life, she had already taken over his world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every corner of Steven's world was filled with her presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana gently. She smiled, her mood seemingly light and cheerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, you seem to be in a good mood."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and laughed. "Yeah, I</span><span>'</span><span>m in a great mood. Watching you cry almost killed me with laughter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was definitely going to keep this embarrassing side of him in her memory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears still streaked his face as he gave her a cold warning, "Diana, forget what just happened. Just remember how good I</span><span>'</span><span>ve been to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed. "The first time you ever cried in your life, and it was in front of me. Trust me, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll never forget you for this&mdash;it</span><span>'</span><span>s burned into my memory."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And honestly, aside from giving me your company, you</span><span>'</span><span>ve never really been good to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven found himself unable to say what he had originally planned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling awkward, he lightly scratched her palm with his finger, as if punishing her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a tickle and glanced down at their intertwined hands. It felt warm. For the first time in all these years by his side, she felt a sense of peace she had never known.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked up and met Steven's gaze. He had returned to his usual lofty demeanor, his eyes deep and unreadable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly looked away. She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t afford to give Steven any hope right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Steven, let</span><span>'</span><span>s think about it differently. If I hurt you the way you hurt me, would you forgive me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The question left Steven silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He answered firmly, "No, I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana paused for a moment, slightly surprised. "So, you</span><span>'</span><span>re not as indifferent as you seem."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven froze for a moment, then held her hand tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cut him off, "Don</span><span>'</span><span>t talk to me about the future, and don</span><span>'</span><span>t you dare apologize. If you can</span><span>'</span><span>t do it yourself, don</span><span>'</span><span>t expect me to."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had nothing to say and lowered his head in defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's mood lifted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She kicked a decent-looking coconut, picked it up, and dropped it into the basket Steven was carrying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly filled a basket with coconuts. Steven struggled to carry them back home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana followed behind him, her eyes on the distant sea. The water looked cold now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were summer, she</span><span>'</span><span>d already be itching to dive in and fish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Steven, wait for me. I</span><span>'</span><span>m gonna check the water. If it</span><span>'</span><span>s not too cold, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll catch a few fish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven grabbed her hand and said, "No way. It</span><span>'</span><span>s freezing up here, the water</span><span>'</span><span>s gotta be worse. We</span><span>'</span><span>ve got fish at home. I bought four this morning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Alright then. I don</span><span>'</span><span>t want to catch a cold either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven let out a sigh of relief when he heard her say that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, having Diana in this world made his life so much better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything he had worked so hard for would one day be hers. It only mattered if she was there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anywhere without her, Steven just wanted to run away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the first half of his life, he had hurt Diana deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the second half, no matter what, he just wanted to protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at the villa, Diana headed to the kitchen to deal with the seafood. She opened the fridge and found it packed with seafood. Surprised, she turned to Steven and asked, "How long are you planning to stay here? This is enough seafood for two weeks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m planning to stay for two weeks before heading back. Your construction site will probably start in about two weeks. By then, Queenie will definitely make her move. We</span><span>'</span><span>ve got two weeks. Two weeks with no one to bother us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to go fishing, it</span><span>'</span><span>ll be sunny in three days. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll go with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed and asked, "What about the company?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over, bent down, and met her gaze. "Don</span><span>'</span><span>t worry. I</span><span>'</span><span>ve taken care of everything at the company. No one</span><span>'</span><span>s going to bother us during this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana realized he just wanted to spend some alone time with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She decided to treat it as a two-week vacation for herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had made up his mind. If she tried to leave, they</span><span>'</span><span>d just end up arguing again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana decided to just enjoy life for now!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana grabbed a fish and a lobster, then started cleaning them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stayed by her side, helping her prepare lunch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Diana cook was actually quite a delight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She did everything with such focus, calm and precision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie woke up to a call from the police station.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George wanted to see her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn</span><span>'</span><span>t refuse. She would go and say goodbye for the last time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After lunch, she dressed herself up, wearing a pink suit, and went to see George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the visiting room, George looked disheveled, his eyes cold as he stared at the beautiful Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie frowned and asked, "Why do you want to see me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George let out a cold laugh. "Queenie, I never thought you'd use me too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie forced a smile. "George, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve helped you for over a decade. When you started dating Yvette, you should</span><span>'</span><span>ve known this day would come."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her smile was eerie and cold, no longer carrying the innocence it once had.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George froze for a moment, then sneered. "So, you knew all along. She was nothing but a toy to me. The one I truly admire is Diana&mdash;the clever, resilient Diana you always described."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, I never loved you either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George knew exactly how to break Queenie's heart.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1100.html">« Prev</a><a href="1102.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
