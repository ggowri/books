I have figured it out now. No matter what I say, you will not believe it, nor will you listen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've told you before that Penelope is not a good person. She goes to nightclubs and is with different men. If you want to raise her child, I don't care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was young once, and I know how important she is to you. Keep her outside and not let me see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You like your father and Queenie so much. Go find them, please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale said, "Mom, I didn't mean that. I just couldn't believe that my father whom I respected so much and my sister whom I loved so much would treat me like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't believe me, forget it. I have things to do at the company and don't have time." Paula hung up the phone and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale collapsed on the bed. Now even his mother didn't believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He closed his eyes in pain. As a man with disabled legs, he was confused and afraid about his future life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The operation lasted a full eight hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In recent years, she would also come to perform surgery on special patients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the operation, Tom asked nervously, "Diana, are you tired? Let's go have dinner first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't ask whether it would succeed or not. With her help, it would definitely succeed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took off her mask, her face full of fatigue. She leaned against the wall and asked with a smile, "Why didn't you ask me whether the operation was successful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom smiled elegantly, "Diana, I have always trusted your medical skills. My mentor has always admired yours, and I have always admired you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled proudly and said in a playful tone, "In fact, you can also do this operation, but the other party is your cousin. And you are too worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. The operation was successful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom finally smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, thank you so much. Go change your clothes and come over for dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom was very excited and immediately called his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana changed her clothes, had dinner with Tom, and then left the hospital. Tobias came to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She returned home and fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Olivia couldn't say a word to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana woke up, it was already the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dazzling sunlight shone in through the window. She opened her eyes suddenly and saw the familiar room. She was stunned for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana slept for too long and felt limp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't even have any dreams that night. And she hadn't slept so soundly for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since her rebirth, she would occasionally dream about things from her previous life and wake up in the middle of the night feeling sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. She slept well might because of what happened to Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She got out of bed and called Tom first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom sounded cheerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tom, how is your cousin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood at the window and saw Olivia running in the garden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom said, "Diana, he's recovering well. I have been taking care of him. Don't worry. Just have a good rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hanging up the phone, she washed up and went downstairs. Leopold was not at home and might have gone out to walk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She went out to look for Olivia, who had just come back, sweating profusely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Diana, Olivia ran over and asked breathlessly, "Diana, why did you sleep until noon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at her with a smile. "Didn't you sleep until now and then get up to run?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia smiled, "You know I always go to bed late. When I'm on a mission, I may not sleep all night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia looked at Diana and suddenly said, "Diana, you are much less aggressive now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled calmly, "Maybe it's because I saved someone yesterday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia reached out and touched Diana's head. Her technique was strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, do more good deeds in the future, and you will be happy." Olivia smiled at Diana. Her clear eyes could expose all sins.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="235.html">« Prev</a><a href="237.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
