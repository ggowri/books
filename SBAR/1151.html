Seeing the strange looks from those around her, she felt extremely embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her heart ached deeply. During the days when Steven protected her, she had never been so humiliated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Steven wished she would just die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's previous kindness to Queenie was all fake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now he's framing her again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of the past, she couldn't help but shed tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was heartless to her, but Queenie gradually developed uncontrollable feelings for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just wanted to be with her mom and dad, she just wanted to work hard. She was innocent too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tearful look was captivating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, if Queenie was upset, Steven would always give her gifts to cheer her up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Steven looks at her with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tenderness was all given to Diana, whom Queenie hated the most.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had always been the one bullying others; she had never been bullied like this before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially being bullied by Steven, it made her feel worse than death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie kept shedding tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven pitifully and said, "Steven, we were so in love before. You even abandoned your newlywed wife for me. Now you're humiliating me in front of everyone. Steven, how can you treat me like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had no one left to rely on. Deep down, she knew that the only person she could depend on in this world was Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had thought that having Steven meant having everything of his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana risked everything for love, and at least now she got a response. Steven had always loved her in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was the foolish one, worrying and exhausting herself for George, stealing confidential information for him, but in the end, she got nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George only left her a few companies. Those failing companies are now all in a loss-making state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Steven in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knows about Steven and Queenie's affair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were once a match made in heaven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for that live broadcast where Steven revealed he and Diana were the real couple, no one would have known about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They always thought the woman Steven would marry was Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said coldly, "Queenie, I didn't expose what you did because I didn't want to be the subject of gossip."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The reason I stayed with you back then was because the Marsh family, under your instigation, bullied Diana every day. Diana endured it for the sake of family, but you kept pushing your limits."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Later, Diana fought back and cut ties with the Marsh family. All of this was part of your plan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula raised you with care, yet you wanted to kill them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone has seen through the past year's livestreams or news how vicious the Marsh family was to Diana. To protect her life, I also joined in bullying her. I was wrong too. And it was all because of your instigation. I have evidence. If you want to see it, I'll make it public."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie forgot that Steven wasn't afraid of public opinion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He once hurt Diana, and he dares to openly admit it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those are facts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every night, Steven falls asleep with regret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, everyone knows your thoughts. The man you love looks exactly like Mr. Gellar. Now that man is in prison, yet you insult Mr. Gellar and Mrs. Gellar."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We know the truth very well. Paula regretted her actions and personally said it was you who wanted to take the Barnes family's assets. Now you're trying to use public opinion to threaten Mr. Gellar."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, don't think you've hidden your true colors well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speaker is Diken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saved the Toby family. Diken hates the vicious Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie glared at Diken. If she kept pushing, she'd only ruin her reputation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, no one knows she's the CEO, or her company's products would face a boycott.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought, "Damn Diana. Why does everyone help her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Queenie's helpless expression. Queenie could only buy the necklace with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This auction house belongs to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, Steven really knows how to make money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Mario and said, "Mario, gather the money. We'll leave after paying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario angrily looked at her and said, "I told you to stop, but you just wouldn't listen. You're too stubborn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario glanced at Diana and thought she was quite sensible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was already upset, and upon hearing Mario's reproach, she yelled, "Mario, how could even you treat me like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was extremely angry at this moment. Everyone was looking at her with unfriendly eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie believed she was the future business queen and refused to endure such slander.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario loved Queenie, but she impulsively spent eight billion dollars on a necklace. Meanwhile, they needed a large amount of money to sign contracts with foreign companies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if this necklace were auctioned again, it would at most be worth one billion dollars. They would still lose seven billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They lost their liquidity and now have to mortgage the company for a loan. This carries great risk. What angered him was Queenie's stubbornness and refusal to listen to advice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario gathered the last few billion dollars and acquired Stellar Love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next up is the second auction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a pink diamond necklace, auctioned off by Cecil for two hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last necklace was a white crystal necklace, Unfading Love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven spent nine hundred million dollars to win Unfading Love and gave it to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven placed Unfading Love in Diana's hands, looked at her smiling face, and gently said, "Diana, from now on, in my life, in my world, there's only you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the beautiful necklace, feeling very happy, and said, "Steven, I'll accept this necklace. This is the first time you've genuinely given me a gift."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt guilty and suddenly smiled, asking, "Diana, does what you just said still count?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1150.html">« Prev</a><a href="1152.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
