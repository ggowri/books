She had grown up in the mountains and rarely had the chance to come out and play for a few days. Diana didn't want to disturb her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Olivia, I have to deal with something at the company. I have to go back first. I'll come pick you up later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia sat up abruptly. "Diana, your voice sounds off. Wait for me. I'll go back with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She got out of bed, grabbed a comfortable set of clothes from the suitcase on the floor, and went to the bathroom to change.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't even glance at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her heart-wrenching back, feeling his heart tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia pushed the door open and saw Steven. She was puzzled. How could this jerk be here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, are you here to bully Diana again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's hands clenched at his sides. "I'm just calling it as it is. I'm not bullying her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia looked at him and thought of something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned slightly and said, "It seems I need to sever the bond between you two. You've hurt Diana deeply. You'll subject her to torment, even destruction. If that's the case, then I'll just cut off your relationship directly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dare you?" Steven's eyes were filled with a fierce intent to harm. He threatened, "Olivia, I've already looked into your identity. If you dare to interfere with my marriage and damage my relationship with Diana, I'll make you regret it. I'll turn your entire temple into rubble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia, however, was not afraid. "You can go ahead and smash it, but I will never allow my best friend to be hurt and battered."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had already made up her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to intimidate Olivia, Steven clenched his fists in anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia felt a mighty chill sweep over everything around them like a storm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned but was not afraid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Diana had already changed her clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Olivia, let's go," Diana said as she went over to pick up her suitcase.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia could tell she was in a bad state. She took the suitcase from Diana's hand, and they went downstairs together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven reached the first floor and received another call from Queenie. He looked at Diana, who was walking ahead with her head down, and he didn't answer the call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You take my car to go back. Diana, don't try anything funny."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia retorted, "Shut up, jerk! Can't you see Diana is in a bad state?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze was icy. "I think she's just scared!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked up at him sharply. "Where is Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her intensely. "At the Marsh Villa."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go. I won't be afraid, nor will I run. Mr. Gellar, you don't have to worry about me playing tricks. Remember what I said before? I will return the ways you've bullied me to you. So, I will definitely go to see Queenie and Cecil."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven got into his car with a face full of anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once in the car, Diana called Luna.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luna, compile the video of Queenie ordering people to hit Madam Farley's bodyguard and deliver it to the Marsh Villa. Wait for me outside if I haven't arrived yet. If Madam Farley's bodyguard has recovered, bring him along."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna replied, "Yes, Ms. Bishop."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia drove furiously. She didn't ask Diana what had happened. She would find out when they arrived at the Marsh Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour later, they finally arrived at the Marsh Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had not spoken a word the entire time, just resting with her eyes closed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven followed Diana's car all the way. He saw her car stop in front of the Marsh Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was already standing at the entrance waiting for Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana get out of the car, she walked over. "Ms. Bishop!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at her and asked, "Is everything ready?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna glanced at the car and responded, "Yes.
