"Ben Marrow, didn't you used to call me Ms. Bishop? Stick with that. Don't make me sick with that 'Mrs.' nonsense."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ben kept his head down, not daring to speak, maintaining his inviting gesture.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew he was just following orders, so she didn't give him a hard time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell Steven we're divorced. Tell him to get lost and stay lost."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car window slowly rolled down, revealing Steven's handsome face. His deep-set eyes gazed at Diana</span><span> and </span><span>his voice flat. "Get in the car. Let's go home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a scoff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, do you even know what a divorce is? Maybe you should go back to elementary school." Diana's voice was taut with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes grew even more intense. "Diana, get in the car. I won't ask twice."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't want to waste any more breath on you. I won't go home with you. At Queenie's birthday party, you forced me to leave. Now you want me back? Steven, have you had a personality transplant or a heart replacement?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or maybe you've got water on the brain and forgotten what you did?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You hurt me to the core, and now you want to take me home? What do you think I am? Something you can summon and dismiss at will?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her unfamiliar gaze, fell silent for a moment, and then said, "I wronged you that night. You did nothing wrong, so there's no need for a divorce, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was so angry she could've knocked his teeth out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a sneer. She remembered how this man had pushed her down without a second thought. Even now, the memory chilled her to the bone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no way she could live under the same roof as him ever again!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, you've been carrying on an affair with Queenie this whole time. Now you want me to come back and be your free nanny?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of all he had done pierced her heart like a needle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven </span><span>frowned,</span><span> his tone cold. "I never thought of it that way. That's because you've done so many things wrong..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cut him off sharply. "Shut up! I've never done anything wrong. It's you two lovebirds and those idiots in the Marsh family who framed me. You think a flippant 'you were wrong' can make up for all the pain I've suffered over the years?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana lowered her eyes, feeling the weight of her past life and this one. The exhaustion was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She kept her gaze down, wanting nothing more than to cut ties with Steven for good. She said slowly, "Steven, you've brought up divorce countless times. I've agreed. Why are you still hounding me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Steven let out a mocking laugh. "Diana, you're imagining things. I'm not hounding you. You're my wife. As long as we're not divorced, you should come back home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How can I go back to a loveless marriage? I won't go back with you!" She'd rather die than be with this man again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes narrowed, his patience wearing thin. He yanked the car door open and strode over to Diana.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="74.html">« Prev</a><a href="76.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
