She glared back at Queenie and asked, "What are you sneering at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie raised her eyebrows, glanced at her, and mocked, "Diana, are you daydreaming? You are just a country bumpkin. How dare you want to make a fortune?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with my daydreaming? What does it have to do with you!" Diana knew that Queenie was always trying to plot against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Queenie disregarded the occasion, Diana would fight back when necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, "It has nothing to do with me. I just want to remind you that you will never be a rich woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless. She was now wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only to prevent Queenie from knowing that it was not exposed.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I will definitely beat you today." Queenie was very confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Don't worry. It's just a Fashion Cup. No one will fight with you. It's always you who really hurt yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled. In her previous life, she bet that Steven would be moved by her sincerity one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what awaited her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a murder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never received a single cordial word from him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and Queenie, who had seemed to be in love, now gradually drifted apart even without her intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige gazed at her back with derision. "What bad luck! She's everywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie trembled all over. Paige escaped last time, and now she dared to mock her. Queenie planned to teach her a lesson today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sent a message to her secret bodyguard. She had been resting these days since the miscarriage and had not caused Diana any trouble, which was why she was so presumptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving a response, she stopped, turned around, and cast an evil glance at Paige, who was talking to Diana lovingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They did not notice Queenie's vicious gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wanted to take a look at the front and thus asked Paige to go backstage and communicate with the models. She was relieved as Pa</span><span>i</span><span>ge and her team of models grew in popularity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She emerged from the backstage area into the lobby when two men in black entered.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were coming in and out, so Diana didn't take them seriously. She just thought that they were bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She arrived at the lobby, which was packed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a collision of fashion styles and a visual feast. She liked such places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan walked up to her and exclaimed, "Diana!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised to see him so excited. "Nolan, I'm not the champion. Why are you so excited!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just excited, Diana. Actually, you don't have to give in to Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the company was growing stronger, Queenie was nothing to be afraid of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana was still very low-key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head and laughed, "Well, let's go in. The competition is about to start."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan told Diana about the competition. "Okay! Diana, there are more than 50 fashion companies in Capitole participating in the competition. Winning first place this time will bring us a lot of cooperation and help the company grow</span><span> day by day</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also realized that it was a good opportunity, </span><span>and</span><span> she smiled, "Take it easy. I will perform normally, not over the top."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan understood that she didn't want to win.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="842.html">« Prev</a><a href="844.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
