"Diana, before you came back, I didn't check your fortune, but I did a reading for your love life. Everything pointed to things being great. So why are you suddenly getting a divorce? I just don't get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wanted to say that maybe even Olivia could get it wrong sometimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But deep down, she knew Olivia wasn't the type to make mistakes. With a calm smile, she replied, "Olivia, maybe it's just not the right time yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia narrowed her eyes, clearly not convinced, but chose to keep her thoughts to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, Olivia drove Diana to the Courthouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they arrived, Olivia parked the car and retrieved a wheelchair, helping Diana into it before pushing her toward the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait," Diana said suddenly. "Let's double-check everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She meticulously went through the documents. "Alright, all here. The divorce agreement is with Steven. Since we don't have any property disputes, it should be pretty simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia shook her head, exasperated. "Diana, you've been married to him for years. You didn't take a single penny from him, even paid for his treatments out of your own pocket, and now you're just walking away? Seriously?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled faintly and turned to her friend. "Olivia, I don't want anything from him. I just want a clean break. No more ties and entanglements. He lives his life, and I live mine. That's it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia sighed, throwing her hands up. "Fine, fine. You're a self-made queen, after all. Let's go get that freedom you're so set on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you're a star. Once you shake off all this mess, you're going to shine brighter than ever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana didn't laugh. For some reason, her smile just wouldn't come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, a man sat in a wheelchair, bundled up in layers. His eyes stayed locked on her back, a storm of pain swirling in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spoke in a low voice, "Is everything ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man beside him nodded. "Everything's in place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the hall, Diana was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was standing. His forehead and chest were bandaged, but he was on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beside him, Queenie clung to his arm, her movements overly intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's brows knitted together as unease crept in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Olivia, I can't even stand. How is he walking? I'm pretty sure his injuries were worse than mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia scoffed. "Please, he only fractured his arm. The rest? Barely a scratch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's frown deepened. "That doesn't add up. I'm a doctor. I know what I saw. He passed out on the spot. There's no way his injuries were less severe than mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana tried to make sense of it, Steven's icy voice sliced through the air. "Diana, you're late. Do you even know what punctuality means?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That familiar yet distant tone sent a chill down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her mind, another voice from her past echoed, booming like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, just go die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voice she heard today was identical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes widened in shock as she stared at Steven, unease prickling at her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Something was terribly wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, when Steven had pushed her, his voice and eyes had felt just as cold and unfamiliar as they did now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smirked, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "Diana, don't tell me you're having second thoughts about divorcing Steven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Diana could respond, Steven's voice rang out, sharp with anger. "Diana, you're signing those papers today whether you want to or not. The only woman I care about is Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wrapped his good arm around Queenie, pulling her close as if to drive the point home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight stung. Diana felt a sharp ache in her chest as tears pricked her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, despite her emotions, her doctor's instincts kicked in. Something didn't add up. Steven's left arm had been the one injured, but it was his right arm now wrapped in a cast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She distinctly remembered feeling the wound on his left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But everything else about him, his expressions, his movements, even his voice felt so familiar, except for the subtle accent that wasn't quite right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She dropped her gaze, avoiding his cold, piercing stare. Her voice was calm, almost detached. "Fine by me. Let's get this over with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Olivia. "Olivia, take me to the counter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie visibly relaxed, a triumphant smile spreading across her face. With the divorce finalized, Diana would no longer have any claim or leverage, and Queenie could finally shed the label of mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The paperwork was processed quickly. Within minutes, Diana and Steven both held their divorce certificates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at the document in her hand, a weight lifting off her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven," Queenie beamed as she glanced at Steven's certificate. "Now I can officially be your fianc&eacute;e."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled warmly and planted a soft kiss on her forehead, a public display of their new beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, both Diana and Steven's phones buzzed incessantly, notification after notification lighting up their screens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Curious, Diana unlocked her phone. Her eyes widened as she read the first message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a transfer of forty billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She blinked in disbelief, scrolling through more messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[All assets under the Gellar group, including the headquarters and 1999 subsidiaries nationwide, have been transferred to Diana.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[99 luxury villas in Capitole, 60 shopping centers, office buildings, and every asset under Steven's name in Luspus Hill, Westwood, Luspus, and Banngrad are now owned by Diana.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her jaw dropped. "Am I dreaming? Did I just win the lottery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing behind her, Olivia leaned over to read the messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes nearly popped out of her head. "Diana, this is insane! Steven must've cared about you way more than he let on. He gave you everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Steven, her head spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Across the room, Steven's face was pale, his body trembling. Queenie, on the other hand, looked like she might pass out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A memory seemed to hit Queenie, her expression twisting as she recalled the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana's shock gave way to a smirk. In an instant, she went from being free of her marriage to becoming one of the wealthiest women alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's voice thundered across the room. "Diana, what the hell did you do? How is everything under my name now yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes gleamed with amusement as she met his furious glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd thought the contract was a joke, something Helen made up to tease her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, it was all too real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of donating his wealth elsewhere, Helen had handed it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sheer magnitude of it was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was more money than she could ever spend in a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to Olivia, Diana managed a laugh despite her disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Olivia, pinch me. Is this real? How does something like this even happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her initial excitement was quickly replaced by a gnawing unease. This wasn't a gift but a ticking time bomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could already imagine the chaos Andrew's illegitimate children would unleash. They wouldn't stop until they tore her apart for this inheritance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face darkened, his voice cold and menacing. "Diana, answer me! What did you do to get your hands on my assets?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="902.html">« Prev</a><a href="904.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
