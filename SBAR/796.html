Paige, if you&#x27;re looking for a man, go find one on your own. Don&#x27;t drag my wife into your mess,&quot; he snapped, his voice icy and filled with barely restrained fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paige felt a rush of fear wash over her at his intensity.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Uh, Mr. Gellar, where did you come from?&quot; she managed to stammer, taken aback by his sudden appearance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a cold laugh, he shot back, &quot;No matter where I came from, it doesn&#x27;t give you the right to meddle in my wife&#x27;s affairs. I will cherish her. She belongs to me alone, and no one else.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His possessiveness was palpable, sending another chill through her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paige couldn&#x27;t help but scoff at his arrogance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Seriously? You&#x27;re with Queenie now. Why can&#x27;t Diana find someone else? She&#x27;s attractive and desirable, and there are plenty of men who would treat her right. If you don&#x27;t value her, someone else will.&quot; Anger surged within her as she recalled the times she and Diana had witnessed the bullying from Steven and the Marsh family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Choosing to divorce was indeed the smartest move for Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s eyes darkened, his handsome features sharpening into a cold mask. &quot;Paige, if you dare interfere with my wife, I&#x27;ll ensure your company is gone by morning.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His threat infuriated Paige. &quot;You...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before she could say more, Diana pulled at her sleeve, urging her to back down. &quot;Paige, don&#x27;t provoke him. He&#x27;s capable of anything.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Realizing the danger, Paige fell silent. The Sutton family was in no position to withstand a single word from Steven. His influence could easily destroy them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven glanced at Paige and Althea. &quot;You should leave for now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paige opened her mouth to argue, but Diana quickly interrupted, &quot;Paige, Althea, you two go on ahead. I&#x27;ll catch up with you later.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She handed them a slice of cake to take home, and they left, casting wary glances at Steven as they stepped outside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As soon as the door closed, Steven swept Diana into his arms, startling her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What... are you doing?&quot; she gasped, her hands pushing against his chest as she looked up, wide-eyed with surprise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a low chuckle, he leaned closer, his breath warm against her ear. &quot;Honey, there&#x27;s no need to look for other men. Just take a look at me. My body is just as good as those men.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He set her down and unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his sculpted abs, each muscle beautifully defined and irresistibly enticing. The seductive allure in his voice sent her heart racing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana couldn&#x27;t tear her eyes away, mesmerized by his physique.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven noticed her fascination and smirked, stepping closer. &quot;Want to test my strength?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His tone was intoxicating, thick with temptation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana snapped back to reality at the sound of his voice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Y-You better not come any closer! I&#x27;m not interested in testing anything. I have things to do! Let&#x27;s go see something interesting. Just don&#x27;t think about anything else!&quot; she stammered, backing away nervously, feeling utterly flustered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She hadn&#x27;t even thought about Steven being there while Paige spoke.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His gaze lingered on her flushed cheeks, and a wild desire sparked within him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He didn&#x27;t care about women like Queenie, and his focus was solely on his wife.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Leaning in with a wicked grin, he teased, &quot;Diana, what if I just want to think about you?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="795.html">« Prev</a><a href="797.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
