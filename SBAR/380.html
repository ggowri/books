She had long been dissatisfied with Evan, who had always been speaking for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was suspicious. Queenie said aggrievedly, "Evan, how much benefit did Diana give you? Why did you speak up for her and care about her so much? Or did you two have an affair? Otherwise, why did you speak up for Diana from the very beginning?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and looked at Evan, who always spoke for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Steven's expression, Evan knew that Steven doubted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Marsh, are you trying to sow discord between me and Mr. Gellar? I have no relationship with Ms. Bishop. I simply can't stand your viciousness." Evan frowned. Seeing Steven's suspicious eyes, he felt depressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan didn't expect Steven to suspect him. Evan thought, "I hate Steven, too. Only Diana really loved him, but he pushed her away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was angry, thinking, "What? I'm vicious? Humph, Evan hasn't seen my real viciousness yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt even more aggrieved. "Evan, I'm just surprised why you always help Diana. Did I say something wrong about today's incident? Diana helped Paige to ruin my brother's wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, those little fights before were just some tricks between women. Men also have such competition fights. Diana can't afford to lose, and she put all the blame on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan didn't say anything, and he didn't want to say anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He worked for Steven. Since Steven doubted him, Evan just kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said nothing, opened the car door, and got in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan sat in the driver's seat and drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie watched Steven's car with gloomy eyes. She thought, "Steven, you said you would marry me. You can't get rid of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Somehow, Queenie kew she had lost control on Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the condition continued like this, she had to use other methods to let Steven listen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie narrowed her eyes and thought, "It seems that I have to speed up the plan. Those two old guys in the Gellar family have to die. After that, Steven will definitely hate Diana. When my man comes back, he must take over Steven's position. Otherwise, all my efforts will be in vain. Steven, I hope you can hate Diana forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie clenched her teeth and swore, "Diana, I will send you to hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie took out her mobile phone and called Mario, "Mario, find a hypnotist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario asked, "Miss, are you going to take action against Steven?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That man sent Mario to assist Queenie and gave her advice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes were vicious. "Yes! He still has some trust in me. I must take advantage of this opportunity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hung up the phone with a malicious smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the car, Steven looked at the silent Evan and said calmly, "Evan, you are the person I trust the most around me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was stunned, and then he smiled, "It's my pleasure, Mr. Gellar." Evan's depressed mood suddenly improved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven then looked at Even from the rearview mirror and said, "Evan, we need to act out a scene in front of Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan hesitated. "If you do this, Ms. Bishop will..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just do as I said," Steven interrupted Evan coldly and then closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away, Paula looked at Queenie. The hatred in her eyes grew stronger. Paula thought, "It turns out that Queenie sent Elsie to Frank."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="379.html">« Prev</a><a href="381.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
