When he smiled, he appeared tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana unconsciously thought of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Breakfast is ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was momentarily stunned at her voice. "Okay!" he replied, gracefully going downstairs and going to the dining room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was already seated, and in addition to the burritos, she'd prepared oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and avocado toast.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing his favorite breakfast burrito, Steven beamed. "Thank you!" he said, diving into the meal with elegant movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him, slightly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he actually said thank you? It was a pleasant surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Steven drove Diana to the office. She was in a light-hearted mood all day until the afternoon rolled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Steven came to pick her up for the banquet that she came back to her senses, realizing how busy she had been. Even as she got into the car, she was still wrapped up in her work.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the entrance of the banquet hall, Steven said, "Diana, we're here now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" She replied, quickly shutting her laptop before adding, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stepped out of the car and headed for the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was also at the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's a wonderful party! Let me show you around," came a cheerful voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula turned around abruptly at the familiar sound, spotting Queenie. She asked on purpose, "Queenie, what did you just call her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard by Paula's sudden appearance, Queenie thought, "How could she be here and hear that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already upset due to Levi breaking his promise, she replied coldly and impatiently, "You must have misheard."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula stared at her in confusion. "Misheard? I distinctly heard you call her mom. I'm the one who raised you! You know how much effort I've put into your upbringing. How could you call her mom?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This woman was having an affair with your father! How could you betray me like this? I've been the one to raise you, taking care of you while neglecting your four brothers. You've always been our favorite. How could you call that woman mom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's voice grew more agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was taken aback, frightened by Paula's emotional outburst. She understood Paula was hurt, but what could she do?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt nothing wrong with plotting against Paula, and she just helped her own mother get what she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie, overhearing Paula's insult, fumed. "Paula, Queenie is my own daughter. If you need someone to blame, it's Jeff. He abandoned your daughter and chose to raise mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the real bitch. I can't stand stupid people like you. You have nothing now, and this event isn't meant for you. I am the legal Mrs. Marsh."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had waited over 20 years for this moment and could finally stand tall before Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pretending to be hurt, Paula staggered back in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what did you just say? Queenie is your daughter with Jeff?" Her eyes widened in shock.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="636.html">« Prev</a><a href="638.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
