"Steven, I didn't realize you were such a sore loser. Can you really not accept the contract you signed yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved her eyes, and a smile appeared on her face. Her beauty shined even more brightly in the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George nearly shouted, "That agreement is void. You manipulated Grandpa and Grandma into signing it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned, noting the stark difference between George and Steven. George lacked the deep elegance and composure that Steven possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven never lost his temper. He would merely smirk, never uttering such foolish words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that while they shared the same face, their intellects were worlds apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without comparison, one could hardly appreciate the difference, but now it was glaringly obvious that George had wasted his looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice was cold and assertive. "Whether it's valid or not, it's already in effect. You two barged into my office, and I suspect you're here to steal trade secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George stammered, "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped closer, towering over her. "Diana, no matter how greedy you are, you should think of Grandma and Grandpa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!" Diana replied with flat tone, but her words carried a sharp edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While you two were busy enjoying each other's company last night, I took the liberty of sending Helen away. If you think you can use her to threaten me, you're dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie exploded in rage. Last night, she had warned George that Helen could be used to threaten Diana, knowing how much Diana valued family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Diana could care less about Paula or the four useless ones, Queenie knew Diana would be concerned about Helen, the one who had always given her warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, George didn't take it to heart. He couldn't fathom how a divorced woman could still be so attached to Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George hesitated, and his eyes narrowed at Diana, filling with a chilling malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met his glare with an icy stare, recognizing the subtle differences between him and Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven carried an innate nobility and a hint of rebellious charm, while the man before her radiated nothing but hostility, sending chills down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Nick. "Nick, throw these trespassers out of my office. If they resist, call the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George exchanged shocked glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Is this really the meek Diana we once knew?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Bishop," Nick responded, ready to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, over a dozen bodyguards rushed out of the office, surrounding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked at Diana, and her expression was twisted with malice. "Diana, we've prepared all the transfer documents for you in the office. Just sign them, and you can walk away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana clicked her tongue, shaking her head at Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind? The assets just transferred to me yesterday. Do you think you can just reverse that today? You're dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have the authority or the ability to make me sign anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had put up with Queenie long enough and wasn't about to let it slide now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie pointed at the bodyguards behind her, her arrogance on full display. "Diana, do you see them? They're all mercenaries. You won't be leaving here today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met her provocation with calm defiance. "With that kind of confidence, I can't wait to see you eat your words. Just remember, when the time comes, don't cry. I've told you many times before that your tears really disgust me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glared at her, waving her hand. "Throw them all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, chaos erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Luna, who quickly informed her, "Diana, the police are on their way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the word "police," Queenie glared at Diana, and fury radiated from her. "Hoe dare you call the cops?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her as if she were an idiot. "You're trying to steal my company. If I don't call the police now, should I wait until you've taken everything before I make the call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're utterly shameless!" Queenie shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smirked. "I'll return that word to you. Is there anyone more shameless than you, Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her hired mercenaries fall one by one only fueled her fury. "Useless! You're all a bunch of useless fools! Hit them harder, throw them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, today's plan had to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finally sending Steven to the grave, it was time for Diana to join him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, Queenie was shocked to see the expensive mercenaries she had hired being taken down by Diana's bodyguards, one after another, and then dragged into the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Queenie and George were left standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't believe that Diana's bodyguards were so formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, where did you find these bodyguards?" she demanded, and disbelief was etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled calmly. "They're not from anywhere special. They've been with me since childhood, trained rigorously. Their combat skills and intelligence are leagues above the likes of your mercenaries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words struck a nerve. "Bodyguards since childhood? Who are you, really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wondered, realizing she had overlooked something crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Why does Diana have such loyal bodyguards?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These are the kind of protectors who will stand by her unconditionally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Queenie grasped that she didn't truly understand Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana locked eyes with her, sensing the despair in Queenie's gaze. "Queenie, I'm the kind of lady you could never hope to reach. Even without Paula in my life, I'm still out of your league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's slender frame trembled slightly. Her icy and malicious eyes were fixed on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why didn't you reveal your identity when you got back home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's smile turned dazzling. "Why would I steal your thunder? Watching you flail around is quite entertaining, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was left speechless, realizing the joke was on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it can't be! If you really are a high-society lady, why have you never mentioned it before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She refused to accept that Diana could be a true heiress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, just because some people call you respectfully doesn't mean you can act like a high-society lady."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression turned frosty. "You have no right to know my business. The police are on their way. If you don't want them to haul you off and ruin your career, you might want to stop causing trouble here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter your reasons, the company is now under my name. Even if you claim I'm a fraud, do you have any proof?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you really can't take a loss, can you? When you signed that agreement, you knew full well that all assets would belong to me after your affair. Now that I've reclaimed what's mine, why are you making a scene?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have plenty of evidence of your infidelity. Should I let the media know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gestured toward the floor below. "By the way, I'm officially taking over the Gellar Group today. I've invited a whole bunch of reporters. I'll let them know we just finalized our divorce, and you and Queenie have been carrying on behind my back."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="911.html">« Prev</a><a href="913.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
