It was the first time Diana had seen such a smile on Cecil, and it was simply too handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was momentarily stunned; this man could really make women lose their heads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was her type, a bit wicked and very handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she could only accept him as her friend, not a life partner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wondered who could win this man's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, she heard Cecil's pleasant voice. "Diana, even though we're going camping on the island, there's no need to suffer on a deserted one. We'll sleep on the cruise ship tonight. I checked, and the tide won't rise this evening, so we're safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought, "This pampered young master can't stand a bit of hardship. Forget it, I'll just go along with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After they boarded the boat, the captain set sail. The scenery was picturesque, and Diana felt very calm inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever she was in a bad mood or too tired, she would go sit by the sea and enjoy the picturesque scenery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Steven's boat was following behind, but the people in the cabin did not notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The journey out to the sea took two hours, and Paige brought some cards to kill time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them started playing cards. Diana loved playing cards; when she was on the island, her brothers would play with her during their evening rest. Sometimes they would deliberately lose to her and give her many gifts or money, making her happy all night. Thinking of her brothers' kindness, Diana smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't understand the sincerity of that affection before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some blood-related siblings can still scheme against each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her three brothers loved her from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sent a message in the chat group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [Tobias, Julius, Hubery, do you still remember when we played cards together?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Diana sent out her message, both Tobias and Julius replied to her, telling her to have a good time and even sending her a lot of money. Only Hubery still ignored her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was very sad; Hubery was still unwilling to forgive her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Cecil urged Diana, "Diana, it's your turn to play."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon looking at her cards, Diana said, "I quit this round."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige nudged her and said, "Diana, focus; we're about to lose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and took one last look at the chat group. Hubery still wasn't willing to talk to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She will definitely continue to work hard until he forgives her. Hubery, who has always loved her the most since childhood, will surely forgive her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana lowered her head to look at the cards and said, "Pass."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige cursed, "Fuck, he won!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil laughed so hard he was bending over, "I won again. I didn't expect playing cards to be this much fun. This is the most interesting game I've ever played."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Paige gave him a glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige glared at Cecil angrily, "Mr. Farley, do you know that boys should give in to girls? Acting like this, you won't get a girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was stunned by her shamelessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige couldn't afford to lose!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't want to give in to them; his luck was just too good, with excellent cards in every hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had already started dealing the cards. As soon as Cecil spread out his hand, he broke into a joyful laugh. "Ladies, it's not that I don't want to give in to you, it's just that my cards are too good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Paige suddenly looked at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They instantly took his hands and touched them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girls' hands were very soft, which made him blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at the two women, somewhat puzzled, and asked, "What are you two doing? Harassing me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige took out her phone, very excited. "Mr. Farley, your luck is so good. I just borrowed a bit of your luck by touching your hand. I'm going to buy a couple of lottery tickets right now. Maybe I'll win the big prize tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana did the same thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This confused Cecil.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="403.html">« Prev</a><a href="405.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
