I just finished handling things abroad.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said, &quot;There&#x27;s no need to travel on business this winter, nor to go abroad. I met your elder brother; he&#x27;s handling some matters over there and won&#x27;t be back for a while. He asked me to take care of you. I was thinking of inviting you out for dinner today, to start taking care of you from tomorrow, but you&#x27;re going away again.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes, I&#x27;m going to meet a friend, and it will take about half a month. I&#x27;ve grown up; I can take care of myself,&quot; she said.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana knew that Alexander was for her good from his sincere eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She felt very warm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander smiled gently and said in a soft voice, &quot;Tobias might not return this winter. He&#x27;s working on a big project abroad, and I&#x27;m collaborating with him. But the shares are for you; he really loves you very much. If this project succeeds, I estimate we could make over a billion dollars.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled happily. &quot;Yeah! Tobias has always loved me since I was little. I was just too naive, thinking that if I returned to the Marsh family, my brother would also care for me, and my parents would care about me. I didn&#x27;t expect it would cost me my life.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s a good thing I came to my senses, and Tobias didn&#x27;t hold it against me. He is the best brother in the world,&quot; she continued.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana knew that her three brothers loved her very much.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She would never do such stupid things again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Alexander learned about her situation, he also came to despise the Marsh family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, don&#x27;t always feel guilty about this. It&#x27;s winter now, and Tobias actually wants you to go abroad. The winters there are beautiful. He&#x27;s worried about leaving you here alone, but he said you might not want to go, as you have other things to do by staying here,&quot; he said,</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander actually hoped she stayed, to be with Diana, as he felt very comfortable around her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No other woman could give him this feeling.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I do indeed have some things to take care of. Tobias and the others are all working hard on their careers, and I also want to build up my own wealth.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After all, Tobias couldn&#x27;t protect her forever.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wanted to become strong herself, so that no one would dare to bully her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wanted to be her own queen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander looked at her confident smile, as if she was glowing all over.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She liked to wear a pink coat, which made her skin look very fair, like an enticing pudding.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said with a light smile, &quot;Diana, you are truly beautiful!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The words slipped out before he could stop himself, and then the tips of his ears turned red.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was slightly stunned, then smiled and said, &quot;Alexander, you&#x27;re also very handsome.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander smiled happily at her compliment. &quot;Diana, you always speak so cutely.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He couldn&#x27;t help but steal a few more glances at her. Men were all visual creatures, and Diana was indeed stunning. Every time they met, she was so radiant, making it hard for him to look away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana lowered her head to eat, when suddenly a dark figure stood beside her. The familiar scent wafted over, and the piece of meat she had just picked up fell back into her plate.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="540.html">« Prev</a><a href="542.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
