When Owen arrived at Steven's house, he didn't go in and left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven returned to the villa and glanced at the cold hall. His eyes became more and more sinister.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In two years, Diana had changed his life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of her blocking him made his gloomy eyes colder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven also thought that Diana was unwilling to admit that she had saved him in order to distance herself from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven got angrier and angrier. And when he thought of Diana's disappointed look, he felt that he would really lose Diana this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, Diana slept until she woke up naturally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she woke up, her cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Luna.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luna, is there something wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "Ms. Bishop, there is a routine meeting day, I was afraid you forgot it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There have been some problems with the clothing design under our name recently, Nolan asked you to go to the company today."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned and asked slowly, "What's the problem?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said in a cold and angry tone, "Ms. Milton, the company's design director, was hired by the company of Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cursed in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did Steven always go against her in everything?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's okay. I just happened to be free recently. I will serve as the company's design director. You can tell Nolan that I am the company's design director temporarily. Don't reveal my identity."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was very happy and said, "Ms. Bishop, with you here, you will make Ms. Milton feel ashamed. She also took away our new products for autumn."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes suddenly darkened, and she said, "She took away more than just the design draft. She probably took the company's confidential information. Let Nolan check what happened. We must hurry up. We can only deal with it when we know what she had taken away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "Okay, Ms. Bishop."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up the phone and looked cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't expect that Emma would switch to the Gellar Group, which caught her off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn't care about people she couldn't keep, but she was very angry when Emma left so suddenly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't do anything wrong to Emma these two years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She went downstairs to wash up and prepare to go to the company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana went downstairs to have breakfast and had already changed into clothes to go to the company. Leopold and Tobias looked at each other in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wondered if she was going to the company since she dressed like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold couldn't stop smiling and said, "Diana, a miracle happens. You are finally going to the company."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled a little embarrassedly. She didn't like the intrigues in the company and she preferred cooking. "Grandpa, Tobias, I feel that money is more attractive. </span><span>T</span><span>ens of million</span><span>s of dollars for </span><span>a month at such a young age, isn't it attractive?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was determined to have much more money than Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Leopold applauded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold cried with joy and excitement and said, "Diana, you've grown up, come quickly for breakfast."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked over with a smile and sat next to Tobias, saying, "Tobias, hasn't Olivia gotten up yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh! She had something to do and left early."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias handed her a glass of milk and said, "Shall I arrange for a driver to take you to the company?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No, I'll drive over there myself. My company's design director has been hired by another company. I'm now the design director of my company. There's no difficulty I can't overcome."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana drank the milk in one gulp, looking domineering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias watched her cheer up and felt relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hoped she could be persistent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After breakfast, Diana drove to the company by herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's company was opposite Steven's company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's company was located in the tallest building in the most prosperous area of </span><span>Capitole</span><span> where every inch of land was valuable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's company was a five-story building.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's current financial resources were actually not as good as Steven's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the top floor of the skyscraper opposite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked out of the elevator so dominatingly that no one dared to approach him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan and Edison followed behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison stepped forward and reported, "Mr. Gellar, </span><span>L.Q's</span><span> design director has arrived, and her contract with that company has expired. And I received news that she was here this morning."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison was hesitant to say something. Steven stopped and looked at Edison, saying, "Who is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison shook his head and said, "We haven't found out who the new design director of L.Q is yet, but their official website has announced that Ms. Milton has left the company and took away the design drawings of Autumn products and </span><span>L.Q's</span><span> internal secrets. They applied for a patent and made rectifications in the shortest time possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Later, they released that L.Q has a new design director."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Emma was not very valuable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>L.Q was mysterious and capable, with a net profit of 600 million dollars last year.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the clothing industry, although L.Q was not as good as the high-end luxury brands under the Gellar Group, it was already very stable as a medium-sized enterprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was a little surprised. The boss of this company had never been found out. "Go check who the new design director of L.Q is."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edison nodded and said, "Okay, Mr. Gellar."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The office door opened, and there was a fashionably dressed woman with a tall figure and beautiful features sat inside. When she saw Steven coming in, she stood up with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Steven's charming figure, she couldn't hide her obsession with him in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Gellar, I'm Emma." It was the Gellar Group that hired her with a doubled salary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she also knew that working here was more stressful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded calmly and said indifferently, "The other party already knows that you have taken the commercial secrets. Apart from the design drawings in your hand, those secrets are useless. Report to the Fashion Design Department on the 12th floor."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma was stunned. It turned out that he had also seen the news released on the official website.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>L.Q reacted very fast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she left, someone was found to take her place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very curious about who was that woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had already asked her friends in the design department, and they had sent her the photos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, this is the new design director. Could you please help me investigate her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma handed the phone to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at the photo on her phone, frowned, and stared at her in surprise. "Are you sure it's her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan and Edison saw it and were also extremely shocked!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Diana!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="65.html">« Prev</a><a href="67.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
