It was just autumn, and she could make a lot of money from winter products.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one could stand in her way of getting rich.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, can we talk about cooperation on the way back? I know that the QM platform under your name is the most popular platform now. I can talk to you about my plan and give you a specific plan tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her with a smile, his eyes were deep and powerful, which couldn't be ignored. "Diana, do you still need to be so polite to me? I believe in your </span><span>ability and your products. Trust between people can be established as long as they meet for the first time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yes, trust between people could be established at first sight, but some people lowered their intelligence and eventually became idiots.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I knew I didn't misjudge you. You are different from those idiots." Diana got angry when she thought of Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh! Are you referring to your ex-husband Steven?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, her smile was brilliant and moving. "I didn't say it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's not talk about him. Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana followed him happily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't notice Steven behind her was furious and looking at her leaving gloomily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled as she looked at Alexander's back, which was mature and powerful. She thought a man should be like him, mature and intelligent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven, Owen, and Evan watched the two leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked cold as if winter had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen and Evan tacitly agreed not to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In some ways, Steven was just stupid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder Diana would do this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven still looked at Diana's happy back with cold eyes. Did she want to send Alexander home?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She is trying to seduce Alexander." Steven picked up the red wine on the table, tilted his head back, and drank it in one gulp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Evan and Owen were speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sounded jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and Luna sent Alexander to the villa area. Only then did Diana realize that Alexander lived in the same community as her, diagonally opposite her home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was such a coincidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alexander got out of the car, he looked at Diana who got off with him and said, "Diana, thank you for sending me back. Would you like to come in and sit for a while?" His voice was low and magnetic.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="69.html">« Prev</a><a href="71.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
