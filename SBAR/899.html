Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a deep breath. "I'm fine. Just make sure Steven is okay. He can't be hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her left leg was badly crushed, and the pain was intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car that had slammed into them came from the opposite direction. Clearly, someone wanted them dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dark look flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't sure if it was Queenie or the person behind her pulling the strings, but one thing was clear. They'd wanted them gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But luckily, they made it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on. Come on. Help them!" Evan shouted toward the rescue team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana heard the rescuers arriving and finally let out a breath of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She relaxed, hugging Steven tightly. "Steven, it's okay. We're safe now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what, they were alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, Diana and Steven were both in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had a minor fracture in her calf and had to get a cast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She watched as Steven was wheeled into surgery, and a deep unease settled in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like a heavy weight she couldn't shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at him, still unconscious. Her feelings were all over the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They'd drawn a clear line between them a long time ago, so why did something like this have to happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her mind was a mess. She hated that she felt any sympathy for him. He didn't deserve it. Everything that had happened was his own fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His harsh words still echoed in her mind, sharp as knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she remembered what Helen had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you're part of this too. Steven only wanted to protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't understand what she'd done wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here she was, given a second chance at life, yet she still had to go through all this unbearable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She closed her eyes in agony, biting her lip hard. The pressure was so intense that her skin tore and blood started to flow. The sharp pain brought her back to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weight of it all felt almost unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that moment, it felt like the world was against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been given a second shot at life, and all she wanted was to live every moment for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now everything was spiraling out of control...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie had stayed home all day. Amelie, who rarely cooked, had decided to make a nice meal for her and Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While she was in her room working, she noticed a familiar number pop up on her phone. A small smile tugged at her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Picking up the phone, she answered cheerfully. "Hello! Did it go as planned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, it worked. But they didn't die. They're both in the hospital, badly injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled faintly. "Good. I'm glad. I'll send you the money now. You need to leave the country immediately. I've booked your tickets. Hide out for a while, then come back. Steven's been keeping things under wraps, but once he's recovered, it'll be trouble for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it. I've already given the money to someone reliable, so you don't need to worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was calm. Before, she hadn't taken Steven seriously, but now, with him becoming a threat, she had to be extra careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting at her vanity, she looked up and was startled to see tears on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She froze for a moment, realizing she'd been crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quickly wiping away the tears, she couldn't understand why she felt this way about Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His death would've been her biggest relief. After all, she really loved George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe it was because they were both illegitimate children, hidden away from the world. They shared that painful bond, which made her love him so deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And truth be told, that man had always treated her better than Steven ever had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie picked up the phone and dialed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, Queenie, my flight's in three days. You can't wait, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled and said, "Yeah, I miss you. Steven got into a car accident tonight. He'll probably be in the hospital for a while. George, you know what I mean, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course I do, Queenie. I've already snatched up a few of his projects. Don't worry, I'll be back in three days. I'm coming to spend Christmas with you, remember? That's what you wanted, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's perfect! Aren't you planning to get back at Diana? Wait for me. I'll help you teach her a lesson when I'm back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sneered. "She's in the hospital too. Let's go together and do a checkup. We can humiliate her on purpose. I want her to suffer for the rest of her life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You little devil! Alright, I'll do whatever you want. Just remember to pick me up in three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's smile grew even sweeter. "I will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Queenie felt a rush of excitement. She stood up, ready to go downstairs and grab something to eat, but her mind was already working on a bigger plan, one that would make Steven disappear for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The villa was under Amelie's name, and Jeff had no idea. Amelie had also given Queenie a room here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she went downstairs, she saw Mark and immediately felt a surge of frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mark noticed her and smiled, greeting her warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, you're home too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie knew he could still be useful, so she smiled back and greeted him. "Yes, Mark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come sit down. I've got a business deal that might interest you. We should talk to your people about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Queenie heard that, she smiled approvingly. This was exactly what she wanted to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the villa, Paula had brought Jean along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had binoculars ready in the car and handed them to Jean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take a look, Jean. Your mom sent me to bring you here. She doesn't want to see you anymore, but she wants you to understand something. Your dad has other children now. From here on out, you and your brother will just be an afterthought to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After your mom left, your dad stopped paying attention to you two. The servants are the ones looking after you. I didn't bring you here to make you do anything but to help you see the truth and learn to stand up for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jean looked through the binoculars and saw Mark chatting happily with Queenie and Noah and even signing a contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This should have been a family moment, where Amelie included her and her brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She refused to believe her dad could forget about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nervously, she called Mark. When the call connected, her heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jean, what is it? Why are you calling me again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mark's cold voice made her tears flow silently. "Dad, we haven't even had dinner yet. Where are you? Why aren't you taking care of me and my brother anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jean, I've already told the servants to handle everything for you. If you want food, go home. Someone will cook for you. I'm working. I don't have time for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jean hung up the phone, her face covered in tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mark had promised that even after their mother left, he would always love her and her brother. But it hadn't been long, and already, he seemed to have forgotten about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was constantly complaining that they were useless, and now his business was facing serious problems without the support of Lily's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jean looked at Paula, who looked unwell and kept coughing. She hesitated but finally asked, "Ms. Barnes, how's my mom doing?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="898.html">« Prev</a><a href="900.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
