Frank had vanished without a trace, and even after involving the police, they couldn't locate him. Frank was likely dead, and despite staying close to Queenie, he hadn't found any evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was right. He was useless. He couldn't do anything right. Aside from driving, he had no other skills. Lately, Paula had been trying to teach him about contracts and how to manage the company. She still cared about him and hadn't given up on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a man reborn, he now spent every day frantically absorbing knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered at him, "You worthless piece of trash, you deserve to be nothing your whole life. After everything Jeff did to your family, you still respect him as your father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, feigning ignorance, asked, "Queenie, Dad's been the best to you. Why do you want me to take revenge on him? Isn't this the life you wanted?&nbsp;You guys have been planning this for so long. Wasn't it to reunite as a family? Now that you're together, why do you still want him dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grew more and more agitated as he spoke. Even if Jeff wanted them dead, it couldn't change the fact that he was their biological father.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refused to be the villain.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone were going to do it, it would be Queenie herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly disappointed in Jeff. Whether he lived or died, it would have nothing to do with him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff didn't deserve to be their father.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie let out a bitter laugh. She wondered if this was really the life she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had achieved her dreams, yet she felt like she'd gained nothing and lost everything instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because," she said venomously, "he has nothing left. He's no use to me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was shocked. So that was it. In this woman's eyes, there was only money.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Steven had cut off her five million dollar monthly allowance, she was short on cash. If Steven stopped spoiling her, she would surely turn on him soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was what he wanted. He wanted them to destroy each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric finally understood that Queenie was born without a conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved no one but herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled, "Queenie, I won't do anything. I've loved you since we were kids. I just want to stay by your side and take care of you. That's all I want to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's gaze toward him was filled with undisguised contempt and disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric deliberately ignored it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked. She thought, "What a fool indeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fine, let him stay. He still has his uses. I'll make sure to take full advantage of Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow morning, I'll make Diana wish she'd never been born."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having lunch with Cecil, he was called back to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana dropped him off at his office before heading to the hospital to visit Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hospital, she used the staff entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went straight to Tom's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick knock, she entered to find Tom reviewing patient files.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana, he offered a gentle smile. "Diana, you're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his white coat, Tom looked distinguished and handsome. Diana couldn't help but smile back, "Tom, I came to check on Lily."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom shook his head. "Lily hasn't regained consciousness yet, though her condition has improved. The frostbite on her lower legs was severe. I'm afraid there might be permanent damage."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Lily's lucky to be alive at all, all things considered."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom nodded. "If she'd been found any later, she wouldn't have made it. Between the severe hypothermia and her injuries... I've compiled all the diagnostic records. Once Lily wakes up, we'll finally know who did this to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you've been cleared of suspicion, I have a feeling they'll try to use this incident against us somehow."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Tom was on high alert, too. She let out a cold laugh. "Probably sooner rather than later."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="720.html">« Prev</a><a href="722.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
