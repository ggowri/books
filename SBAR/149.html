"There are plenty of places to talk around here. Why go to your house? It's tiring to go back and forth. Or I could meet you at your office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Diana finished speaking, she felt the coldness emanating from Steven. His chiseled features became even more rigid, and his eyes were unreadable. His voice left no room for argument. "I said I'll pick you up. I'm sorry I couldn't help you today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is there something wrong with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was actually apologizing. Too bad she didn't need his apology.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No need. You were never going to help me anyway. Go back to comforting your precious Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered and shot a glance at Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Disgusting!!!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie responded with a vicious glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had gotten smarter and more beautiful. The old tricks wouldn't work anymore. Queenie needed a new plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ever since Diana had woken up at Queenie's birthday party, she had seemed like a different person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not only had she become more beautiful, her stunning face could captivate anyone at first glance. Her bright eyes shone with intelligence and liveliness. Any man would fall for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Luna headed inside, but a concerned voice called out from behind them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana turned around and saw Alexander. Smiling brightly at him, she said, "Oh! Boss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander was dressed in a black suit, his restrained demeanor and sharp features making him look both serious and very handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander asked with concern, "Diana, I saw the livestream and rushed over. Are you okay? Were you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, just some scheming from those two. Something like that can't hurt me. She'll regret crossing me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From the day Diana decided to fight back, she had resolved to make Queenie pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie narrowed her eyes. Let's see what Diana could possibly do to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Queenie with a knowing smile. She had already won Cecil over to her side. With Harry in trouble, Queenie would be searching for her next loyal person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew about that boy. He was a genius.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, Diana wouldn't let Queenie get to him first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would find the boy before Queenie could and make him work for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their gazes met. Queenie's was full of venom, while Diana's smile was calm and composed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander glanced briefly at Steven and Queenie before turning to Diana again. "Diana, I brought you some food. Your brother said you didn't eat much for breakfast. The chef makes great breakfast. Let's try it together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, it's been dangerous for you lately. From now on, I'll take you to and from work. We're on the same route anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana nodded, feeling happy. Good food always warmed the heart, and Alexander's words were so considerate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thanks! Let's go eat in my office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander smiled warmly. "Sure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The three of them took the elevator upstairs, while Steven's eyes were filled with cold fury. She smiled so happily with Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He turned and went back into the office building across the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie tried to follow him, but Steven stopped her.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="148.html">« Prev</a><a href="150.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
