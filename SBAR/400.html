She stretched herself and then lay down again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She loved life on the island, and the blue sea was pleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One disadvantage of the seaside, though, was that it was too humid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;It was delightful to be here for a while. The sky and the sea were azure, and the wind was so refreshing. All the scenery was so charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After getting out of bed and washing up, Diana planned to blanch the seafood she had caught yesterday and invite Paige to come over for breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sent a message to Paige and then went to the kitchen. The kitchen was simple, with just an induction cooker and a microwave, so it was possible to cook seafood.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana went out with the snails. She was going to crack the shells and take out the meat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the door, she saw Steven, who was also about to go out. Perhaps it was because he was on the island that he was dressed in a very slim, light grey tracksuit, which made him energetic, handsome, and less formidable.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at him and then headed towards the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven noticed the seafood in her basin, which she had caught yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chased after her and asked, "Diana, when will you go back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Mr. Gellar, it's none of your business. I have nothing to do with you now. I came here just to relax. How come I keep bumping into you and Queenie everywhere? It's really unlucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you..." Steven glared at her. She was now rebellious and good at annoying him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He followed her into the elevator, suppressed his anger, and said, "Diana, I won't marry Queenie. Go back with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glared at him and wanted him to get away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Except for the divorce, I don't want to say another word to you. Mr. Gellar, you should have a backbone. Do not go back on your word. The day you threw the divorce agreement at me, it was you who told me never to go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned. Diana countered him with his previous statements.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gazed at her deeply. "That was just what I had said furiously. How long are you going to make such a fuss? I said I would not marry Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who you marry is none of my business. But your wife is unlucky because you will ignore her and give your mistress five million dollars in pocket money. I wonder who will be the next victim."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled meaningfully, "Diana, are you blaming me for not spending a penny on you? Well, starting this month, I can give you five million dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No! I haven't spent your money before, and I won't now. Save it for Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can earn money myself. I didn't even ask you for 100 million dollars for the medical expenses. I don't really need your money. You are not willing to engage in any financial entanglement with me, only to divorce me with ease and marry Queenie. Now that I've agreed to a divorce, you still target me. I don't know why people like you are so evil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are human beings, and so am I. Should I be perfectly submissive to you when you chase me away and ask me to come back to you? Steven, there is no one you have to love and nothing you have to do in this world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I also feel sad for myself for having adored someone like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Early in the morning, Diana's face turned pale with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Well, I won't go into the sea today. I'm quite upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No! Calm down. Irritation is harmful to my health."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes grew icy, and he said through gritted teeth, "Diana, do you dare to repeat it?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="399.html">« Prev</a><a href="401.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
