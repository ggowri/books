I have saved all the money you got from him. We will leave here together. After you get married, I will wait for you on the boat and then we will live on the island.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go to the hotel now. I miss you so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zorro took Elsie into the car and they drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Waiting for the car to leave, Diana and Cecil slowly stood up. Cecil was very angry. "Diana, they had an affair. Why did we suffer? My legs are sore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana also felt quite aggrieved. What did other people's affairs have to do with them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, Frank is cuckolded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was very excited. "If Frank knows about this, will he collapse from anger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at his excited look, Diana smiled, "No. Frank is a man who will tolerate the person he likes infinitely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is so stupid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. She was hungry. "I'm hungry. Didn't you say you would treat me to a meal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had already set up a plan for Frank to turn these four people into useless people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana just needed to wait and see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil said, "Let's go eat now. But I wonder why the people of the Marsh family and Steven are so stupid about these things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For example, Steven is very decisive in the business world, but why did he become so stupid when he encountered Queenie's matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "You know, once a man falls in love with someone, he will tolerate everything about her, including her shortcomings and viciousness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop! Diana, I'm not like that..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil suddenly thought of something and stopped talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still remembered that Queenie told him that it was Diana who framed his grandmother. That day, to vent Queenie's anger, he slapped Diana twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eh..." Cecil was confused. "Why was I stupid at that time? I believed everything Queenie said. What tricks did she play?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew that Cecil remembered the time when he hit her in the hospital, but she also made him very sad at the banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go. Let's not talk about the past." Diana was very calm now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil brought the matter up himself, and now he was very embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took Diana to the top floor to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hotel was decorated very luxuriously and the light music was pleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The aisles were full of flowers, very beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew this place, and its name was Colorful Restaurant. The food there was very delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was a little excited, "The steak here is delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil smiled, "I like it too. Let's order one later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and nodded. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them entered a private room. Steven and Evan also came here to see his father Andrew. Seeing Diana and Cecil enter the private room, Steven frowned. Were they also here to eat?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan didn't see that, and he said, "Mr. Gellar, let's go in quickly. Mr. Andrew Gellar has been waiting for us for an hour."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was afraid that Andrew would hit them with cups when they went in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Steven looked at the private room that Diana entered, he showed a gloomy expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven and Evan walked forward and entered the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bang..." A white cup smashed over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven and Evan quickly dodged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan lowered his head and smiled secretly. He knew that Andrew would be angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's face changed slightly. Pursing his lips, he looked at Andrew who was sitting opposite him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew looked very similar to Steven. Steven's mother Jenny was a great beauty, and Steven inherited the best qualities of his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Andrew was over 45 years old, he was still handsome, with a mature and restrained temperament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glared at Steven. "Steven, you made me wait for you for an hour?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="350.html">« Prev</a><a href="352.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
