"Joseph, I want to help you. But you&rsquo;re already hundreds of thousands of dollars in debts. Even if your grandmother has surgery, she can only live for one or two years. We have already reduced some of your medical expenses. But with your current arrears, we can't treat your grandmother anymore.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll ask the dean again tomorrow to see if I can continue to give her the drug for another week."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph Harrison lowered his head. His straight body seemed to have a bent spine. In the darkness, one could feel his deep pain and helplessness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana saw this scene, and her heart suddenly ached.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Dr. Cruz!" Joseph's voice was trembling. But more of it was helpless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been dependent on his grandmother since he was a child. He had thought of many ways and worked hard to make money. But he still could not earn enough money for his grandmother's surgery.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was familiar with Joseph's name. She seemed to have heard it somewhere.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Diana had already walked up to them. The moment she saw Joseph's handsome face, she was shocked. And her red lips even slightly opened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "He's Joseph, the genius young man who was beside Queenie in my previous life. It was because of him that Queenie defeated Steven."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana really wanted to scream. It was such a coincidence that she actually ran into him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that she had died tragically in her previous life, so many resources came to her in this life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked over and said, "Doctor, I can help his grandmother pay for the medical expenses. But I want to know what's wrong with her."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rowan said helplessly, "There is a tumor in her lung. But she is old, and it is dangerous to perform surgery."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked, "Can it be treated conservatively?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It also has great risks. It's mainly because our hospital does not have specific drugs."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rowan was also helpless. Not having medicine for patients was the most helpless thing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "If you are willing to pay the handling fee, pay it tomorrow morning."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Rowan left with the nurse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana helped Joseph stand up, seeing his handsome face full of tears. He wiped away his tears violently.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His sunny and handsome appearance was as evil as Cecil's. But his eyes were clear. Diana didn't understand why such an excellent boy would help Queenie to do evil.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did Queenie use the life-saving grace of his Grandmother?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought, "It doesn't matter if we can't be friends in this life, as long as we won't become enemies."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's mood eased a little. He stared at Diana's beautiful face. "Miss, are you really willing to help me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was willing, as long as they wouldn't become enemies.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "In the future, he will be a big shot in the technology industry. Queenie used her false kindness to surround herself with many talented people. So her company developed better and better."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Yes! I am willing to help you. But I will see your grandmother first because I am also a doctor. Your Grandmother is old, and I will see if she can be treated conservatively. If she can, I will find medicine for her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If she can't, let's transfer her to Tanaxes Hospital in Capitole. I own that hospital. Your grandmother can get free treatment there."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph was touched. He had just turned 18 this year and had already used up all of his grandmother's savings. His part-time job was far from enough to cover the expensive medical expenses.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But having worked at such a young age, he knew that there was no free lunch in this world.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked Diana, "My name is Joseph Harrison. What do you want me to do?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well..." Diana didn't react for a moment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him in surprise and asked, "So what do you want to do for me?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="341.html">« Prev</a><a href="343.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
