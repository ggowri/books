"Diana, was it you who framed me?" he demanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana remained speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil frowned, his alluring eyes darkening as he glared at Jeff. "You bastard, did the butler's words go in one ear and out the other? Diana's been with me since she got here, eating together and helping the butler with things outside. Why is your family so awful that whenever something goes wrong, you immediately blame Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whenever you need someone to blame, you target Diana. Even though she was your family's adopted daughter, Queenie staged a fake kidnapping to frame her at her birthday party, leading Diana to cut all ties with your family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your whole family is truly vile. You're always trying to make her take the fall. As long as I'm here, you can forget about getting away with this, you coward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff furrowed his brows. This brat... why was he defending Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But who else here would frame me besides her?" Jeff argued insistently. He was determined to pin this on Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil let out a cold laugh, his eyes filled with sinister intent. He pointed at the surveillance camera above. "If you want to know if you were framed, why not just check the footage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's reminder jolted everyone into realization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was startled. He had walked into the room on his own. He remembered it clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Diana stepped forward, looking at Jace with grievance and shock. "Mr. Foliot, for my innocence, please check the footage to clear my name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"These people have insulted and framed me at your event without any evidence, which is also a disrespect to you." Diana's tone was firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was resolute in her stance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie and Penelope liked these dramatic games, didn't they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, it was best to take it seriously and see it through to the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie calmly looked at Diana and Cecil. She knew the cameras were already disabled. She was curious to see how Diana planned to prove her innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace turned to the butler and said, "Take us to the surveillance room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group marched toward the surveillance room in a grand procession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surveillance room was right behind them, not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jace entered, the manager was shocked and quickly stood up, smiling obsequiously. "Mr. Foliot, a call would've sufficed. What brings you here personally?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace glanced coldly at Diana. "I'm here to check the surveillance. Rewind it to when this gentleman entered the room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The manager looked at Jeff, then quickly located the footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was stunned to see the footage. It was impossible. She had personally destroyed the cameras. How could there still be video?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The video showed a slightly overweight woman entering the room, followed by Jeff hesitating, glancing around, and then quickly pushing the door open. Meanwhile, Diana was outside helping the butler with flower arrangements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd's gaze toward Jeff shifted instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff's face turned pale and grim. He hadn't expected there to be actual footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Jace, her tone cold and ethereal. "Mr. Foliot, it was Jeff who walked in on his own. I didn't frame him. Jeff tried to use you to punish me, so I had no choice but to prove my innocence. I appreciate your help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was stunned and leaned toward Diana, stuttering angrily, "You... ungrateful girl... you..."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="201.html">« Prev</a><a href="203.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
