The bird's nest runs out. Should I go buy more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen looked outside and smirked, "In this heavy snow, I don't need that bowl of bird's nest. Stay and have breakfast at home. If others find out, they'll think I'm mistreating you. You're getting older now, a fall could be dangerous. It's hard to get back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so reckless. Just go have breakfast. Today's breakfast is really rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every breakfast here was always rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pondered the underlying meaning of Helen's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora grew more anxious. "Madam Gellar, I really have an urgent matter. My son was knocked over by a scooter on his way to work. I need to go to the hospital to check on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen looked regretful. "Well then, go ahead. Today, I've prepared your favorite bird's nest. You always take half of mine. Look at your face, so shiny and smooth. Your skin's getting better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora stared in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only helped Helen share the bird's nest because it was always too much for one person to finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It cost tens of thousands of dollars a pound, and Helen never ate it all, so she took a few bites to avoid waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time, Helen would leave half for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora huffed, "Madam Gellar, you're making me sound like a thief. How could I steal your bird's nest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it were true, she would never admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen finished the last spoonful of bird's nest, then put down her spoon. The bird's nest was good, and she planned to give Diana some later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was tasty and good for the skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at Zora and said, "Zora, whether you stole it or not, you know the answer. You used my money to buy a villa, gave your son a fixed deposit, and lived off the interest. What's that if not stealing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was stern. Zora was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen slowly stood up. She was thin, but her elaborate clothes made her appear even more imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "Zora, over the years, I've treated you well. Why are you doing this to me? You stole so many of my jewelry and sold them. Then you bought a villa for your son and put millions of dollars into his account for him to live off the interest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora realized Helen had uncovered everything. She stopped pretending. "Old fool, after all these years of serving you, why can't I take some of your money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're almost at the end of your life, and those things mean nothing to you. Don't I deserve something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she couldn't keep those things, she would fight Helen to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen had seen countless greedy people. To her, Zora was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Gellar family was rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said calmly, "Zora, you're paid to work. Anything you take beyond your salary doesn't belong to you. We've treated you well, but you've taken advantage of us. Now, it's time to cut our losses. The villa you bought is in a good location. I'm not losing out. I've gained from it. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora panicked, not knowing what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She argued, "Madam Gellar, you don't need money, but that villa is my son's life. Please, don't do this. I was wrong. Please let us go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped Helen would let them off this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Helen to know about not only the lost jewelry but also the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen sneered, walking toward Zora. "I don't need money, but I won't tolerate traitors. Do you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold wind blew through the room, and her gray hair fluttered, making her look dignified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded like Helen had discovered her deal with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora turned and ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen shook her head. She could've given Zora money to retire peacefully, but Zora had taken so much from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora was greedy and ungrateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the door to find two policemen, followed by Diana and Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora froze, knowing she was done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Helen and shouted, "Madam Gellar, are you trying to kill me? We've been like sisters for all these years. And now, over something so small, you want to send me to jail?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People like us, living at the bottom, have to rely on opportunities like this. I spent my whole life serving you and never had time to learn a skill. It's been tough, hasn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to serve the old couple with all her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Queenie returned, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was ambitious, and that ambition made her greedy too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie even had a plan to push Helen down the stairs to frame Diana, but the plan was stopped by other matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Queenie had acted sooner, she wouldn't be in this situation now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen shook her head. "Zora, I never wanted you dead. You're the one who wanted me dead. Don't you remember poisoning me with slow-acting poison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora trembled. "What poison? I don't understand. Madam Gellar, you can't blame me for everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything?" Steven snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his phone, showing Zora a video from just a few minutes ago. It was a video of her making a phone call in the garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zora, my grandmother treated you well, but you've repaid kindness with betrayal. You can go with the police now. It's almost Christmas, and the Gellar family doesn't like this kind of chaos during the holiday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had wanted Zora gone for a while. He had been wondering what Queenie would use her for, but now it didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Zora, Queenie would buy others, but that was no longer his concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie could no longer reach this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora's face contorted in pain as she looked at Steven. "Mr. Gellar, you're no better. No wonder you'll never find happiness in this life. You're blind and heartless. You treat the woman who cares for you like dirt and treasure some mistress outside. Even if I go to jail, I'll watch you fall from grace."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="882.html">« Prev</a><a href="884.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
