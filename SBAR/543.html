If this matter were to be made public, the drama she was currently filming would be ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, aren't you going to do anything?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven then looked at Diana and said, "Diana, can you stop being such a bitch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words again, Diana's breath hitched slightly, and her heart was deeply wounded. These words made Diana's eyes turn red with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I the one being a bitch? Wasn't it you who started this farce? If the two of you scoundrels can go out to eat together, why can't I sit and have a meal with my friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Encountering them, Diana was also very angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really, really hated to see them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly grabbed her hand and said, "Come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at him. "Don't touch me with your dirty hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered. "You're more dirty than me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was extremely disgusted with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me. The pictures Queenie sent to me make me feel sick just looking at the two of you. If you don't let go, I'll make those photos public," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, the only reason I haven't exposed your relationship is out of respect for Grandma, so get your hands off me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana struggled hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, however, was greatly alarmed. She had previously sent the photos to provoke Diana, and she had kept them, even showing them to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, how can you be so despicable?" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana responded to Queenie hard with another slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah...Bitch, how dare you hit me again?" Queenie's eyes widened with anger as she glared at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, looking at her vicious expression, smiled and reminded her, "Queenie, pay attention to the image you usually portray. In front of Steven, you are supposed to be a gentle and kind woman. Your current behavior exposes your true nature."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! You crazy bitch! I will kill you." Queenie yelled in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was startled by her maniacal appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were even more terrifying things waiting for her; she couldn't handle this already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned as he looked at Queenie's maniacal appearance, his brows slightly knitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her appearance had nothing to do with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come back with me, Diana. Don't make me deal with you with laws," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised her eyebrows and smiled happily. "Then go ahead! Just give it a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that this dinner was ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Alexander and said, "Alexander, I'm sorry you didn't get to have dinner. Why don't you come to my place? I'll make dinner for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since arriving at this restaurant, she had only taken one bite of meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled gently, "Alright! I heard from Sir Bishop that you make really delicious food."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go." Diana tried to shake off Steven's hand but failed to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him with a frown. "Take your hands back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, however, tightened his grip on her hand. "Are you planning to take him home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does it have to do with you? Your darling is crying so hard she's nearly out of breath. Go comfort her quickly, or if something bad happens to her, don't blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please disappear from my sight right now," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Steven, who already had a rather short temper, now felt a dull pain in his stomach from anger. "Diana, how can you be so vulgar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered, finding his words laughable. "That's what you should get. Weren't the two of you being vulgar first? I'm just giving as good as I get; what's wrong with that?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="542.html">« Prev</a><a href="544.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
