It was his stunning looks that had made her fall for him at first sight.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But then she remembered that Jeff was on his way, and she quickly said, &quot;Enough! I need to go see the real drama.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, she turned and hurried out the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven watched her go, a hint of a resigned smile playing on his lips.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Back when they first got married, he had been completely powerless, crippled and blind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After he healed, Queenie&#x27;s return had only made things more awkward between him and Diana. Even though they were married, they slept in separate rooms.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It wasn&#x27;t about loyalty. It was just the mess his father had left behind with his countless affairs and illegitimate children. Steven had never been one for romance. His heart was as clear as it was unyielding.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No matter how provocatively Queenie dressed or how close she got, he felt nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But with Diana, it was a different story. He felt a strong urge to be with her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He followed Diana outside and soon arrived at Amelie&#x27;s room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The door was ajar, and he could hear Jeff&#x27;s angry voice inside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Amelie, is this how low you&#x27;ve sunk? Can&#x27;t you survive without a man?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I left Paula for you, and now you want to cheat? How could you betray my love after all these years?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s heart raced as she listened. It was obvious what was happening.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie came out, her clothes askew and fury written all over her face. &quot;Jeff, I&#x27;ve wanted out for ages! I&#x27;m marrying Mark tomorrow, and we&#x27;re getting a divorce! I was blind to fall for a loser like you. You&#x27;ve got nothing now. You don&#x27;t deserve me. Can&#x27;t you see that?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff&#x27;s bitter smile showed his self-loathing; he knew he had brought this on himself by abandoning Paula, who had truly cared for him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Living with Amelie had led to a total disaster.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She&#x27;d always kept a backup plan, and now that he was broke, she looked down on him even more.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But he couldn&#x27;t act against Mark, whose business was booming.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mark would go to great lengths to be with Amelie, even if it meant taking drastic actions.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Both of them were ruthless, and he believed they would eventually get what was coming to them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a cunning grin, Jeff said, &quot;If you want her so badly, Mr. Foliot, then fine. I&#x27;ll divorce her tomorrow and let you have her.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A flicker of calculation flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie stared at him, disbelief written all over her face. &quot;Are you really willing to divorce me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t imagine he would want to leave, especially since he had nothing left and needed her and their son to survive.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a narrowed smile, Jeff nodded earnestly. &quot;Yep! Amelie, forcing things never brings happiness. I&#x27;ve never felt happy with you. You&#x27;re lazy and messy...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Shut it, Jeff! You think this is all my fault? If you could actually pay for a maid, I wouldn&#x27;t have to do everything myself! I don&#x27;t have time to look good!&quot; Amelie shot back, her temper flaring.</p><p style="text-align:left;">How dare he complain about her? If it weren&#x27;t for their daughter&#x27;s help, he wouldn&#x27;t even have what he has today. He should be grateful instead of throwing shade at her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At that moment, Jeff truly saw Amelie&#x27;s selfishness. She was just as mercenary as Queenie, caring only about money.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sure, you&#x27;re not exactly focused on your looks. Mr. Foliot, tomorrow I&#x27;ll hand her over to you,&quot; he said, turning to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Wait!&quot; Mark snapped, anger boiling over.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Between men, there was a fierce pride when it came to women, and right now, Mark was determined to keep Amelie by his side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff raised an eyebrow, intrigued. &quot;What&#x27;s up? You got more to say, Mr. Foliot?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A cold smile crossed Mark&#x27;s lips. &quot;Jeff, you&#x27;ve ruined my fun, and now you think you can just walk away?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="796.html">« Prev</a><a href="798.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
