Mr. Gellar, you can say the words, but I can't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she said, "Steven, now everyone thinks that Queenie is your wife. Can you keep a distance from her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven answered her just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath and did not refute, thinking, "After she took revenge, would she never mention the previous events again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmed down and said, "I'll leave the car to you. Go back by yourself later. Be careful. I noticed someone following you last night. Try to go to crowded places and go back early."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven left after speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Diana was stunned. Someone followed her last night?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Steven's leaving back and frowned. Steven insisted on following her last night because he was afraid that she would get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed at herself. If she died, his agreement would become invalid. Steven certainly didn't want to see the benefits that were within his grasp lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath and didn't think much about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Cecil was about to wake up, she left quickly. After all, it was easy for a man and a woman alone to be misunderstood. She stayed only because Cecil was not very clear-headed last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana left. Cecil opened his eyes. He smiled and thought Diana became shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was also afraid. In his dream, Queenie had his legs broken, his arms chopped off, and he was thrown into the sea. He remembered the date. It was last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He died on November 27th in winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, a scary man appeared in the dream, and he was standing with his back to Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was that man?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil felt it both magical and terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled maliciously and told him the truth, "Cecil, you idiot. I just used a little trick to make your entire family mine. Your family, a century-old family, was destroyed in your hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bully whoever I tell you to. You are such an obedient and sensible dog. I can't bear to kill you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what I'm even more reluctant to part with is your wealth. When you got into the accident, your grandmother must have died of rage. Your father's car accident abroad a few years ago was also arranged by me. Now you only have your mother. I will find a reason to send your mother to hell to accompany you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who I hate the most? Diana. You help me bully her every time you meet, making her afraid of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot. Diana reminded you to be careful of me despite past grudges. But no matter what she said, you didn't believe her and only believed me. You are a loyal dog."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie kicked his bloody body.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk! After a while, I will send Diana to hell to accompany you. Remember to help me bully Diana severely in hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was angry and regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was dying, and all his limbs were broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately looked at the sea and made a wish. "Queenie, if there is an afterlife, I will make you live a life worse than death."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dream ended here.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know that he had bullied Diana before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for that dream, he would have no idea that he had bullied Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only in a dream that Queenie mentioned it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, ah..." Cecil was in pain, because it hurt and he was scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men got scared, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men were ordinary people, too. They could be timid.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was really scared last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one possibility as to why Diana knew what happened to him. Both Diana and he carried memories of their previous lives.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="671.html">« Prev</a><a href="673.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
