Her ponytail bounced as she moved, and a radiant smile lit up her delicate face. She was practically glowing, jumping with joy. She had always been this captivating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be waiting for you to catch that tuna for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was overjoyed; she loved the ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked, "Diana, do you remember that time I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let you wear that gorgeous dress?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a surge of anger at the memory. Why would he bring that up? She still remembered how awful his tone was back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She snapped, "Yes, the things you did to me, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll remember them for a lifetime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said guiltily, "Honestly, I was being selfish. I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want anyone else to see how beautiful you are. If you dressed up, Queenie would be even more jealous and scheme against you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honestly, I can</span><span>'</span><span>t stand your birth mother or your four brothers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s own parents didn</span><span>'</span><span>t love him either. Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s birth mother was even more vicious, and he despised her even more. He never treated Paula kindly, unless it was all for show.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I hate them too. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t bring them up in front of me again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Steven smiled and continued walking with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three days later, the temperature rose, the weather cleared, and the sea was calm. Diana couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t resist the urge to go fishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After lunch and a short rest, she changed into her wetsuit, put on her diving mask, grabbed her spear, and headed toward the beach with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the shore, Diana looked at Steven. "Steven, wait for me over there. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be back in an hour&mdash;no, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll come back as soon as I catch a bluefin tuna."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she was an excellent diver, but he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t familiar with these waters. He was still worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Alright. Diana, be careful. When summer comes, teach me how to dive, will you? Watching you dive so freely makes me want to learn too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and nodded. "Sure! I</span><span>'</span><span>ll go catch some fish first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she walked toward the depths of the ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her swim toward the deep sea, like a mermaid, and smiled. He wished he could stay here forever, untouched by the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana loved diving. The water here was crystal clear. As soon as she dove in, she spotted a fish. There were plenty back home, but what she really wanted was a bluefin tuna. She was craving sashimi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also spotted a few shrimp, but they were too quick to catch. So, she gave up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weather was nice today. She swam toward the area with the most coral.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven waited for Diana on the shore, fishing as he passed the time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the warm sunlight, Steven kept smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten minutes later, he caught a fish. Its blue scales shimmered beautifully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven tossed the fish into the bucket and baited the hook again. He lounged lazily in his chair, waiting for another bite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He watched Diana in the distance. She surfaced for air several times but didn</span><span>'</span><span>t bother to greet him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching her dive back into the water, he frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, Steven had caught a few fish and even hooked a tree root. Thinking it was a big fish, he pulled hard, only to realize it was just a root.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the fish in the bucket with satisfaction. These would be enough to last them for days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Diana swam back. Seeing her struggling with a heavy fishing net, Steven quickly went over to help her carry it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was furious. She pulled off her diving mask, panting. "Steven, let me tell you, I caught three bluefin tuna. But there were three sharks over there. When I dove back down, they ate them all. I</span><span>'</span><span>m so mad!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed her face was flushed with anger, but his concern grew&mdash;had she been surrounded by sharks?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, it</span><span>'</span><span>s okay if the fish are gone. Are you hurt?" Steven grabbed her, checking her over. "I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know there</span><span>'</span><span>d be sharks around here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No, I</span><span>'</span><span>m fine. I could</span><span>'</span><span>ve caught a yellowfin tuna. Such a shame."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the remaining catch&mdash;two tuna and a lobster as thick as her arm. She felt pretty satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, on my way back, I ran into two big tuna," Diana said with a smile. Her mood always shifted so quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lifted the fish in her hand and said, "Let</span><span>'</span><span>s head back and change."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Sure! The water</span><span>'</span><span>s a bit cold. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to help Steven carry the stuff, but he wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let her. He grabbed the fish and picked up the fishing rod. The two of them started walking back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at the villa, Diana went to the bathroom. After her shower, she dried her hair and headed downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was sitting in the living room, sipping coffee. When he saw her come down, he pulled her to sit on the couch with him. "Diana, sit down and have some coffee."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was exhausted. Swimming back, those three sharks had kept their eyes on the fish in her hand, wearing her out completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I</span><span>'</span><span>m going to take a nap. Wake me up in the afternoon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled her up again. "I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t sleep well last night. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s nap together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned at him. "Didn</span><span>'</span><span>t sleep well last night? You seemed to be sleeping just fine to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her intently. Diana looked back at him, her face emotionless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a helpless smile, his voice slightly hoarse yet irresistibly alluring. "Diana, what do you take me for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked. "A human, of course!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t quite understand what he meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t see him as a man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you sleep so deeply. I could lie next to you all night and leave in the morning, and you</span><span>'</span><span>d never know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smirked. "Diana, I</span><span>'</span><span>m a man. When you</span><span>'</span><span>re asleep, that</span><span>'</span><span>s when I want you the most. It</span><span>'</span><span>s torture, but I have to hold back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face turned bright red instantly. She understood what he meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had thought she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t attractive, that Steven felt nothing lying next to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana heard the words she had longed for. So, she was an attractive woman after all. Steven did feel something for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face, usually pale from his injury, flushed red at this moment too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said nothing and turned to head upstairs. Though they were married, they had never been intimate. Talking about it made her feel shy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her retreating figure with a slight smile and followed her upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed he needed to speed up his plan. Thinking about Alexander's call made him furious. He wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let Alexander take his wife away.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1104.html">« Prev</a><a href="1106.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
