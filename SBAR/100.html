His breath must smell good, or Paula would be repulsed.</span><span> Also</span><span>, his body couldn't smell of sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I do miss Queenie's mother, who is able to tolerate everything about me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was different with Paula. He had to bathe every day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, he must wash his feet daily to keep them clean. And </span><span>also</span><span> his breath had to be fresh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff rinsed his mouth several times until he felt much better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had eaten food with strong flavor tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was some odor within his mouth inevitably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He squeezed out more toothpaste and brushed his teeth vigorously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bathing and applying perfume, he didn't miss a single step.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He came out, finding Paula lying on the bed. She obviously had finished drinking the tonic and removing her face mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff joyfully got into bed to hold Paula. Ah... Her figure was still the best. Didn't expect her to be this good-shaped after giving birth to five children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula forced a smile, trying to suppress her disgust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff exclaimed excitedly, "Paula, I miss you so much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leaned in to kiss her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula turned away in revulsion. She had witnessed him dating that woman in person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed even more comfortable there than at home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That woman seemed to have taken very good care of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did they indulge in passionate lovemaking at home, but cooked and went shopping together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff would change his appearance by wearing a wig, a pair of glasses, a mask, and casual clothes he never wore in his daily life. No wonder she failed to notice his betrayal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scoundrel was far too good at covering up his misbehavior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were dark circles under his eyes, clearly from overindulgence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me what you've been up to these days when I wasn't at home," Paula said coolly, her eyes tinged with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff, adept at dealing with her, replied, "I was busy every day, of course."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Busy with dating that woman. Huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula pretended to show her concern. "You must be exhausted, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff shook his head. "It's worth it for my family and our bright future."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's gaze shimmered with mockery. "What a liar! It's all for your own future."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff had been living off her over the years. Shame on her to have molded him into a respectable wealthy man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to make love to Paula and made quite an effort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Embarrassingly, his manhood lacked its usual vigor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He obviously felt aroused. But why couldn't he perform?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quite anxious, he actually found Paula became more beautiful at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his prolonged inaction, Paula asked with a frown, "Darling, are you too tired? Should we just forget it for tonight? I'm exhausted, too, after hours on a plane and working late last night."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, she had discovered that her assistant was also working for Jeff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During these days since her return, she had her other trusted assistant impersonate her. Only by returning with them together this morning did she manage to avoid others' suspicion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unwilling to give up, Jeff tried hard to arouse Paula, but to no avail. What a failure!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff felt mortified. Why was this happening? Had he overexerted himself these days with Queenie's mother? Had he been overdosed and become impotent?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="99.html">« Prev</a><a href="101.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
