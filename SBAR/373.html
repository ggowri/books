So she didn't know Queenie's natural mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie reminded Jeff, "Dad, we have to speed up our plan, or we will be burdened with debt. Paula's company is in a worse and worse condition. After Azure Group recalled its investment, there were no new investors. Now the company is in a poor condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff said, "You secretly transferred a large sum of money, which made it difficult for Paula's company to operate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie whispered, "Dad, keep your voice down. Paula hasn't discovered it yet. I have invested that money in real estate in Woodston. I can make a lot of money by then. Paula can't find this loophole for the time being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She bought me a lot of dresses yesterday. She is still very nice to me." Queenie's eyes were full of disdain. No matter how well Paula treated Queenie, she was not Queenie's biological mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie continued, "Dad, I don't want to become the daughter of a mistress. Can you divorce Paula as quickly as possible and take over the company? Paula's parents have a lot of property. Try to find a way to get their money and give it all to my mom. That's the compensation for my mom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff frowned. "You are crazy. Paula's mother doesn't like me at all. It's impossible for me to deceive her and get her money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula's parents have looked down on me all my life. I have tried not to see them in the past two years. But you actually want me to cheat them out of their money. I'm not that stupid to head for my doom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff had been in a bad mood recently because he became impotent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie frowned. Seeing that there were many people around, she stopped talking about it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was unreliable, so she had to do it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie wore a smile and greeted the guests with Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away, Paula wore sunglasses and stood on the second floor with her assistant, Elina, standing next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They saw Queenie and Jeff entering the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elina had worked for Paula for many years. She asked, "Frank is getting married today. Are you really not going to attend it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula smiled, "Let's go and have fun. Something interesting is going to happen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elina nodded and followed Paula into the wedding venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding venue was decorated romantically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie's parents did not come, and Frank was a little unhappy. Elsie said that her father broke his leg while working in the field, and her mother had to stay at home to take care of her father, so they could not come to the wedding. Marriage was a matter between the couple, and it didn't matter if her parents were absent. Her excuse convinced Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests had all arrived. As the wedding march sounded, the host let the bride and groom come in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank held Elsie's hand and slowly walked on the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he didn't feel happy at all and even didn't want to get married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Somehow, he always thought of Paige's lovely face, her tearful eyes, and her angry look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was a little absent-minded. When he reached the host, he suddenly saw Paige and Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige had lost weight and become more beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the bride and groom, the guests applauded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank and Elsie followed the host's instructions and entered the ring-wearing session.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had no smile on his face throughout the process, and he glanced at Paige in the audience from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige looked at him with a smile, without any sadness at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile seemed to be gloating about Frank. Before Frank had time to think about it, Elsie found that he was in a low mood and pinched his arm hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie looked at Paige in the audience and warned Frank, "Frank, it is our wedding. Why are you pulling a long face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank took one last look at Paige before he turned his head. After exchanging rings, the video was playing on the big screen behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unexpectedly, it was a video of Elsie hugging and kissing another man.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="372.html">« Prev</a><a href="374.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
