It turned out that Queenie had not been lying this time &ndash; she was truly in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Surveying the surroundings, Diana squinted as she recognized it was near Steven's villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's message popped up: [Diana, Queenie is much more cunning than we've ever known. She even killed Callie to win the champ.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was unaware that Queenie had won the championship in the piano competition because of Callie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her mind, Queenie was always a skilled pianist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She responded to Cecil: [Stay alert. She's been training assassins in secret. Queenie is resourceful and excellent in everything.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil replied: [Diana, you think too highly of her. How can a ruthless woman like her be deemed excellent? She's just good at disguise and seduction.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew that he had underestimated Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She replied: [Cecil, I'm serious. Consider the incidents in your company and think about why your overseas father met with a car accident. These aren't easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Queenie wouldn't have done those things without meticulous planning. There are unseen forces backing her. Her current focus is on Steven, a member of Capitole's most powerful family. Marrying him would improve her status, helping her move up.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil replied: [Yeah, you have a point. She's so scary.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied: [Never underestimate women.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil replied: [I saw her trembling, and I thought she was an easy target.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied: [Alright. Good night.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana then tossed her phone aside and went to wash up, prepared for bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frustrated by Steven's sudden decision not to divorce, she just wanted to be alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Leopold and Tobias absent, the villa was quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Diana lay down, she quickly fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had another nightmare, where she dreamed that in a past life, she was bound in an unfinished building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She witnessed helplessly how those people hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of pain contorted her face, and the axe smashed down on her fingers, causing her to be overcome with sheer terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The most excruciating moment came when Steven pushed her down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She exclaimed, "No, Steven, please, save me. Save our child..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Steven disregarded her plea. Suddenly, blood splattered on the ground, and she saw herself reduced to a mass of flesh and blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No..." Diana jolted awake, drenched in sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains, she realized it was just a nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gasped for air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pain was so intense that she curled up in agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her phone kept ringing. Diana reached out to get it. Without checking the caller ID, she answered, "Hello."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, how dare you? You actually hired men to kidnap Queenie. Are you trying to get yourself killed?" came a man's scolding.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="281.html">« Prev</a><a href="283.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
