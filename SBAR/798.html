As a man, he understood all too well how uncomfortable it was to be interrupted during sex.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the reality was - Mark was in bed with his woman.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Foliot, Amelie is still my woman. If your wife&#x27;s mother finds out about this, do you think she&#x27;ll still give you those shares?&quot; Jeff threatened, fully aware that Mark was the type to ride on the coattails of others.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mark was a nobody in his own family. That was why he had married Lily, leveraging her family&#x27;s influence to secure his place.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They were both cut from the same cloth, and Jeff knew how to handle someone like him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mark glared back, his expression icy. &quot;Then slap yourself twice and you can leave.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?!&quot; Jeff was taken aback, not expecting such a ridiculous demand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mark smirked. &quot;What&#x27;s the problem? You interrupted my little moment, and now you want to walk away? Just slap yourself. Is that too much to ask?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Anger boiled in Jeff&#x27;s chest, but he felt completely powerless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At that moment, he realized he was nothing but a failure.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Without Paula, he was reduced to nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He used to be Paula&#x27;s husband, respected by others.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now he felt like a washed-up loser.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Can&#x27;t handle it? You&#x27;re seriously not going to slap yourself?&quot; Mark taunted, enjoying every second of Jeff&#x27;s humiliation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thrived on manipulating people, just like he did with Lily, who was blindly devoted to him while he took advantage of her family&#x27;s business, treating her with contempt.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was a comfortable life, and he lived like a king.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now that Lily was away, he felt a strange emptiness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had plenty of women on the side, but Amelie was his favorite, fun, lively, and good at keeping him entertained.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His clueless wife had no idea, and watching her innocent devotion made him smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, to toy with Jeff&#x27;s woman and force him to slap himself was pure joy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mark, you&#x27;ll get what&#x27;s coming to you,&quot; Jeff muttered, his face twisted in anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But he complied and slapped himself twice, the sting barely registering compared to his fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie watched in disbelief as he struck himself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The proud man who once wouldn&#x27;t back down from anything was now reduced to this. He&#x27;d even abandoned his daughter without a second thought, yet here he was, obeying Mark&#x27;s command.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jeff, you really are pathetic,&quot; she sneered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff turned to Mark, his face darkening. &quot;I&#x27;ve done what you asked. Can I leave now?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yeah, just get lost!&quot; Mark waved him off, clearly bored with the whole encounter. He thought Jeff was completely spineless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Filled with humiliation, Jeff left in a hurry.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As he reached the door, fury surged within him, and he turned back, his eyes blazing with anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">From a distance, Diana and Steven could see every bit of his fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was practically bouncing with excitement. &quot;Wow! Steven, your fiancée&#x27;s dad really is something! How come they didn&#x27;t end up in a fight?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven looked down at her, his tone steady. &quot;He&#x27;s still your dad, you know.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shook her head, a frown creasing her forehead. &quot;No way! I just feel like I&#x27;m not really his daughter. We don&#x27;t look anything alike! With my genes, there&#x27;s no way I could be Jeff&#x27;s kid.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="797.html">« Prev</a><a href="799.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
