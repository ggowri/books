"Diana can't forget me. I'm the one she pulled out of that car, out of the fire, when she was 18. She can't forget that. I'm her first love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew this for sure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Diana had really wanted something with Alexander, she would have had it by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Alexander's actions, the way he was coming on so strong&mdash;it pissed Steven off. No matter how cold or indifferent a person was, if he pushed hard enough, they'd eventually crack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan raised an eyebrow, eyeing Steven with disbelief. Was he serious? Was Steven really this full of himself? Did he think he was some kind of legend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did he honestly think his charm was invincible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure, Steven could use his looks to his advantage and fool Diana into thinking he was the one, but his approach was completely out of touch with reality. He didn't get it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar," Evan said, his voice cutting through the tension, "you really need to stop deluding yourself. Mrs. Gellar has had her heart broken by you already. She's done. You might want to face the truth, man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was trying to snap Steven out of his self-obsession, to show him how blind he was when it came to Diana. He couldn't stand how Steven was handling things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The truth was, Diana had given Steven everything&mdash;her heart, her soul, her love, burning like a fire in the sun&mdash;only for him to completely ignore it. He didn't see it, and that love had been extinguished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Steven thought he was protecting her from Andrew, the damage he'd already done to Diana was done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's face tightened. He didn't say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, he lowered his head and quietly chewed on a turkey leg, waiting for Diana to come out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was sharp&mdash;she'd already figured out that Steven was alive and well, still running the company. He could tell by the way she carried herself that a part of her still held onto him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Alexander's place, the moment Diana stepped inside, he led her straight to the dining room, where dinner was already set up&mdash;everything prepared in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was just Diana, Alexander, and Luna for dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was a seafood lover, and the table was overflowing with all sorts of fresh, perfectly cooked seafood&mdash;its colors, scents, and flavors were enough to make anyone's mouth water. Diana dug in happily, savoring every bite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Diana handed Alexander the documents detailing their artificial intelligence medical system and her ideas for its development.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander," she began, her voice steady but eager, "we're almost ready to go public with this system. If you're willing to help us make connections with international partners, we're willing to offer a two-point profit share in return."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd come to Alexander today not just for personal reasons, but to discuss business. She knew that getting this project on the table would help settle the nerves of the company's shareholders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The technical challenges they were facing had Tom working overtime, tweaking and improving the system. Every night, Diana and Tom discussed the progress, and with Joseph's help, what had started as a rough concept was now a polished, fully developed product.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked at the proposal Diana handed him, a smile curling up at the corners of his lips. He reached out and took the papers from her, his expression warm and gentle. "Diana," he said, his voice soft and reassuring, "it's Christmas break. Take some time to enjoy the holidays. But after the holidays, even if you don't reach out to me, I'll come to you. Your company has already perfected this technology, and I'd love to see us work together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a rush of excitement. She'd always known that to make a truly impactful, profitable partnership, she needed to bring something real to the table&mdash;something that would knock people's socks off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The road ahead was long, and full of obstacles, but she had no choice now. There was no turning back&mdash;only forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, thank you so much for your support!" she said, her voice full of gratitude and enthusiasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gazed deeply at her radiant smile, his eyes soft and full of warmth. "Diana, there's no need to be so formal. When it comes to business, even if you don't come to me, I'll come to you. Besides, our partnership will be a win-win for both of us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He leaned back slightly, a knowing smile playing at the edges of his lips. "Your fashion designs helped me secure my place in the Powell family. Your blueprints made me a fortune this year. My parents are thrilled, and my uncles and aunts&mdash;they saw this year's performance, and now, at Christmas', they treat me with respect. They don't belittle me like they used to. Now, when they see me, it's all compliments and smiles."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana understood. Life in a wealthy family was cold and calculating, with little warmth to be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I could help you in any way, I'm glad," she said. "Since you're not busy right now, why not take a look at the plans? If you have any questions, I can walk you through them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing how eager she was, Alexander couldn't help but chuckle, "Alright, alright, I'll look at them now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shifted in his seat, placing the documents on his lap, and began reading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana watched him, her smile slipping onto her face as she took in the sight of the handsome man so focused on his work. There was something undeniably captivating about a man like him when he was completely absorbed in what he was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His head was slightly lowered, the tousled hair at his brow partially obscuring those deep, ocean-like eyes. His fingers moved with grace as he flipped through the pages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The light from the overhead lamps accentuated the sharp lines of his profile, casting the contours of his face in perfect relief. His lips curled into the faintest smile, as if he knew he had her attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't help herself. She leaned forward, resting her chin on her hands as she watched him, unable to pull her gaze away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes burned with intensity, a look so obvious that Alexander couldn't possibly ignore it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly lifted his head, their gazes locking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana froze, caught off guard by the sudden shift. She quickly dropped her eyes, embarrassed, not daring to meet his stare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm..." Alexander chuckled softly, his voice low and teasing. "Diana, if you want to look at me, you can do it openly. No need to hide it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face turned crimson, like the soft glow of a sunset&mdash;warm and radiant. He'd caught her, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no denying it&mdash;beautiful things were hard to look away from. And he, undeniably, was the kind of beauty that stirred her heart and made her want to take in every inch of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Heh..." Diana let out an awkward laugh, pulling out her phone as a distraction. She didn't want to get caught staring again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was embarrassing enough as it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Alexander saw Diana pull out her phone, he immediately regretted teasing her earlier. He pretended not to notice, hoping she'd continue to focus on him and his every move without realizing he was watching her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A small, playful smile tugged at the corner of his lips. Having her close felt... nice. Really nice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Diana wasn't exactly idle either. She was still working, texting with Tom about business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, even beggars need a break at Christmas. It's only the second day of Christmas. Can't you let me sleep in peace for once?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Tom, you've been sleeping for three days straight.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[I've been pulling all-nighters for weeks. Can't I give my liver a break? You know I only get decent sleep during Christmas.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. She knew Tom well. He was always dedicated to his patients, no matter the cost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd stay up all night if it meant saving a life, and when there were cases he couldn't heal, he would spend his own savings to help cover the costs of treatments for others. He was just that kind of person&mdash;kind-hearted, thoughtful, and selfless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Alright, alright, you rest. We'll catch up later.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[When you get a chance, come over for dinner. My parents have been asking about you. They haven't seen you in two years and won't stop talking about you.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Sounds good! See you soon.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She added a playful emoji at the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Cash gift, 10 million dollars. Be good, Diana!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't help but laugh out loud. Every year, Tom insisted on giving her a gift of 10 million dollars, no questions asked. It was just how he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her heart warmed at the thought. This Christmas had truly been a great one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Alexander's voice broke through her thoughts. "Diana, I'm not sure I'm following this part. Could you explain it to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't quite familiar with the medical side of things, but Diana's proposal was so clear that even someone like him could easily grasp its meaning after just one look. For the more technical points, she had included helpful explanations in parentheses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the most thoughtful proposal he had ever read.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="971.html">« Prev</a><a href="973.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
