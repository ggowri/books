You beast. You hurt your own sister for a stripper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was stunned. "She knows. Harry, you can't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, since you want her to live, we will take good care of her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry deliberately spoke loudly, hung up the phone, and threw the phone out of the window into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked down at Diana who was sitting on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her face was full of anger, but she was so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, did you hear it? Your brother wants us to take good care of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was hatred in Diana's eyes. She knew that Gale was vicious, but she didn't expect him to be so vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He even hurt his own sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had already been disappointed with the Marsh family, and now she was only even more disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna calmly comforted Diana, "Miss Bishop, cheer up. It doesn't matter if you don't have that family. You have more people who love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was no longer sad. After experiencing so much suffering in her previous life, this time she only felt hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let's get started." Harry looked at Diana with ill intention and began to take off his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Diana was ruined, Steven would no longer want her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two men tried to pull Diana's clothes. She pretended to be terrified and screamed, "No... Let me go..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The men looked at the frightened Diana. Her frightened eyes were alluring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's coat was pulled off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other two attacked Luna, but Luna's hands had already been freed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked over with cold eyes filled with murderous intent. And the men paused slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Bitch, your eyes scare me. You should play a killer with that look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The men laughed wildly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna looked towards the door and thought, "Why hadn't Nolan and the police arrived yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that time, they started to work on Diana's pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna was very anxious. "Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana gave her a reassuring look. Nolan would come soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man was only concerned with taking off Diana's pants and did not notice Diana's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their hands were placed on Diana's waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The door was suddenly kicked open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Put your hands up. Don't move." More than two dozen special police officers with guns came in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Harry was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "Why are there so many police officers?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="116.html">« Prev</a><a href="118.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
