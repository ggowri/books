She hoped that Paula would lose everything and beg for mercy like a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She longed to outshine Diana and humiliate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven was mentioned, Amelie was very proud. "Mr. Gellar is fond of Queenie because she is excellent. How can Diana, a country bumpkin with no education and no job, be compared to her? Diana is not as good as her in the slightest."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula roared, "If you hadn't colluded with Jeff to replace my daughter with yours, Diana would have been better than Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was stunned. She was embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched this scene indifferently. Paula was now protective of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still remembered that when she happily followed Gale back home, Queenie burst into tears and said that she was sorry for taking away everything from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Queenie was so sad, Paula gazed at Diana coldly. "Diana, I know you are my biological daughter, but I raised Queenie and gave her all my love. You can stay in this family as an adopted daughter in the future. In this family, everything should be centered around Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Diana's expectations of family affection were instantly shattered. She later assumed that if she tried hard to be sensible, Paula would notice her advantages and definitely feel sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what did she get in the end? It was Paula's ruthless humiliation and a letter of severance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was lost in her own thoughts when Amelie mocked, "Paula, don't deceive yourself. You said Diana was your daughter. But we all know that she is just your adopted daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are unwilling to acknowledge your own biological daughter. How can you be Diana's mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's biggest regret was that she hurt Diana because of that bitch Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said painfully, "You are right. Family affection is the most precious bond in the world. No reason can be an excuse to deny this relationship. However, I made my own daughter an adopted daughter just for the sake of Queenie, who always cried, schemed against my own daughter, and played the victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, I had no idea of the truth and subconsciously protected Queenie, not wanting her to have any burdens or worries. I even refused to acknowledge my own daughter for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Queenie with hatred. "Queenie, but you are an ingrate."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was instantly panicked, and her face blushed. Paula's words would completely ruin her persona.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and took out a diagnosis certificate from her bag. "Everyone, I am very grateful for Ms. Barnes' careful education and her concern for me over the years, but what we just said is true. Paula is a mental patient. She had delusions before. I took her for an examination. This is the diagnosis certificate of mental illness."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that Paula would find out that she had taken the company away from her and come to her house to make trouble. In order to prevent future trouble, she asked someone to get a diagnosis certificate of mental illness. She had been planning to put Paula in a mental institution.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie held up the diagnosis certificate, stared at everyone, and said, "Everyone, please take a good look. What Ms. Barnes said now is all nonsense. Don't be fooled by her. Diana has framed and plotted against me many times, which resulted in a grudge between us. Have you read the trending topics? You are all smart. I believe you can make your own decisions about whose story is true."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was moving too fast to notice Steven lowering his head in the crowd.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="641.html">« Prev</a><a href="643.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
