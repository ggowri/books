"Mr. Gellar, I don't know where Mrs. Gellar is going. But they have booked a hotel here to play for three days. All the games in the mall are for the girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can watch movies, eat, have a spa, soak in hot springs, and play games on the fifth floor. Many girls come here to relax for a few days during their holidays. Mrs. Gellar and her friends may also want to relax themselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at him. "Let's stay in the presidential suite tonight. We will also stay here for the next three days. It will take another several days to complete the itinerary here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, no matter how far away it was, Steven would never stay in a hotel and would go home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now this place was close to his home, but he didn't go back. He indeed cared about Diana now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled and said, "Okay, Mr. Gellar. You have your private suite here. We can go have dinner now, and then go upstairs to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was very hungry. Steven had a bad mood today and had been in a meeting the whole time. Besides, he always glared at Evan, which made Evan nervous all day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan had a pancake for breakfast, and now he was really hungry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go have dinner." Steven's eyes were cold. Diana would rather stay with her friends for three days than go home and face him. Did she hate him so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled coldly and thought, "Diana, you can't escape from me. I will never let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tugged at his collar impatiently. His clothes opened wide, revealing his strong abdominal muscles, which were sexy and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan and a group of executives here followed behind Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan waved his hand and told them to go home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quite hard for them to deal with Steven's anger throughout the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the group of executives saw Evan waving his hand, they all breathed a sigh of relief and left quickly, fearing that they would be targeted by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the food area, Diana and her friends entered the restaurant. They sat down and were about to order when they saw Steven and Evan walk in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly shocked. Why was Steven here?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana's shocked expression, Steven smiled. She probably didn't expect to meet him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Gellar, what a coincidence. Are you having dinner here too?" Feeling the atmosphere was a bit awkward, Evan greeted them with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana came back to her senses and nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are playing here," Diana explained concisely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and stared at her with deep eyes. That was it? He was her husband. Didn't she care whether he had dinner or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't understand what Steven was thinking. She asked, "What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face became gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan stopped talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven wanted to have dinner with Diana. But since she didn't invite them, they couldn't just sit beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes became deeper, and he sat down beside Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him in confusion. She knew Steven didn't like barbecue. He had very good skin and didn't even get acne. He was very strict with his diet and didn't eat heavy-tasting food. That was the reason why he had good skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at Althea and Paige, Steven nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he looked at Diana and said, "You are having dinner with your friends. Why didn't you tell me? Since they are your friends, we should treat them."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="768.html">« Prev</a><a href="770.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
