His voice dropped to a low murmur. "I'll make it up to her tomorrow with the gift. I can't give it to her today. If Queenie finds out, everything we've planned will fall apart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All of this can still be fixed, including..." He trailed off, unable to finish the thought. Including the child Diana had mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how much of a monster he might be, he could never bring himself to kill Diana and their child. That's why he'd faked his own death&mdash;to give Diana the truth and spare her the agony. Every time she brought up the child, it sent her into an emotional tailspin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he almost had to believe in the idea of past lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil had acted strangely too. Especially that night&mdash;Cecil had dragged Diana into his arms and cried, holding her through the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that Diana knew the truth, even her smile seemed lighter, brighter. It was like she'd come back to life herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven would never know that there could be someone in this world who looked exactly like him and caused her so much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned to look at Evan, who was practically bouncing with excitement as he counted his check, his giddy grin making Steven feel embarrassed. The kid looked like he'd never seen money in his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really think I'd fake it on the bonuses?" Steven thought bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven watched Evan, who was practically bouncing with excitement. There was a part of him that envied the kid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was different from everyone else. He was easy to please, never greedy, always content with what he was owed. After all the years he'd spent by Steven's side, Evan had never been the type to take more than his fair share. A guy like him&mdash;good-hearted and clear-eyed&mdash;was rare in the cutthroat world of business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Evan, Steven felt like he could drop all his defenses. Whatever needed to be done, he trusted Evan to handle it. It was a rare feeling of calm, a relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Evan, after Christmas, I need you to go see Jace. Get him out of the hospital, change his identity, and let him handle Queenie and George himself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff and Amelie would soon have to face the consequences of their actions. Steven didn't even need to lift a finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace was more ruthless than his own sons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And then there's Zion," Steven thought. "Seems like he's no angel, either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan carefully slipped the check into his bag, then smiled, "Mr. Gellar, after the holidays, everyone's gonna be back in action. We should get out there, too. Spring's just around the corner..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan couldn't help but think of Luna, that soft, ethereal face of hers. It made him smile. With the ten million dollars he'd just gotten, he could finally propose. Luna had been waiting for him, and now he had everything he needed to make it official.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, I'm going to propose to Luna when I get back. She's been waiting for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven grinned. "Well, I'll congratulate you early then&mdash;hope the proposal goes well. And when you guys have your new house, I'll take care of it. Luna's a good girl&mdash;quiet, but kind. She risked her life to go out there and save you. That kind of loyalty deserves your true respect."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven paused for a moment, his smile fading into something a little more serious. "Evan, look at my mess of a love life. Learn from my mistakes. Once you're married, you and your wife need to treat each other with respect. There's gotta be understanding and compromise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan couldn't help but think, "I'm not going to be like Steven, that damn fool who hurt the person who loved him the most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Heh..." Evan chuckled softly. "Mr. Gellar, I'm not like you. I won't ever let Luna down. I'm not blind to what matters, like you were."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The words hit Steven like a sudden blow, a sharp pang in his chest. It was his fault&mdash;everything that had gone wrong, he had brought upon himself. He was the one who had made the mistakes, and now he had to live with the consequences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few years ago, Steven hadn't even known how to love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan noticed the sudden drop in Steven's mood. He could feel the tension thickening in the air. He quickly backpedaled. "Mr. Gellar, don't mind what I said. The hardest thing in life is admitting when you've been wrong. You've already realized where you messed up. When you see Mrs. Gellar next, you should apologize properly. The way you hurt her... it's not something you can just ignore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sighed, the weight of his own failure sinking in. "Who would believe that excuse?" he thought bitterly. Not Diana. Certainly not her. She wouldn't believe a word of it...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar," Evan continued, his tone softer now, "just take care of yourself. When you see Mrs. Gellar, you have to make it right. Apologize, show her you mean it. You can still fix things between you two... there's always a chance for a second shot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked down, his thoughts clouded with despair. "Maybe later," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana hadn't even forgiven Paula's family&mdash;there was no way she'd forgive him. But even if she never did, he just wanted her to be safe and happy. That was all that mattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He would never marry again. He would spend the rest of his life protecting her, even from afar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought of Diana's smile&mdash;the way her eyes lit up when she laughed, her bright teeth, the warmth that radiated from her. He couldn't bear the thought of her ever being sad, of her face ever wearing even the slightest trace of sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Christmas Day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's wallet was stuffed, filled with cash gifts from everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias transferred 10 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Julius transferred 10 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hubery transferred 30 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The note read: [Diana, making up for the past three years.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana saw that message, she grinned from ear to ear, laughing out loud. "Aww... Hubery is the best!" she squealed, almost in tears from joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was on cloud nine. A great start to the new year, a perfect Christmas!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my God...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Christmas cheer, Christmas cheer, bring in the wealth, bring in the wealth..." she sang as she hobbled down the stairs, her limp making the scene a little comical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stood at the bottom of the stairs and called out, "Luna, we're having a feast tonight! Call the 24/7 supermarket, the one that delivers all year round, and get them to send the freshest bluefin tuna. Oh, and have them bring a chicken for stew tonight, too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Make sure to get six lobsters, plus all kinds of shellfish&mdash;unlimited fish! We're going all out for breakfast. It's Christmas, the first light of dawn, and the air is filled with good omens. It's a sign of luck!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna smiled, clearly amused. "Got it. I'll have Nolan call them right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hehe..." Diana grinned as she went back to her room, ready to binge-watch more shows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Leopold transferred another 10 million dollars, followed by Helen and Edward&mdash;both sending large gifts as well. They were all in the tens of millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sat down on her bed, feeling overwhelmed with excitement. That's when she saw a new message from Jenny, Steven's mom. She froze, utterly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, Merry Christmas! Below is the Christmas gift I've set aside for you.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was stunned&mdash;Jenny had reached out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without thinking, Diana quickly dialed the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hi... Jenny. How are you?" Diana hesitated for a moment before speaking, not wanting to cause Jenny any worry, especially during the holidays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Jenny hadn't been close, but she knew Jenny was a kind and strong woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'm surprised you're still calling me. You must know the truth, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... that's why you're reaching out to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jenny's voice was steady but heavy with meaning. "Diana, there's so much more going on here&mdash;conspiracies that go back to your grandfather's generation. Steven... He's been under Queenie's spell for so long. But now, he's finally awake. This is all thanks to you. If you want to know more about the truth, meet me in ten days at the place I'll tell you. I'll explain everything, including why I left all those years ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's heart raced. She had always known there were reasons Jenny had left, reasons she couldn't understand at the time. She only remembered that Jenny had told her not to worry, that she would take care of everything. And then, for the next year, there had been no word, no contact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had been two years. Now, finally, Jenny had reached out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's voice shook as she asked, "Jenny... where exactly do I meet you?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="967.html">« Prev</a><a href="969.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
