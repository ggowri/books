If Diana refuses to admit it, I&#x27;ll take out the evidence, and Diana will be tortured to death by Cecil. They have a lot of punishments.&quot;</p><p>Diana looked at the indignant Queenie.</p><p>Then, Diana chuckled, &quot;Queenie, let me ask you. Do you have a conscience?&quot;</p><p>Queenie was stunned. She thought, &quot;Diana has really changed. If it were before, she would have hit me in a rage.&quot;</p><p>Now, Diana could respond calmly. It made Queenie feel a sense of crisis.</p><p>&quot;Diana, is it really that difficult to admit your mistakes? Mr. Farley is here. As long as you apologize and admit your mistakes, Mr. Farley will let you go.&quot;</p><p>Diana frowned and asked, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything wrong. Why should I admit my mistakes? Why should I apologize?&quot;</p><p>Queenie was stunned by Diana&#x27;s words, thinking, &quot;She&#x27;s still stubborn now.&quot;</p><p>Steven said angrily, &quot;Diana, there is evidence. There is video. I have checked it. Queenie did not wrongly accuse you. How long are you going to make trouble?&quot;</p><p>Diana looked at him with raised eyebrows. &quot;Who are you? What qualifications do you have to talk to me? Was it your grandma that I pushed? You are an outsider. Shut up.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at Cecil indifferently. &quot;Mr. Farley, I heard that you are going to hold a banquet for Queenie tomorrow night for her saving Madam Farley. In order to show my sincerity, how about I apologize in public tomorrow night?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was surprised, thinking, &quot;If she wants to apologize in public, I would make her more embarrassed.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil looked at Diana with a meaningful smile, thinking, &quot;Her face is amazing. But she&#x27;s too vicious.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He stood up, looked at Diana with a smile, and walked over.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, he slapped Diana in the face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven stepped forward with a frown. &quot;Cecil, enough. Diana is my wife.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s face suddenly became swollen. She looked at Steven and sneered. She still felt heartbroken when she saw him. &quot;Steven, stop it. I was beaten several times by you because of Queenie. You&#x27;re worse. Get out of here. I feel sick when I see you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven frowned deeply with a hint of disgust in his eyes. He thought, &quot;She&#x27;s really unrepentant.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil gathered his suit and said calmly, &quot;I slap you because you&#x27;re so disrespectful. Next time you dare to be arrogant in front of Queenie, I will tear your beautiful face.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He looked at Diana with evil eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was not annoyed and looked at him with a meaningful smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;He, as always, likes to protect his people.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Okay, Cecil. I remember this slap. Tomorrow night, I will return it tenfold. I will break your hands myself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana finished speaking and left the ward.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was stunned, thinking, &quot;Why is she so arrogant?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven quickly chased after Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Looking at Diana&#x27;s back, he felt irritable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as he was about to chase after her, he saw a gorgeous girl walking towards her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Honey.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana saw her good friend, Olivia Laurier, and was so surprised that she froze in place. &quot;Olivia.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The two quickly hugged each other and jumped up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, I miss you so much. We haven&#x27;t seen each other for three years.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia took a step back and saw Diana&#x27;s red and swollen face. She said seriously, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with your face? Who slapped you? I&#x27;ll avenge you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana quickly stopped her. &quot;Don&#x27;t be impulsive. I just encountered three dogs and got bit by one. Do you want to bite back after being bitten by a dog? How disgusting!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was stunned.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="16.html">« Prev</a><a href="18.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
