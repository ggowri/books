He didn&rsquo;t even have a chance to help her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander handed her a glass of water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had talked a lot in the meeting room earlier. If it weren&rsquo;t for Dalton, she would&rsquo;ve been truly exhausted. She drank half of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours of meetings finally over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">H</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ate spending the whole day stuck at the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hated days like this, which was why she had handed the company over to Nolan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Diana was working even harder than Nolan every single day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sat down, "Diana, talk about the medical assistance system. I want these products on the market in six months. I can handle this without involving Mr. Turner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked a bit surprised. "Alexander, these products were supposed to launch next month. But now we have a better option, so we decided on three months. Why delay it to six?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said, "Diana, this is a letter Sir Bishop asked me to bring to you. Open it and take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was puzzled, unsure why Leopold had given Alexander a letter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold must really trust Alexander!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pulled out a piece of white stationery from the envelope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The letter read: [Diana, I know the medical assistance system is your passion, but you're drawing too much attention right now. Wait a little longer, launch these products in six months. Trust me.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Alexander and asked, "Alexander, when you saw my grandfather, did he say anything else to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander replied, "He said something might happen soon, and since you're the CEO, a lot of people are watching you. He suggested launching the new products in six months."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you're doing great in the fashion industry. Sir Bishop meant he hopes you'll focus on that first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go with you to talk to Mr. Turner about this. The other shareholders will benefit a lot from the fashion industry, they won't oppose delaying the system launch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, your designs already caused a sensation. If the medical system launches now, the Gellar Group might come under attack. I know you care about the patients, but we need to think about </span><span>more</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana realized that Leopold must have sensed danger</span><span>. </span><span>"Alexander, I understand what you mean now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled as he opened the cake he brought, speaking softly, "Diana, try this cake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the chocolate cake he handed over and smiled brightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you." Diana took a bite of the cake. It was delicious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe it was the sweetness of the cake, but her mood lifted instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This, however, put Steven in a foul mood. Diana rarely smiled that brightly in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan stood nearby, watching the video on Steven's phone. Diana and Alexander looked perfect together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the anger and jealousy on Steven's face, Evan felt no sympathy for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had no right to be angry. He let Diana go first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven muttered, "I pushed Diana away. Do I even have the right to be angry? Or jealous?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, you're absolutely right. This sudden affection? I don't get it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven snapped, "Evan, how dare you talk to me like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, he simply didn&rsquo;t know how to love Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He </span><span>was</span><span> accustomed to loneliness, locking away his kind heart and keeping everyone at a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To others, Steven was arrogant, dismissive, and ruthlessly cold-hearted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was numb. For any feeling, except for his grandma and grandpa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other than completing the tasks Edward assigned and keeping himself alive, Steven felt everything else was utterly meaningless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t until Steven&rsquo;s car accident, when he lost his sight and heard Diana&rsquo;s joyful voice, that he finally felt alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He handed her over a dozen divorce papers because Queenie was back, and Diana's life was in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Steven who made Diana leave. But when she truly left his world, he regretted it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan boldly said, "Mr. Gellar, if you still love Mrs. Gellar, take out Queenie and George already. Let&rsquo;s get back. Otherwise, Luna&rsquo;s gonna be gone too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was desperate, determined to keep Luna from leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at his anxious expression and joked, "Relax, Luna&rsquo;s waiting for you. Aren&rsquo;t you secretly texting her every day and even sneaking around asking about her lingerie size?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan stared at Steven in shock, completely caught off guard that Steven had noticed his actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, that&rsquo;s too much. How could you secretly keep tabs on my life?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sighed, "It&rsquo;s just </span><span>we</span><span> living here. Sometimes you get so excited, I can see your phone screen without even trying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked, "Does buying lingerie for a woman have some special meaning?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan shook his head, "I never thought </span><span>that</span><span>. </span><span>J</span><span>ust want to buy all kinds of clothes for </span><span>my</span><span> </span><span>girl.</span><span> I love her.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven froze in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was surprised too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven, with all his schemes and arrogance on the surface, was actually caught off guard by those words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked again, "Is this what truly loving someone looks like?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to buy Diana beautiful clothes too, wanted to give her all the best things in the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan nodded, then shook his head. "Mr. Gellar, honestly, I don&rsquo;t really know what love is either. But I </span><span>know,</span><span> I love Luna</span><span>.</span><span> I&rsquo;ll make her the happiest woman. After working for you all these years, I have the money and the means to do it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat on the couch, watching Diana happily finish her second slice of cake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It hit him then&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t really know how to love her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1048.html">« Prev</a><a href="1050.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
