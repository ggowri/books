I didn't have an appointment and called you, but she asked the bodyguards to throw me out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The receptionist became more and more arrogant. "Madam, there is only one lady who can enter and leave our company freely, and that is Mr. Gellar's beloved, Ms. Marsh. Didn't you barge in to cause trouble? What did I do wrong?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, how dare you make a scene here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are apparently a slut. You must want to seduce Mr. Gellar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Diana had expected, the receptionist was instructed by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hung up the phone, ignoring Steven's reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stepped forward and kicked the receptionist in the stomach. Caught off guard, she flew out and collapsed to the floor in embarrassment.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered and growled word by word, "I won't put up with you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, what are you doing? Why did you attack her?" Queenie walked over with a lunchbox and glared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was great. Diana came just in time to cause trouble for Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had already warned Diana to get out of Capitole, or she would have many ways of dealing with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Marsh, save me. She lost her mind and hit me." The receptionist trembled all over. That kick almost took her life. Her mind went blank when she fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, believe it or not, I will call the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana raised her eyebrows slightly. Dressed in black, she exuded an aura of indifference. She chuckled, "Go ahead. I have some evidence that you have set me up. I'll hand it over to the police at the same time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie mocked, "Diana, you always say such things, but why haven't you handed over the evidence to the police?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stared at her with a calm expression. Her beautiful eyes were icy in the light. "Because it's not time yet. When the time comes, you will meet your doom and become the ugliest corpse in the world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, she cared for no one but her grandfather and her three brothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, do you know how painful it is to die and to have your soul separated from your body? One day, I will put you through such a hellish experience."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's serious tone and her cold gaze scared Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish her sentence, Steven stepped out of the elevator, followed by Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven." Queenie approached him excitedly. "Diana beat a receptionist in your company. How reckless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He cast a sharp glance at Diana and asked, "Diana, why did you beat her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled calmly, "Why? Well, you should know how she did her job. Her insults were quite annoying. I am too ill-tempered to bear such talk. What's wrong with me kicking her? Just call the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven noticed her coldness and knew how furious she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, I didn't insult her. She framed me." The receptionist walked weakly up to Steven and acted pitifully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna sneered, raised her phone, and played a video for him. "Mr. Gellar, see for yourself!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="214.html">« Prev</a><a href="216.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
