Steven couldn't find any information unless their identities were very secretive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sorry, I misunderstood just now." Steven apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold sneered. "You misunderstood that my granddaughter is a fickle person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven pursed his lips. The scene just now was very easy to be misunderstood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't talk because he wasn't very sociable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Apart from work matters, he didn't handle personal issues very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hmph! Steven, hurry up and get a divorce. My granddaughter is going to marry Alexander. Don't delay my granddaughter's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Go and marry Queenie." Leopold said directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, go home." Leopold's face was full of love when he faced his granddaughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The speed of changing faces was very fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at this scene and felt a little envious. Leopold treated Diana very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was polite, calm and steady. He always restrained his emotions and never used intimate terms in front of women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold called Diana intimately all the time, which showed that Diana was very favored at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana suddenly asked, "Grandpa, who did you come with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh my! I almost forgot about him. Diana, wait a minute. I'll let you meet Alexander's grandfather. He is very interesting. He and I are very compatible... We have similar tastes. I'll go and ask him to come down. He will definitely like you as his grandson's wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grandpa, stop making a fuss. If you want him to accept me, you should say it later. I haven't even divorced yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't want to be accused of cheating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander was a good person, but Diana thought that he was not good enough for her to marry him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Leopold heard this, he thought it made sense. "Then you two can get to know each other, and then introduce each other formally after you get divorced."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold ran away happily, without even a glance at Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana breathed a sigh of relief. She watched her grandfather leave, and then she turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana called Leopold while walking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grandpa, I have something else to do. I'm leaving first. We'll talk about meeting Alexander's grandfather next time. This is rude. I should bring a gift when we meet for the first time. I didn't bring any gifts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What are you worrying about? Why would you bring gifts to your own family? But you are right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"He is important. It is polite to bring some gifts before going over. You go back first, and I will have fun for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana breathed a sigh of relief. She thought, "Fortunately, grandpa did not force it any further."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hung up the phone and sent a message to the bodyguard, asking them to protect Leopold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She breathed a sigh of relief after she went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, she called Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, ten models will go to the company tomorrow morning. You can send them the contract and let them have a look. If they are satisfied, let them stay in the company. The ten of them will go to the winter fashion show."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna replied. "Okay, Miss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With ten male models, Diana still needed ten female models.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed she had to look for them, which was really difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next few days were going to be busy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was waiting for a bus on the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven suddenly said, "Diana, come back with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "Where are we going? To see you and Queenie being affectionate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven said in a cold voice, "I take care of her because she saved me and we have a bond since childhood. I have no feelings for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed and said, "Steven, do you have a conscience? Just think about why you have no feelings for her? At her birthday party, you clearly saw the truth, but you still hugged her and left even though she pretended to faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You ignored me. When I was humiliated by so many people, you, as my husband, stood aside and let others humiliate me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, if you made a mistake, it's a mistake. If you make a mistake, just admit it. Continuing to explain will only make you look more embarrassed and hypocritical."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Scenes from the past came to Diana's mind, and Steven felt that he had gone too far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven realized that Queenie was very good at pretending to be a victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly said, "Diana, the man in the photo Queenie sent you is not me, do you believe it?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="162.html">« Prev</a><a href="164.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
