All she wants is a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that happens, Jeff's scandals will come to light, and he'll end up with nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Queenie, Paula can't touch her; she's got Andrew backing her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula knows that, too, but she won't let Jeff and his daughter have an easy time of it. I'm just here for the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thanking the servant who had sent the video, Diana set her phone aside and returned to her work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Althea wasn't feeling too great. After a brief nap, she woke up with a sore back and decided to take a stroll around her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of going into labor filled her with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the snow had stopped, but fog blanketed the sea, obscuring any sense of direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fishing boats bobbed alone in the mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Althea listened to music, she paced back and forth in her room, taking breaks to sit down whenever she felt tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the afternoon, a dull ache settled in her lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having read plenty of experiences shared by expectant mothers and doctors, she reassured herself that she still had some time before giving birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling manageable discomfort, Althea decided to seek out Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Diana was a doctor, and the thought of having Diana nearby made her happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knocking on Diana's door, she waited impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly swung the door open, concern etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea, are you feeling uncomfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea nodded, her voice shaky. "Diana, you were right. I'm starting to feel the effects, and my belly is beginning to hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana immediately performed a quick check and said, "You're definitely in labor, Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic! Let's head to the hospital right now. We need to get you admitted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I reserved a VIP room, and I've already brought everything I need for the delivery. Let's go!" Althea replied, excitement bubbling in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana helped her put on a hat and mask, and together, they made their way downstairs to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across the street, Penelope sat by her window, scrolling through her phone while waiting for Althea to come down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had expected Althea to take a few more days, so she was surprised to see Althea emerge that afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Diana guide Althea into the hospital, Penelope's eyes gleamed with calculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! My aunt works at that hospital. If I can get my hands on Althea's baby, I can squeeze some cash out of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea's hiding here to keep Gale from finding out about the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, she messaged her aunt before heading downstairs for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Althea checked into her hospital room, waiting for her contractions to progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor confirmed that she was well-suited for a natural delivery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around seven, Diana brought a simple dinner for them to share.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea could manage the pain at that time, but beads of sweat began to form on her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that giving birth wasn't about screaming; it was about enduring the pain quietly. Yelling would only sap her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea, here, take this medication," Diana said, glancing at the clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed Althea a pill to help ease her discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trusting her completely, Althea swallowed the medication and resumed her pacing in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of pain hit her, and she fought back tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it hurts so much," Althea said, wiping sweat from her brow, though she managed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a pang of sympathy. "Althea, hang in there. It's going to be tough, but once the baby is here, the pain will fade. You've got this; your little one will be adorable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana encouraged her with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Althea replied, gritting her teeth but still managing to smile through the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the door, Penelope stood quietly, phone in hand, secretly recording the whole scene.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="560.html">« Prev</a><a href="562.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
