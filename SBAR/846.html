At the sight of the drawings on her phone, Queenie was angry and shocked but more eager to own them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she was very confident that she would win the championship today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was overjoyed that the drawings were given to her by Diana herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion sent Queenie a message, promising that he would be able to clear her name as long as she could win the championship and that her movie could be released normally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Endless resources and a bright future awaited her. Diana would always be a stepping stone for her. Queenie, who had stolen the design drawings, was in a very good mood at that moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the piano competition, it was postponed due to various things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't even look at Steven. She was well aware that Queenie would definitely get first place this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collection was unique. With his marketing planning skills, Steven was sure to make a lot of money. Their company focused on high-end couture and dresses worth millions of dollars were a common occurrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't set out to win or to compete with Queenie, who had always loved the limelight.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven wondered when Queenie had touched his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had met her in the past half month, but he did not give her the chance to get close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth did she get the design drawings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at the judges not far away, who were very satisfied with Queenie's design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizens were also discussing QM Company's clothes online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven realized that Queenie could win first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the models from Diana's company appeared, he was stunned. This was obviously not at her level. The design was very average. Why did she...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared at her in bewilderment, but she was scrolling through her phone with her head down, ignoring him. Her big, beautiful eyes were full of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that she was furious and thought that he had plotted against her again, but it really had nothing to do with him this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't take the blame for this incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The competition ended at half past one in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Queenie was the champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana came in second!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A designer from Steven's company won third place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They should go on stage to receive their awards, but Diana refused and went directly to find Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked Nolan to take her place on the stage. As the president of the company, he could represent her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she left, Steven followed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went backstage and looked for Paige but couldn't find her after searching around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw Luna sitting inside and resting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, where's Paige?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied, "Diana, she played games at the door just now. Then, she received a phone call and went out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana found it very strange. "What happened? She didn't answer my call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna shook her head. "After telling me that she was going out to answer a phone call, she left directly. I thought she went to look for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had a premonition and picked up her phone to call Paige again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her three attempts, she still couldn't get through to Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was worried. "Luna, look for Paige. She didn't answer my calls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna pondered and said, "Diana, maybe she didn't hear her phone ring because the venue was packed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Maybe. But we should still look for her. I'll go to the venue, and you can search backstage for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They acted separately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ran into Steven at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He blocked her way. "Diana, wait a moment. Give me a moment to explain."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="845.html">« Prev</a><a href="847.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
