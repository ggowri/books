Then, he said in a casual voice, "They're really ambitious. Tell me what you found out."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan said, "Jace also arranged for someone to participate in tonight's conspiracy. I found a short video clip. When Luna was taken away, I saw a familiar face. The steward of the Foliot family was nearby."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven calmly said, "Well! Send someone to keep an eye on them. You can go back and rest."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan looked at his expressionless face and asked, "Mr. Gellar, aren't you going home?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven closed his eyes tiredly and shook his head, his voice hoarse. "I'll sleep in the company."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan didn't try to persuade Steven anymore. Evan was going to sleep in the company tonight as well. It would be troublesome to run back and forth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then ordered a midnight snack for Steven. He placed them on Steven's desk and advised, "Mr. Gellar, you should eat a little. You can't be hard on your body."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven nodded calmly. "Okay!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Evan left, Steven picked up his phone and opened Diana's Instagram. She hadn't posted much recently, except for the photo she posted at the beach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "This woman really doesn't have me in her heart anymore.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, she would send me messages every day to ask me to come home for dinner. But after leaving the banquet and clearing up the divorce, she never took the initiative to contact me anymore."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said she didn't love Steven anymore. But Steven felt very upset.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven opened the box on the desk and started eating.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "My father's illegitimate son is rampant and even sent a message to provoke me today.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I can't fall. I need to eat well."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes were ruthless and sharp. His every move carried the oppressive feeling of a superior.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a day's rest, Diana went to work.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nothing that had happened at the banquet was posted on the Internet. The Internet was quiet, and even her name could not be searched.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was a little surprised. She thought, "Who cleaned the Internet so cleanly?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She searched for her name in the search box again. There was really no negative news about her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt strange and called Nolan.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Diana."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked him, "Nolan, there is negative news about me on the Internet. Did you deal with it?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan said, "No, Diana. Didn't you say don't worry about it?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was curious about who helped her deal with it so cleanly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, Joseph sat in the hospital chair.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes were focused, and his fingers were tapping quickly. He cleared all the negative news about Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph had just found out that her name was Diana, and there was a lot of negative news about her. She was his benefactor, and he would not let these people slander her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to find any more negative news about Diana, he smiled with satisfaction.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph picked up his phone and looked at Diana's dialog box, still left with yesterday's conversation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought about it and sent her a message.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, my grandmother had a full body checkup today. Dr. Cullen said she could be scheduled for surgery. Thank you, Diana!]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he nervously waited for messages from Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was just about to ask Luna when she suddenly saw the message from Joseph.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="347.html">« Prev</a><a href="349.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
