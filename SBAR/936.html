He was sure Queenie would get what was coming to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his dad's help, Cecil turned the company around in just a few months, making it super profitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil then faced Samuel. "You've done a lot of bad stuff, Samuel. I don't trust you. If you want my help, prove you're sorry. One year. Show me you're decent, and maybe I'll help. But right now, you've crossed Queenie, and you know she'll make your life hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, </span><span>Samuel was stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he muttered, "Cecil... Why do you all make her sound so terrifying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil let out a cold, sharp laugh. "Terrifying? Of course, she is. Only when you've truly experienced that fear will you understand. Queenie isn't </span><span>a </span><span>human</span><span>, but</span><span> a demon straight out of hell</span><span>!</span><span> The things she orders you to do? You'll never find evidence against her. That's her brilliance&mdash;she keeps her hands spotless. But you? You won't get off that easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Queenie's got guts, and she's cunning. The evidence I have on her right now isn't enough to take her down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil also knew the man Diana had mentioned had shown up. What caught him off guard was that she had decided to tell him about it. What blew his mind, though, was that the man looked exactly like Steven. That was why Cecil planned to meet Diana first thing in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Cecil," Samuel finally said, his tone solemn. "I'll stick by your side, do things the right way. You say jump, and I'll ask how high. This year, I'm all in&mdash;whatever you and Grandma decide, I'll roll with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil raised an eyebrow, surprised. "You want to stick with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita, seated nearby, </span><span>frowned </span><span>slightly, clearly disapproving of the idea. Samuel had always been a troublemaker, and she worried he might just be playing a game of false loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how eager Samuel was, Cecil relented. "Fine. I'll give you one chance to redeem yourself. But you'll have to handle your dad on your own. If he keeps going against our company, he's only digging his own grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Cecil lounged back into the sofa and stretched his legs out leisurely, exuding an air of effortless confidence and defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel couldn't help but notice the change in him&mdash;Cecil had grown calmer, more composed, almost to the point of being unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, despite the weight of everything, Samuel's face lit up with excitement. Cecil had </span><span>agreed to take him under his wing. He knew that if he could learn from both Cecil and Rita, he might just turn his life around for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel looked at Rita with sincerity and promised, "Grandma, I was foolish before and let you down despite all your kindness. But this time, I truly understand. Please, Grandma, give me one more chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita took a deep breath and pressed her lips</span><span> </span><span>as she looked at him. "Alright, alright. Seeing how genuine you're being, I'll forgive you this time. But I hope you don't turn out as despicable as your father</span><span> -</span><span> that heartless bastard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm willing to forgive you because you're young," she said sincerely. "If you change, work hard, and take things seriously, you'll be on the right track. I'm not asking for perfection, but aim to be honest, kind, and caring. Being good doesn't always mean you'll get rewards, but true blessings come to those with a good heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's eyes glistened with unshed tears as he nodded. "Grandma, I understand now." But in his heart, he knew the realization had come too late; he had nearly caused irreparable harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita couldn't stand to look at his pitiful expression any longer. So, she said, "</span><span>Glad to hear that</span><span>. Now go get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. Thank you, Grandma. And thank you, Cecil." Samuel stood up, his face breaking into a bright smile as he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Rita was a little surprised he'd come back to ask for forgiveness. Given what a scumbag his father was, she had long been disappointed in their whole family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Cecil and said, "You still need to keep an eye on Samuel. He's done so many wrong things. His finally learning to behave today honestly caught me off guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's smile was sly and enigmatic as he replied, "Grandma, he's realized now that he was being used. </span><span>His eyes are sincere</span><span>. He truly wants to change. Let's give him this chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita nodded slightly. "Fine. But if you notice anything off about him, get him out of your life immediately. You're both my grandsons, but I only want one with a kind heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil understood exactly what she meant&mdash;if it weren't for Diana, he'd probably be six feet under by now. He said, "Grandma, I'm going to see Diana. There are things I need to clear up with her before we can make any plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita gestured toward the kitchen. "I prepared some desserts for Diana. Take them to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Grandma. That's perfec</span><span>t. </span><span>Diana loves desserts." Cecil stood up, slipped on his puffer jacket, grabbed the gift from the kitchen, and headed out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Cecil drove the car out of the gates, he saw Samuel being apprehended by the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Cecil quickly steered toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the officers holding Samuel, he asked, "Samuel, what's going on? What did you do this time? Why are you being arrested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel let out a frustrated sigh, anger flashing in his eyes. "Someone reported me for murder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil froze, utterly stunned. Turning to the police officer, he asked, "Officer, can I ask who he supposedly killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer replied, "It's Diana. We received a report claiming Samuel killed Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil blinked in disbelief, his mind racing as he wondered. "Queenie, someone as meticulous as her, made such a blunder? Does she believe Samuel killed Diana or does she trust him so much she's just playing along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back at Samuel, Cecil said, "Go with them for now. I'll go find Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel wasn't too worried about this anymore, especially since Diana was fine and he'd be out in 24 hours. But the family business? That was a different story. He quickly said, "Cecil, I'm worried they're going after the company. Help my dad out&mdash;don't let Queenie get her way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's expression grew serious as he realized he'd completely overlooked this issue. "Got it. I'll talk to your dad. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel managed a faint smile, fully aware that his apology to Cecil the previous night was the reason Cecil was willing to help him today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until after this whole ordeal that Samuel truly understood&mdash;when things go south, the only people who can help you are your siblings. And even then, only one or two of them will genuinely have your back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking the moment of seriousness, Samuel asked in confusion, "Cecil, you know exactly what Queenie's been up to. Why haven't you exposed her? If you did, she wouldn't have a leg to stand on."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="935.html">« Prev</a><a href="937.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
