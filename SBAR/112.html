The earrings are now on the market. I have already bought them. They will be delivered in two days. You deserve the best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you, Tobias!" Diana was very happy. Her voice was sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wanted to cry. How had she lost all those people who loved her so much in her previous life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was because of her stupid love that she lost the person who loved her the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, they died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tobias, thank you!" Diana said in a low voice with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias asked, "What's wrong? Did Queenie bully you again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana quickly shook her head. "No, I'm just too happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You scared me. Go to the restaurant. I'll be there soon." Tobias trotted back to the room to take a shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and thought Tobias was cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at the moving scene and felt uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He walked to the door and asked, "Diana, what is your relationship with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana just then remembered that there was another person, Steven, in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at him unhappily. "What does this have to do with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven said, "Diana, you are still my wife. You are having an affair with other men..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said, "Steven, shut up. You have no right to say anything about me, let alone Tobias. You are the scum here. You are the one who refuses to divorce me and has an affair with Queenie! What qualifications do you have to question me? Please, if it's not about divorce, don't come to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was annoyed. In this situation, she just wanted Steven to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She left quickly and went to the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at her back and then followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They arrived at the restaurant. The chef saw Diana coming and greeted her with a smile, "Miss Bishop, good morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and nodded. "I'm hungry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay! Mr. Tobias Bishop has already made arrangements. It will be ready soon. Please take a seat first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana found a seat by the window and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, Steven sat opposite her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was confused. "Steven, why are you still haunting me? You are so shameless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sneered, "Diana, you're getting mean. You act so obedient in front of me, and you're so free in front of other men."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was helpless and said, "You seem to have forgotten what you said on the night we got married. What you need is a well-behaved wife, who will not bring shame to your family. Therefore, I have stopped all my hobbies and become a well-behaved wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now I know I was so stupid to listen to you. Loving you made me lost myself. Because of your words, I have become someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've become unhappy. I admit that I've been obsessed with you for the past two years. The reason I've been pestering you is that Queenie often posts photos of the two of you together. The photos of you kissing irritated me. That's why I occasionally lose my temper with you, so that you can pay more attention to me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But you said that I was ignorant and had to argue with Queenie about everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Have any of you ever thought about me? I am innocent. Why should this relationship be built on my pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If it weren't for the show that Queenie acted that day, and you slapped me to wake me up, I would still be stuck in this relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, I really won't love you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said everything. She didn't ask Steven to believe her but only asked him to divorce her quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's hands on his knees were clenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, who told you that I kissed Queenie?" Steven had never kissed any other woman in his life.He felt wronged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was helpless. "Steven, why are you pretending to be innocent? Don't you dare to take responsibility for what you have done?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana showed the texts between her and Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was not afraid to show them to Steven. She had backups anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anyway, she came back to this life just to tear off Queenie's disguise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said, "Look at the evidence. You two are disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I want to keep the evidence for divorce. They include the evidence of you two in bed. "</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven picked up the phone with doubt.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="111.html">« Prev</a><a href="113.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
