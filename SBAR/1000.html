The weather is nice today. Let's go have Chili."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe smiled happily, "Mario, I'll be out in ten minutes. Please wait for me a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario's tone was gentle. "Alright, no problem. I'm free today, I'll be waiting for you in the underground parking lot. Chloe, hurry up! I found a place with your favorite flavors. I want to eat with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe glanced at the people in the lab, blushing shyly, and replied softly, "Okay, Mario, I'll be there soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom, looking at Chloe's flushed face, teased her with a smile, "Chloe, is your boyfriend calling you for lunch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe shook her head and smiled, "No, Professor Cullen. He's not my boyfriend, just someone I admire a lot. He's the school heartthrob, and we met before Christmas. He's been inviting me out for meals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom smiled, thinking of Diana's instructions. He added, "Seems like he's interested in you. But Chloe, the project we're working on is crucial, and I'd like you to keep it private for now. After we finish the experiment, then you can tell him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe smiled, "Professor Cullen, don't worry. We've signed a confidentiality agreement. I won't tell anyone about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom was a kind-hearted man, and since Chloe made her promise, he was relieved and allowed her to continue with her work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, Tom called everyone for lunch, and Chloe was the first to rush out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom watched Chloe's back and shook his head slightly, thinking to himself, "Young girls in love really are in a rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's this? Oh right, it's called being in the throes of love. They always can't wait to get to their lover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, shook his head, and called Joseph to join them for lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the underground parking lot, Chloe shouted happily, "Mario!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario quickly got out of the car and elegantly opened the door for Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, get in. It's cold outside." Mario's every move was gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Chloe's eyes, Mario, driving a luxury car and being the executive CEO of several branch companies, was undoubtedly a successful business elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled as she sat in the passenger seat, feeling a little flustered and shy. She sat up properly, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario smiled. After sitting in the driver's seat, he took a bouquet of roses from the backseat and placed it in Chloe's lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, I heard you like roses, so I brought these for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's face turned red as she shyly accepted the roses, looking down to see how fresh they were. The roses were releasing a faint and pleasant fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario watched her with affection, his expression soft and tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, sit properly. We're about to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Chloe replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana arrived at the Gellar Group office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately saw Cecil standing at the door. His figure was tightly wrapped in a black trench coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collar was casually turned up, partially obscuring his jaw, making him seem even more mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His deep gaze gave off a rebellious aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana, he smiled brightly, "Diana, Queenie's project has already started. The workers have been arranged to be on site today. I came specifically to tell you this good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes slightly. She had been waiting for this day for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had invested a lot of money in the project, and George had also invested heavily. It was his path to development after returning to the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, before the work began tomorrow, his dream would be shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Cecil and spoke in a calm tone, "Cecil, you can go ahead and find those experts now. That land has ancient noble tombs, with a huge underground palace. It's a cultural heritage site, and it can't be developed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil chuckled. He had sold the land at a good price back in the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, with Diana's reminder, he hadn't lost any money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'll report it immediately. Before they start construction tomorrow, I'll be there to watch the drama unfold," he said, a wicked smile forming on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil appeared indifferent, yet inwardly, he was stubborn and unscrupulous in his methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also waiting for this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was skilled at scheming, and he didn't just sit back and do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was skilled in strategic planning, but he was good at waiting for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at his wicked smile but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil turned to Olivia, his smile widening. "Olivia, do you have time tonight? Want to join me for dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was a bit surprised and, being blunt, asked, "Just the two of us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil rubbed his nose and smiled, "No. Diana, we can go together. Something good will happen tomorrow, and I want to celebrate tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia smiled but felt a bit unexpectedly disappointed. She wasn't sure what she was disappointed about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. If Diana has time, that's all that matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia looked at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana winked at her, and for some reason, Olivia's face seemed a little flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I have plans tonight. I'm meeting Alexander. You two can go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She truly had something important to do tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's smile grew a bit awkward. He had really been craving spicy Chili tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, let's go just the two of us. I know a great spicy Chili. You like spicy food, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia did indeed love spicy Chili.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She agreed without hesitation. When she was not working, she enjoyed life to the fullest. She cheerfully replied, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil checked the time and said with a smile, "Olivia, I'll pick you up in the afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil had grown a lot over the past year, more assertive and steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia nodded with a smile. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil left happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia pushed Diana into the office and then asked, "Diana, are you really interested in Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled faintly, "Olivia, I've died once. If I meet someone I like, I'll fall for him. I'd want to fall in love. The key is that I'm single now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia, sitting across from her, suddenly showed a smile that Diana couldn't quite understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana found her smile puzzling and said, "Olivia, your smile is giving me the chills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's fortune had been changing, and she didn't know how to tell her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You silly girl, you shouldn't say things like that about your best friend. But you should think carefully before starting a relationship. Don't get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana understood that it was a kind reminder. She wasn't necessarily looking for love, but she thought Alexander had a good character. Most importantly, she wanted to rely on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the lights began to glow, Diana and Alexander sat across from each other by the window at a seaside restaurant, chatting happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, disguised Evan and Steven also arrived at the same restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana, Evan glanced at Steven beside him and immediately understood why Steven insisted on having dinner there.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="999.html">« Prev</a><a href="1001.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
