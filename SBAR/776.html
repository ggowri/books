"Steven, do you want to come see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's lips, sensual yet cold, curled into a sardonic smile. "Queenie, did you just accuse me of hiring someone to violate Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned. "Steven, what do you mean by this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock rippled through her quivering voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know exactly what I mean. I fell for your lies before, but I didn't anticipate you'd keep slandering me to Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't, Steven. I know you don't care for her. It's just that Diana shamelessly clings to you, and I said those things to make her leave you on her own. Didn't you say you wanted to marry me? You can't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven ended the call mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive wave of his hand, he instructed the bodyguards to remove the two men from the premises.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lounge emptied, leaving only Diana and him in the now quiet space.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fell on her face as he noted the slight improvement in her complexion. "Did you hear that, Diana? That's how she slanders me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face paled. "But the things you and she did to me are real experiences."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if tonight's events weren't orchestrated by Steven, there was no denying that the prior incidents were unmistakably linked to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her solitary figure, aware that she wouldn't believe him anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't in a rush; kindness was never his forte.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Queenie wanted to play games? I'll play along slowly."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed Diana, entering the room just as she did, locking the door behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned and looked at him. Her disdain for him was written plainly on her face. Did he not see it?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't wish to see him now, nor did she want to endure more trouble. She was exhausted from a day of turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven grinned. "Diana, we're a couple. What do you think I want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer found satisfaction in secretly holding her in his arms every night; he yearned to have sex with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Steven grabbed her hand, his other hand cradling the back of her head, pressing her into a forceful kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned, her wide eyes accusing him of shamelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he kiss her after what had just transpired?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fought against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her resistance only fueled his desire to conquer her. She carried a scent that was intoxicatingly familiar, reminiscent of the unique shampoo he once favored but had to discontinue after she left. Evan had searched for it, hoping to recapture that essence, but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on Steven then that his world had long since merged with Diana's.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Diana couldn't live without him; it was he who couldn't survive without Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization made his actions more assertive. With a gentle push, Diana's slender frame was pinned against the wall, immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rarely had Diana been this close to him. His masculine presence enveloped her, leaving no room for escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze lowered, taking in her flushed and furious face, but his lips betrayed a smile. His fingers traced her cheek tenderly, with a hint of affection in his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze. Her struggles ceased, and a blush colored her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An air of intimacy settled between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next instant, Diana felt a wave of dizziness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her senses returned, Steven had already laid her on the bed, his body over hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breaths were heavy when he stopped kissing her. His eyes burned into hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, within the depths of his eyes, Diana glimpsed a swirling storm of emotion that belied his calm exterior.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="775.html">« Prev</a><a href="777.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
