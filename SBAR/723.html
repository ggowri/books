She was still stuffed and couldn't eat another bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, dinner was still hours away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She caught Tom's gentle yet hopeful gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, she said, "Tom, I just finished lunch, and dinner's not for ages. I need to head home and work on my design sketches.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I'm thinking of building a lab in the basement for the intelligent development of the treatment system. Could you help plan that out?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once things settle down with my company, I'll join you in the research and development."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom watched her throw herself into her work with such passion and finally felt at ease. He teased, "Diana, you're absolutely glowing now that you're not letting romance cloud your judgment."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This is the Diana I know, her eyes sparkling with passion when she's not consumed by romance."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana huffed and playfully punched his chest in mock anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tom, you've never been in love, you don't know how wonderful it is. Isn't that how love is? It's either a forever kind of thing or it leaves you heartbroken and shattered. Even though I ended up with the latter, I don't regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She honestly didn't regret what she had willingly given her heart to.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she did regret was not seeing the situation clearly and not understanding their true hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't too late to see things clearly now. She was genuinely happy with her life these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The joy of her rebirth and newfound freedom shone like a beacon, lighting her path forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom couldn't believe she had no regrets, but as long as she was safe and sound, that was all that mattered. "You know, it's a good thing you didn't completely neglect your studies when you were head over heels in love. You managed to finish your master's degree under the professor's guidance. You were the youngest graduate student she ever had, her pride and joy."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled confidently, tilting her head and tapping her temple. "Tom, even though I was all about love back then, I knew that real strength came from within. I never gave up on learning."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom affectionately patted her head. "Yeah, yeah, look at you being all proud. I've got surgery in twenty minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay then, I won't keep you any longer, Tom."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!" Tom's expression soured slightly. "You still owe me lunch. Better make it up soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, yes, yes! I'll make up for all those missed lunches when I get the chance, haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter was full of joy as if it could brighten the whole world.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her happy, Tom felt relieved. Her laughter was like a clear spring, soothing the tiredness and worries deep in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked her to the underground parking lot with a warm smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana left, Tom took a deep breath. Tobias had asked him to look after her, but she was doing just fine. She didn't need anyone's protection at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana drove straight home to work on her design sketches.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the spring collection was finalized before Christmas, she could finally enjoy a peaceful holiday.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The winter streets of Capitole were still bustling with life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shops were doing brisk business, and crowds of people filled the sidewalks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy watching couples wrapped in each other's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gazed at the bustling street, a smile gracing her lips. "It's great to be alive," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it's a snowy day, I can create my sunshine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there's no happiness, no love, then I'll just decide to be happy. It doesn't matter if love is absent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, it's okay. Everything is gradually getting better.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as I leave Steven's orbit and stop loving him, it really will be a sunny day."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="722.html">« Prev</a><a href="724.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
