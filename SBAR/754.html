Tonight, she was even more seductive than what he saw at noon. Her desire could hardly be contained under that thin dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was most disgusted by such women.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie liked to dress like that in front of him. When he saw it, he frowned slightly but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Queenie's freedom to dress. Steven suddenly thought of Diana. She had a good figure, much better than that of the woman in front of him. She once wore such a tight skirt, revealing her long, perfect legs, and all the men around her were looking at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was annoyed just by looking at that and warned her seriously that she was not allowed to dress like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Paula was also there, scolding Diana for being slutty, wondering if she was trying to seduce men.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt aggrieved and helpless. Paula's sharp words brought her to tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven thought of that, his chest hurt. It turned out that he had unknowingly developed a possessive desire for her, but he had never realized it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie was scantily clad, he just frowned slightly, and he didn't feel that she would be stared at and coveted by other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he would have that feeling towards Diana. He would be angry when he thought about other men looking at her legs. Since then, she had never dressed so sexily, and the dresses she had were all casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven tightened his grip on the wine glass slightly, and his solemn gaze made Yvette, who was sitting opposite him, feel a little fear deep down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette, however, had never been someone who would give up easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swore to get Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His exceedingly handsome face was mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette stood up and sat next to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smell of her perfume assaulted his nose, making him frown slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She boldly took his arm, but the moment she touched him, he stood up and warned in a low voice, "Ms. King, please behave yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Woah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Steven's indifferent expression, Yvette couldn't help laughing out of anger. She even doubted her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every man who saw her sexy body would be attracted to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was the first person to tell her to behave herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was really interesting, and it made her deeply interested in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got up with a smile on her red lips. "Mr. Gellar, then I'll leave you alone. I hope you'll consider our cooperation."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want him to hate her. It was only a matter of time before she got him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven did not say anything. He had already had his men investigate Yvette's interpersonal relationships. Everyone who approached him was related to those illegitimate children.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yvette would..." he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her back with a strange look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already met the important partner at tonight's banquet. He texted Evan to pick him up, and then he strode away from the banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, what just happened was photographed by Novia, who was the granddaughter of Jace and had a good relationship with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sent the picture to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Queenie, someone is seducing your fiance. She's the newly returned daughter of the Kings.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was out of surgery and back at the hotel to rest. When she saw the photo sent by Novia, she was so angry that she wanted to smash her phone. "How dare this woman seduce Steven when I was not around him?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looks like a player at first glance. She is scheming all over!" Queenie screamed inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sent a message to Novia.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Novia, thank you. I'll treat you to a meal when I have time.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, she sent messages to Diana along with the photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, aren't you quite capable? How come you can't even charm Steven and get this woman to seduce him?]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="753.html">« Prev</a><a href="755.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
