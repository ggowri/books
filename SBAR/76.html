Steven had never laid a hand on her before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, what are you doing? Put me down."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven tightened his grip on her legs, warning her, "Diana, if you want Aria Group to stay in business, you'd better stop struggling. A tiny company like that? I could bankrupt it overnight if I wanted to."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You..." Diana was stunned. She never dreamed Steven would threaten her with this. Thank goodness she hadn't revealed her true identity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his threat had the desired effect, Steven smugly carried Diana to the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It must have been her comment about Alexander being the most impressive man in her eyes that set him off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was why he was using such heavy-handed tactics now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once seated, Diana brushed off the places where Steven had touched her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mere sight of Steven now made her skin crawl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed her actions, his eyes darkening with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was disgusted by him!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up. I don't want to hear it. You need a woman, so I'll get Queenie to come keep you company."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana grabbed her phone, about to call Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face darkened instantly. He snatched the phone from her hand. "What does this have to do with Queenie? Why are you calling her? Have you lost your mind, Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His angry voice startled Diana. Diana said, "If your childhood sweetheart Queenie finds out I went home with you tonight, she'll definitely try to make my life hell tomorrow. You two are truly wicked to the core. Do you really have to torment me to feel happy?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana!" Steven bellowed, "Do you always have to be so damn harsh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And do you always have to be so low? You framed me time and time again. I'm your wife in name only, and you've never once had my back. Every single time, you're the one twisting the knife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you show your face to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh! I get it now. Judging by that sour look on your face, your stomach's acting up again, isn't it? You want to drag me back to be your free nurse. I've been your unpaid caretaker for two years, and you haven't given me a cent!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you dare play the marriage card!" Diana cut him off coldly. "You've never once acknowledged me as your wife. And don't give me that 'married couples don't pay each other' crap."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven furrowed his brow. This woman's sharp tongue was cutting him to the quick.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared intently at the unfamiliar emotions playing across her beautiful face. Diana before him today was so foreign that he made a double-take.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's phone rang. It was Luna.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luna, go home first. Tell my grandpa I'm fine and I'll be back later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna's voice was laced with worry. "Ms. Bishop, I saw Steven take you away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Just tell my grandpa I'm busy with company stuff. And don't tell my brother."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Luna agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up, only to hear Steven's ice-cold voice behind her. "You have a grandfather and an older brother? Why haven't you ever mentioned them to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A faint smile tugged at Diana's lips. "As if you ever cared. If it weren't for recent events, you probably wouldn't even remember what I look like."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched as Steven bristled like a hedgehog, his tone growing increasingly cold. "Diana, we can't talk if you're going to be like this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why should we talk? When you all framed me, when I wanted to talk things out, did you give me a chance? Did you let me explain?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly turned, moving to embrace Diana with an overwhelming intensity.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="75.html">« Prev</a><a href="77.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
