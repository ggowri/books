"Hubery, don't be mad. Just hear me out first. I'm not being lovesick - I just felt like now that the misunderstanding's cleared up, and I still have feelings for him, I'd give him one more shot."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hubery, please forgive him. Back then he didn't love me, and there's nothing wrong with not loving someone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery listened to her words and laughed bitterly. "You're totally lovesick. There's no saving you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without even looking at Steven, Hubery said, "I'll get the car. Taking you home to rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded eagerly. "Okay! Hubery, I'll wait for you here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana instantly transformed into a sweet, soft little girl. Hubery shook his head with a helpless smile and went to get the car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Steven. "Later, just let my brother yell at you a bit. You used to say awful things to me all the time - now it's your turn to take it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "I know I was wrong. I won't argue back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gripped her hand tightly, his gaze unwavering. "Diana, whatever Hubery says, I'll take it. I won't fight back. No one's going to tear us apart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was satisfied. "Good. That's the right attitude."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled softly. After putting her through so much pain before, he'd never let her suffer again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery pulled up quickly. After Diana and Steven got in, Hubery drove them home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hadn't been to Raventia in years - not much had changed. "Bro, I haven't been here in years. How come nothing's different? The plaza's still old, the facilities are still run-down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And that river over there - it's completely overgrown with weeds. Doesn't anyone maintain it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery chuckled. "We're all just passing through. Why worry about all that? What do you want for lunch? Should I take you guys somewhere to eat first?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked around at the shops - nothing appealed to her. That hand-grabbed rice had killed her appetite for two days, and with the exhausting competition, she had even less desire to eat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hubery, let's eat whatever you like. I don't know what's good around here. Wherever you take us, we'll eat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lamb pilaf?" Hubery glanced in the rearview mirror. She usually liked lamb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way." Diana's face twisted in disgust. "Hubery, I've been helping them with competitions for three days straight, eating hand-grabbed lamb rice every single day. I can't stomach it anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want cabbage, I want to drink collagen smoothies, and I'm craving something sour and spicy. I haven't been feeling great these past couple days - dizzy, tired, always wanting to sleep. Must be exhausted from the competition."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly looked at her with alarm, leaning closer. He felt a surge of excitement - these were all pregnancy symptoms. His grip on her hand tightened, squeezing until it hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana winced. "What's wrong? You're hurting my hand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was both nervous and thrilled. They'd been together for over a month now. He leaned close to Diana's ear and whispered, "Diana, craving sour and spicy food... could you be pregnant?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at him. "......"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was overthinking this. "Impossible." She quickly denied it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven wasn't as casual about it, carefully protecting her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed. "......"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The way he was being so cautious made it seem like she really was pregnant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery caught Steven's eye in the rearview mirror and warned, "Steven, don't you dare hurt Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "Hubery, I'm not hurting Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana started thinking about her symptoms - they really did seem like pregnancy signs. Had she gotten her period this month? She'd been so happy lately, she'd completely lost track of her cycle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uh oh...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked confused, meeting Steven's excited gaze. Steven was convinced this was it. Diana could feel his body trembling with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently pulled her into his arms, her head resting against his chest. She could hear his strong, rapid heartbeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery glanced at the two of them through the rearview mirror and shook his head slightly. In the end, it was Diana's choice. As long as she was happy and content, they would all respect her decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, let me take you guys for some seafood."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled brightly. "Sounds great, Hubery."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The temperature in downtown Raventia was starting to rise. Diana felt drowsy but still forced her eyes open to look at the gorgeous castles outside&mdash;they were absolutely stunning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ugh..." Diana suddenly dry-heaved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery slammed on the brakes and pulled over. Steven turned around anxiously. "Diana, are you carsick?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hubery, to the hospital," Steven said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana caught her breath and grabbed Steven's arm. "What hospital? I'm just exhausted from the past few days."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven wasn't having it. "Diana, listen to me. We're going to the hospital for a checkup. If you're pregnant, you're not doing anything dangerous anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could he have been so careless? How did he not think of this possibility?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pregnant?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why was he bringing this up again? For a moment, Diana's mind went completely blank. Her period... it was definitely late. Oh god...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could she really be pregnant?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery froze for a second, looking at Steven. "What do you mean, pregnant?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled faintly. "Hubery, your comprehension skills need work. You don't know what pregnant means?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery's gaze slowly focused on Diana's pale face, his eyes widening slightly. Sunlight streamed through the car window, illuminating her porcelain-white skin and delicate features&mdash;she looked like something out of a watercolor painting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then we're going to the hospital right now. I'm going to be an uncle," Hubery said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His lips curved into an involuntary smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head frantically. "No, no, no. We don't need to go yet. I'm probably just tired from the past couple days&mdash;not eating or sleeping well. If it's a false alarm, I'll die of embarrassment."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery got serious. "How can you not go to the hospital when you're feeling sick? You've been exhausted and miserable for days. We're getting you checked out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And just like that, Diana found herself being escorted to the hospital by two grown men. The hospital wasn't far, and once they arrived, Steven wouldn't even let her walk. She wasn't feeling great&mdash;she'd only had some fruit after coming down from the mountain that morning, and now she was both hungry and nauseous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana protested, "Put me down. I can walk. Being pregnant doesn't mean my legs are broken..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery cut her off. "Diana, don't talk nonsense. Just behave. We're almost there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly reached the obstetrics department. Hubery had gotten them an appointment with a specialist through the VIP track. Ten minutes later, Diana emerged from the bathroom holding a pregnancy test. Steven and Hubery were waiting outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed in disbelief. "Hubery, you pulled strings to get us the VIP treatment, and the doctor just handed me a pregnancy test?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery looked confused&mdash;he didn't really understand the process. He had a friend who worked here, which was why everything had been arranged so quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven was on edge. He walked over and grabbed her hands, his voice trembling slightly. "Diana, tell me now&mdash;are you pregnant or not?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1168.html">« Prev</a><a href="1170.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
