A memory flashed through Diana's mind: the woman Paula had confronted with such ferocity at Jace's birthday celebration was none other than Queenie's biological mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A faint smile graced Diana's lips. Paula might be well aware of the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This realization lifted her spirits, and she sent a message to Luna before resuming her meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon returning to his office, Steven found it difficult to settle his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person who had saved him from the fire was Diana, yet he distinctly remembered seeing Queenie. When he woke up, it was Queenie who had been at his bedside. He had always believed it was Queenie who had saved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven called Evan into his office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anything you need, Mr. Gellar?" Evan asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look into which hospital Diana went to for burn treatment after the fire."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan responded, "I'm aware of this. It was a hospital under Azure's name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was puzzled. "How do you know this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once, Ms. Bishop asked me to fetch her medication for scar hyperplasia from that hospital. I inquired about the medication's purpose, and the doctor informed me that Ms. Bishop had been admitted a year prior with severe burns. The scar hyperplasia and itchy wounds were why she needed the medication.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"During that time, your legs were in a bad state, and Ms. Bishop couldn't leave your side to get the medication herself. So, she asked for my help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">More than a year after the fire, Steven was involved in a serious car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was coincidentally recognized by the Marsh family. After Queenie's departure, Diana married Steven, only to be forced into a divorce two years later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What a twist of fate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked stern, and his lips were pressed tightly together. He finally figured out the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That year, when the wall of fire had come crashing down, he had felt someone leap onto him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had then lost consciousness, and upon waking, he found Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Investigate the people who accompanied Queenie to the suburbs that day. Why were they in that area?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why had Diana been nearby, too? At the time, she hadn't yet returned to the Marsh Villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan replied, "Understood, I'll head to the suburbs to look into it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Years had passed since the incident, making it challenging to trace the cause. Their only recourse was to contact the police officers who had handled the case, but the fire investigation remained unsolved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was in no state to work for the rest of the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold had dropped a time bomb and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, Diana had an appointment with Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander came to pick her up personally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cooperation contract with Alexander had been finalized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana still needed ten female models; her company also designed men's clothing, so male models were covered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, these ten female models were yet to be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, accompanied by Luna, went downstairs and saw Alexander waiting at the company's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stood out strikingly against the backdrop of the setting sun. His silhouette exuded a cool, noble air. Even the sleek lines of his tailored suit couldn't mask the austere aura that surrounded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana approached with a smile, drawn to his charisma. "Mr. Powell, thank you for coming to pick me up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled softly, fixing his eyes on her beautiful face, which lit up even more when she smiled. "Diana, we're quite familiar with each other now. Why the formal address?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="272.html">« Prev</a><a href="274.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
