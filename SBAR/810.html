No matter what happens, I&#x27;m ready to accept it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana put on her mask, tied her hair back in a ponytail, and pushed her up the stairs, with Luna discreetly keeping watch over them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Soon, they arrived at the women&#x27;s department on the third floor. Lily&#x27;s heart sank as she spotted Jean linked arm-in-arm with Amelie, sharing a moment as they browsed clothes together. In that instant, it felt as if all the blood in her body had turned to ice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily&#x27;s eyes were locked on the two, watching Jean chat with Amelie, their bond as intimate as that of mother and daughter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her heart raced painfully, a sharp ache seizing her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The daughter she had raised with such care was now so close to another woman.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had never imagined Jean could have such a relationship with Amelie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her hand trembled slightly on the armrest of her wheelchair as she stared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, she believed everything Diana had said. While she had been guiding Jean, Amelie had been driving a wedge between them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had thought Jean was simply rebellious, believing that patience would bring about change.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she was wrong. Some people were just heartless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Years of love had been squandered on two ungrateful children, not to mention her husband.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had thought Jean was acting out, never realizing there was a third party involved.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jean had been careful, never letting anything slip in front of her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily believed she had a happy family, putting in the effort to keep it that way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If she just took care of her family, surely happiness would follow.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But that was an illusion. The harsh truth was that Jean favored her father&#x27;s mistress.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Beneath her mask, her lips trembled, and the pain in her chest felt deep and heavy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yet, having faced many trials in life, her reason soon took over. If her bond with her children was so weak, perhaps it was best to let them go.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, push me closer. I want to hear what they&#x27;re saying,&quot; she whispered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Both of them were bundled up in masks and scarves, so no one would suspect them in the winter chill.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana pushed her nearer, bringing them within earshot.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Amelie, do you like this dress? I want to wear it to the club, and my friends will think I look sexy!&quot; Jean exclaimed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie smiled lovingly at her, gently stroking her hair. &quot;You look beautiful in anything. This dress is short, sexy, and fits you perfectly. Let&#x27;s get it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Great! You&#x27;re the best! I&#x27;m glad my mom is gone. She never let me wear stuff like this. She always said clubs are dangerous. But young people today are so open-minded! I was always stuck at home, but now that she&#x27;s gone, I feel so free. You&#x27;ll be my mom now, right? When are you and Dad getting married? I can&#x27;t wait to live with you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Each word from Jean pierced Lily&#x27;s heart like a knife.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jean had longed for Amelie to take her mother&#x27;s place.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With her head down, tears streamed down her face. At that moment, she accepted the painful reality, her heart aching.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a moment, she heard Amelie reply, &quot;Sweetheart, I want that too, but I need to sort out your mom&#x27;s situation before I can marry your dad.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Even in death, she won&#x27;t leave us in peace. Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ll handle it. Tomorrow, I&#x27;ll report Diana again for killing my mom. We&#x27;ve found new evidence, and everything points to her. Once we wrap up Mom&#x27;s case, our family of four can finally be happy together.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="809.html">« Prev</a><a href="811.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
