It was Diana and Mr. Diken Toby who got him out. Steven, was your evidence delivered too late? Diana is truly shameless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's voice was somewhat heavy. "Maybe. As long as he's okay, that's all that matters. As a good friend, I just want him to be safe. No matter who rescued him, we did our part to help."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Yanson breathed a sigh of relief, thinking, "Steven does care about us, unlike what Owen said, that he would use us as stepping stones. Owen must have misunderstood Steven and Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, does that collaboration you mentioned before still count?" he asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George smiled and said, "Of course. When have my words ever not counted? However, Diana has taken everything from me. She now has a piece of land to develop. If she succeeds, it will greatly affect us. We need to find a way to stop her. You're the best at this. I want her construction site unable to start."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson said, "I remember that piece of land was bought from Elroy. Leave this matter to me. I won't let her successfully develop that land."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But, Steven, Owen firmly believes that Queenie framed him and says both of his branch companies were taken by Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needs to figure out who is telling the truth in this matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If something like what happened to Owen happened to Yanson, only Steven could save him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is very cautious when drinking out and very alert when driving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George smiled and explained, "Yanson, if we don't acquire them, his two branch companies will be taken by someone else. Yanson, this is the rule of business. Even if we don't acquire them, someone else will take them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson let go of his doubts. He didn't trust Owen much, but he definitely trusted Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I understand. I'll cause trouble for Diana. Don't worry. Just wait for my good news. When we work together, I'll count on you," Yanson said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George responded, "Don't worry. We will definitely work together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson smiled and said, "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Since Steven has already said so, I have nothing to fear."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Yanson left the police station.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Queenie was in a good mood, resting on the sofa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George put away his phone. Sitting beside her, his eyes were filled with anger. "It was Diana who helped Owen. Diana hates Owen. Why would she help Owen?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sneered, "It's fine. We'll have another chance to take Owen's other companies next time. The two subsidiaries we've already taken are the most profitable ones in Owen's hands. As for Yanson, the companies we're currently collaborating with him on are making good money. We need to wait a bit before taking them away. Yanson and Dylan are still very useful. Don't you want Diana dead? Dylan is the perfect scapegoat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George understood. He lowered his head, kissed her lips, and then said in a deep voice, "Then we'll wait for my dad to finish things over there. Once he's succeeded, Diana's end will come."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled, then wrapped her arms around George's neck and kissed him proactively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana dropped Owen and Diken off at the company, where they got busy handling business matters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting out of the car, Owen looked at Diana and said, "Diana, I don't have time to treat you to a meal today. Once I finish dealing with the company's matters, I'll find you and thank you for what you did for me today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana calmly said, "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen happily waved at her, then went to the company with Diken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Owen and Diken leave, Luna was shocked. "Diana, Owen changes so quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick responded, "Diana saved his life. How could he not change? If Diana hadn't personally helped him, he would already be in prison, and his company would have been divided up. Now, he has only lost two branches, but his foundation is still intact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna snorted coldly and said, "I just hope Owen knows how to be grateful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Diana said relaxedly, "Whether he changes or not, we have one less enemy. Let's go home and wait for Queenie to make her next move."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, thinking, "Queenie, the real show is yet to come."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Diana went home with the two of them, where Steven was waiting for them in the hall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana, the worry in his eyes instantly disappeared. "Diana, you're back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing the change in his gaze, Diana felt a bit stifled inside, realizing he had been worried about her just now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Owen is fine now. Queenie just took over two of his branch companies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently said, "It's okay. In some time, they'll be back in Owen's hands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "This won't be something I want to handle in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a busy day, Diana was very hungry. She immediately looked at Luna. "Luna, let's cook. I'm starving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna replied, "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Nick and Evan's help, Luna prepared a table full of food in forty minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana loved shrimp, ate three big ones, and was full.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Luna, Diana said, "Luna, when summer comes, let's go out to sea for a few days and catch some deep-sea lobsters. They're really delicious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt very satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna smiled and said, "Diana, it's too dangerous for you to go into the sea alone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "This year is different. Julius is coming back. By then, I'll have him go to sea with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Diana happily made the decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "By then, I want to go too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and asked, "Can you dive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "I'm learning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at his injured leg, Diana said, "That's not something you can learn in a short time. I grew up by the sea. Diving is my only hobby. I love watching the coral and schools of fish in the ocean. It's a breathtaking sight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna looked at her enviously because she only dared to stay in shallow water. In deep water, she would feel extremely uneasy and scared. So, she wasn't suited for diving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick often went diving with Diana when he was young. "Diana, take me with you this time too. You used to take me to the sea all the time when we were kids."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "When we were kids, I took you along because I was scared. This time, I'll take you with me. You're great at catching octopus. Catch more of them. When we get back, I'll cook something delicious for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nowadays, their lives seem to be all about being busy, with nothing else going on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For months, she had already gotten used to this busy life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick was very happy. "Alright. I'll start preparing once Julius comes back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dinner, Luna, Nick, and Evan left, leaving only Diana and Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat on the sofa, chatting with someone, looking very happy. Steven felt a bit jealous because she was still cold toward him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slowly said, "Diana, come here for a moment. I need to talk to you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1068.html">« Prev</a><a href="1070.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
