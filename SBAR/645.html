Every time they met, it was very secret. She really had no idea how Lily had found out about their affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie shook her head and said, "Mrs. Foliot, my affair with Mark was a misunderstanding. Please, don't damage my reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled contemptuously, "You are just a bitch. Do you still care about your reputation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was really afraid of Lily, who was different from Paula. Paula, outwardly cold but inwardly gentle, didn't have a temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Lily was arrogant and irritable. Once something convinced her, she would pursue it to the end. Last time, she caught Amelie in the act at the club.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie shook her head quickly and said, "Mrs. Foliot, what happened last time was really a misunderstanding. Please don't blame me. I really have nothing to do with Mr. Foliot. The man I love has always been Jeff."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, Jeff was used as a shield again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sneered and ignored her. The exciting part would come later.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, I'm sorry for the scene. We have prepared delicious food inside. Please come in. There will also be a good show."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was surprised. Was Lily not going to vent her anger on her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, based on her understanding of Lily, she would not let things go easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie glanced at Queenie, who was ashamed and dizzy at that moment. From the time of her birth to the present, she had never been more humiliated.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was embarrassed as people around him were gossiping about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he noticed that Diana remained indifferent, his heart suddenly sank. Her hateful words suggested that she would never feel relieved until they died.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula grinned brightly with her head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie planned to make her a mental patient, but it was impossible. There was still something more interesting waiting for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was just the beginning. The prouder she was, the more miserable her life would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her movie was released, Paula would give her a big gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone entered the banquet hall together. Queenie realized that Diana was also there and that she had just seen what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's friend, Jasmine, approached her and smiled, "Queenie, I saw everything just now. Don't worry. Diana will soon get into trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glared at Diana with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What qualifications did Diana have to attend such a high-end banquet?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at Jasmine beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasmine, you know that Diana is always causing trouble and that she's very close to Cecil."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was well aware that the man whom Jasmine most wished to marry was Cecil.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Diana was on good terms with him, her doom was looming.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine's father wanted to marry her into the Farley family.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine blocked Diana's way, stared at her haughtily, and mocked, "Diana, this is the Foliot family's banquet. It's not for small potatoes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice calling for Diana caught everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula immediately fixed her eyes on Diana. She was dressed in a black dress that outlined her perfect figure and made her skin look even smoother. Her eyes were starry and watery. She was beautiful. However, she was unwilling to pay any attention to Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and stood in front of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was nervous. If he revealed his marriage to Diana here, she would be confirmed as a mistress.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="644.html">« Prev</a><a href="646.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
