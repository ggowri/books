She suddenly remembered that Diana had gone to Woodston to rescue Cecil. Queenie thought she had done it perfectly, but at this moment, her pride over the years was shattered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it. Did Diana know about this during the trip?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Diana had noticed her plan at that time, then what about Paula's company?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something flashed across Queenie's mind, but she couldn't grasp it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's long silence worried George. He said, "Queenie, why don't you say anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie came back to her senses and slowly explained, "Something went wrong when acquiring Jace's branch, but it's under my control. It's fine now. Felicity will handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we will suffer heavy losses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie held his hand tightly and said solemnly, "George, we have to speed up. It seems we have won in the acquisition, but it's all in vain. George, I betrayed Steven and tried to kill him many times on your account. George, please don't let me lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's hands trembled slightly. She had also miscalculated when acquiring Wyatt's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These had dealt her a heavy blow. Starting from Paula's company, no, it should be from Cecil, and she seemed to have been failing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled gently and said, "Queenie, it's not in vain. These companies can make more money in our hands within two years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie did not respond to him. At this moment, she was doubting herself. Who gave her the confidence before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she do this without hesitation for George or herself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie recalled George committed suicide in front of Diana's grave and felt a lump in her throat, saying in a choked voice, "George, do you love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asking this question seemed to have drained her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head and looked at George quietly. He was the man she fell in love with when she was young and ignorant. Tears coursed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George and Steven look almost identical. They had the same sharp and handsome faces. People who were not familiar with them couldn't tell them apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled gently and tilted his head slightly. Queenie could see his Adam's apple </span><span>trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was very tender. "Queenie, don't you know whether I love you or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath and wiped away the tears on her face. In the dream, George was forced to commit suicide because he betrayed her, and she became the business queen as she wished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath. That was her dream, and no one could stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George didn't know what Queenie was thinking. He failed to figure her out now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled and reminded her, "Queenie, don't worry too much. There will be a top business summit after the New Year. At that time, many bigwigs in the business world will gather there, and we can find a better way out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew about this summit. The guests invited were entrepreneurs from Capitole and wealthy people from all over the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This summit would give them the best opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, you will be able to get the funds with Steven's identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prospect cheered Queenie up quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled and said, "Yes, we will have many opportunities at this summit. The income from exports is also very good. Foreign technology companies can give great support to our domestic technology companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For example, the medical AI system that Diana mentioned. You have talents in this field and can develop a medical AI system before the summit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as Diana's team loses, we will win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie instantly got excited. That was right. It took Diana's team two years to develop the system, but she had better experts than Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie instantly became interested. She asked Mario to take care of this before asking George to drive home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George asked, "Queenie, shall we go back to the apartment or go to your mother's place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of her mom annoyed Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her words, her cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie saw it was her mother calling, she felt inexplicably irritated. Nothing good had happened since she received calls from her mother recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello. Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, come back. Your dad went mad. He secretly planned to steal Mark's company. The company belongs to Noah. That's Noah's father. Noah's overseas company was taken, and so was Mark's company. Your dad is a bastard. How dare he do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shocked. Jeff had been quiet for some time, but he had secretly plotted such a conspiracy to take away Mark's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was surprised by her dad's method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and said, "Isn't this great?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was her father. Of course, she sided with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you can't blame Dad. You betrayed him first and cheated on him. You only care about your son. Don't you care about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's tone was cold and sarcastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words upset Amelie. "Queenie, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, "What do I mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't you know what I mean? You broke my happiness. I don't blame you, but you blame me instead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of you, I betrayed Paula, who adored me. But what did you do behind my back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even my brother is not my dad's child. I have been wishing to have a happy family, but you ruined it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie used to be the little princess in Paula's family, cherished by four brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now she no longer felt that kind of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she had was the humiliation and embarrassment her mother brought upon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was aggrieved. "Queenie, how can you accuse me? Others don't understand me. You are my daughter. Don't you understand my situation? Queenie, I wanted to be a good woman, but your father didn't allow me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't listen to her long speech and hung up the phone. "George, let's go to my mother's villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George said, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula received a message from Lily in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Paula, I have some good news to share with you. Your ex-husband didn't let me down. He took away Mark's company. Mark is now kneeling in front of my house and crying.]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="943.html">« Prev</a><a href="945.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
