Nearly dying had left her with a newfound tranquility. "Mark, even your daughter considers Amelie her mother. Just sign the papers and let them go find their 'mom' without any delay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. I only acknowledge Amelie as my mother. She treats me well. She lets me go to bars and supports me in anything dangerous I want to do, not like you. You kept me trapped in some cozy greenhouse and wouldn't let me go to bars; ride motorbikes with friends, stay at hotels or even date. Who would like a mother like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And anyway, it's the one who's unloved who's the mistress. My dad and Amelie are the ones who are truly in love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily took a deep breath. "I see. Well, since you don't like me, I'm stepping aside for you, aren't I? If you can just convince your father to sign, we can get this divorce settled. Then no one will stop you from going to bars or to hotels with men. You'll be completely free to do whatever you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean was taken aback; she hadn't expected Lily to agree so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, every time Mark had proposed divorce, Lily had insisted she would never agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Lily's sudden willingness, Jean found herself at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily didn't spare her another glance. Instead, she turned to Mark. "Mark, you cheated first. If you're hesitating, is it because you can't bear to part with my family's wealth or our partnership?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." He certainly could not bear to lose the collaboration with Lily's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those connections were what had built his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was done wasting words. "Mark, sign the papers. Your daughter is waiting impatiently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean bit her lip, looking at Lily. There was something unfamiliar in her gaze, a coldness that had never been there before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mark hesitated, Lily's expression turned mocking. "Mark, let's end things cleanly. You've been living off my family for years now, isn't that enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark's face went pale. Just as he was about to speak, Lily continued, "Mark, so many people are watching. After a lifetime of living off someone else's wealth, don't you feel any shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark bristled at her words, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Lily. Nothing infuriated him more than the idea of being a "kept man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, it was the most disgraceful role a man could play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd built his company on the strength of her family's influence. But that didn't mean he was willing to be humiliated for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always hated the idea that this dependency could be used against him, and now, with his recent behavior coming to light, people were bound to say he was ungrateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, what nonsense are you talking about? No wonder the kids don't like you. You're showing such an ugly side of yourself now! You used to be harsh, but never this petty and cruel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily faced him, unbothered. "I'm not being cruel. I'm just stating facts. The children's dislike of me isn't due to poor parenting on my part. It's because of your mistress. I kept strict boundaries because I wanted them to have a good future. Their journey ahead is long, and I wanted them to be prepared for it. But what about the woman you're involved with?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever I forbid, she encourages. I don't want my kids spending their time in bars, yet she fully supports it. How am I supposed to manage them under those circumstances? I can't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now, since my strictness is such a problem, I'm stepping aside to let the person who loves them so dearly handle their upbringing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Mark, I'm letting you all go. Please sign the papers."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="822.html">« Prev</a><a href="824.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
