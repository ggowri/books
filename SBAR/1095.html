If you take this information to Queenie, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll be killed. Just like Frank. If you insist on being stubborn, I won</span><span>'</span><span>t help you anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan trembled all over. He couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe that the Queenie they had adored since childhood could be so cruel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric looked at the officer and said, "Officer, please take him away. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll provide the surveillance footage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer said, "Sir, please cooperate with our investigation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric said, "Fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan suddenly shoved past an officer and bolted outside. He refused to believe Queenie would kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to find Queenie. He couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t go to jail. He couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t live with the label of a thief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Eric is such a bastard. Why did he call the cops? We could</span><span>'</span><span>ve handled this privately. He just wants to ruin me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan ran. It was the last thing anyone expected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric followed the cops, chasing after him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan jumped on his bike. Being a skilled rider, he quickly disappeared into the city streets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cops pulled up street footage. Dylan was heading toward Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan banged on Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s door, hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Mario had been together many times tonight. Feeling great, Queenie went to bed early with Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly woken by the banging, Queenie sat up, annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Who</span><span>'</span><span>s knocking this late? Psycho."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario woke up too. Hearing the frantic knocking, he instantly knew something was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Queenie, noticing the marks he</span><span>'</span><span>d left on her. A smug satisfaction spread across his face. "Queenie, put some clothes on first. Something</span><span>'</span><span>s probably up. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll go with you to check."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought about having Dylan steal Paula's company secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Did he get caught? Idiot. He can</span><span>'</span><span>t even handle a simple task."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also planned to pin all the blame on him, but she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t expect George</span><span>'</span><span>s situation to escalate so quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It caught her off guard, leaving her no choice but to send Dylan to steal Paula's company secrets first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie got dressed and went to the door with Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The door opened, and there stood a flustered Dylan. Both of them frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan stared at the two, their disheveled appearance making him freeze for a moment. Then he shouted, "Queenie, how could you? George just got caught, and you</span><span>'</span><span>re already jumping into Mario</span><span>'</span><span>s arms?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan might be selfish, but Queenie's actions still left him genuinely shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was fully aware of the relationship between the two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie adjusted her clothes and snapped, "Dylan, this is my business, not yours. Why are you here so late? What do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan remembered Eric's words and deliberately said, "Queenie, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you ask me to steal the company</span><span>'</span><span>s secrets? I</span><span>'</span><span>ve got them. They</span><span>'</span><span>re on my phone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie exchanged a glance with Mario. She smiled and said, "Dylan, thank you. Send me the files, will you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan said, "Alright! I</span><span>'</span><span>ll send them to you in a bit. What do you want me to do next?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled faintly, saying nothing. She walked up to Dylan and slapped him across the face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan froze, stumbling back a step in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smirked and asked, "Queenie, I got you everything you wanted. Why</span><span>'</span><span>d you slap me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "Idiot, I was just using you. Did you really think I saw you as my brother?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it weren</span><span>'</span><span>t for Diana ruining my plan, the four of you would</span><span>'</span><span>ve been dead already. My plan was flawless, and yet I lost to some nobody. You all deserve to die. Your existence is a reminder of my failure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I</span><span>'</span><span>ll have someone send you off to deep-sea fishing. In six months, you could make around half a million dollars. If you</span><span>'</span><span>re lucky, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll survive. If not, well, stay out there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan had only been testing Queenie. But hearing her words at this moment, he still found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked sadly, "Queenie, do you really want me dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even at this moment, Dylan still clung to hope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie let out a cold laugh. Watching his foolish expression, she leaned in slightly, her eyes fixed on him. "Dylan, out of the four of you, you</span><span>'</span><span>re the dumbest and the most selfish. When I framed Diana, you even helped me. She</span><span>'</span><span>s your own sister, yet you still sided with me to bring her down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, I knew it. As long as I dangled money in front of you, you wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t even spare your own mother. I tempted you with cash, and look, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you just steal those business secrets for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, don</span><span>'</span><span>t be sad. After all, you</span><span>'</span><span>re just too selfish. Someone as selfish as you would ruin me if you ever betrayed me in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll just have to join Frank in the ocean."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was startled by the venomous look on Queenie's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laughed and cried at the same time, feeling like Queenie was a demon baring her fangs. It sent shivers down his spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "No, no, it</span><span>'</span><span>s not like this. Queenie, I spoiled you so much, even hurt my own family for you. How could you do this to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, you</span><span>'</span><span>re the girl Mom cared for so tenderly. How can you be so ungrateful?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan finally believed what Eric had said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the truth could truly teach him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie openly admitted it, smiling smugly. "Dylan, so what if I</span><span>'</span><span>m ungrateful? And not just that, I</span><span>'</span><span>m going to take everything Paula has. It all belongs to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression grew more twisted by the second. In that moment, Dylan truly understood what it meant to feel heart-wrenching pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was furious, but there was nothing he could do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of all the pain Diana had endured, he said bitterly, "Queenie, you</span><span>'</span><span>re going to hell. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll go to prison, but I</span><span>'</span><span>ll watch you die with my own eyes. Killing you is pointless&mdash;living will hurt you more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked a bit surprised and asked, "Dylan, what</span><span>'</span><span>s that supposed to mean?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1094.html">Â« Prev</a><a href="1096.html">Next Â»</a></div></div></body></html>
