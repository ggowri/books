Paige, as long as we don't stick to morality, nothing can bind us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige wiped the tears from her face and thought Diana was right. She nodded. "Diana, everyone saw Queenie's hypocritical face, but the Marsh family and... They can't see it clearly." She didn't say the name "Steven".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige continued, "You should have seen the news from the past two days. Steven is trying to make Queenie famous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a dense pain in her heart. She wanted to control her feelings but failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remained calm, shook her head, and said, "I'm fine, Paige. I've let it go. I'll send you my cooperation plan tomorrow morning. When are you going to the company?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige's eyes flashed with intense hatred, "I planned to leave in three days and go to the island to relax for a few days, but before I leave, I have to do something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana guessed what Paige wanted to do. Whatever she could find out, Paige could also find out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Frank's wedding will probably be interesting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige sneered, "I'm sure it will be. I want to see if Frank and Elsie's love is so deep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Paige, the result may let you down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige suddenly felt depressed. Frank was stubborn. Even if he knew about what Elsie had done before, he would continue to love her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Paige didn't want to let the two go. She was still in anger after Elsie had framed her last time. Fortunately, nothing could affect her plans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige and Diana went to another restaurant to have dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Paige's driver came to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna also came to pick up Diana. Diana leaned against the car window. Her eyes were cold and a little blank, without any emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna looked at Diana from the rearview mirror and felt distressed for her. "Diana, did something unhappy happen tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana heard this and came back to her senses. "No. What's wrong?" Her voice was hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna said, "It hurts to see you look listless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "I'm just a little tired. I'll be fine after having a rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, she didn't know why she was in a bad mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna thought, "Diana looks sad perhaps because of Steven's high-profile support of Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna said, "Diana, Queenie is a gold digger, and Steven is a scumbag. You don't have to feel sad because of them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked disappointed. "Luna, I have indeed been hurt by them, and I did love Steven. He was the first man I fell in love with in my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't say anymore. She had decided to forget Steven, and she really had forgotten him, but she would still feel heartbroken when her memory of him had been triggered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana leaned back to rest, and Luna did not disturb her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna thought, "Fortunately, Diana is no longer willing to suffer injustice, and she finally has learned to fight back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Busy days went by quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cooperation with Alexander was proceeding smoothly, and the cooperation with Paige's family had also been&nbsp;realized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were then male models. Their assistants led them and left with Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had learned about the cooperation between Diana and Paige's family, and Frank guessed that Diana must have said something to Paige so that Paige alienated him. The next day, Frank went to see Paige and talked about the cooperation between the two companies. His company had male models, but Paige refused his cooperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he came out, he happened to meet Diana and Nolan, who came to sign a contract with Paige.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="289.html">« Prev</a><a href="291.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
