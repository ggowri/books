"Evan, shut up right now," he demanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Each of Evan's words was a direct reminder of how low Steven had sunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had already said everything he wanted, feeling quite satisfied inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Holding it in had been unbearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If venting felt this good, why wouldn't he indulge himself a bit?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was delighted, grinning widely as he considered opening a bottle of red wine to celebrate that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven fell completely silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Cecil finished lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil handled Diana's discharge procedures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He arranged a hotel for Diana and Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He escorted them to the hotel, which was right across from his apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The hotel suite was a presidential one, luxuriously decorated and very comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hadn't fully recovered yet. After sitting down, she said, "Cecil, thank you! The day after tomorrow is Mr. Foliot's birthday, so we need to leave tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil looked exhausted. This time, the other side had used members of the Chaos League, making it nearly impossible to identify the mastermind behind the scenes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, our branch has suffered major losses recently. Because of my incident, we lost another deal, and now the shareholders are questioning my capabilities. Grandma faces constant pressure at the morning meetings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Being so old and still having to handle his troubles was hard on Helen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana leaned back on the couch, a cold smile on her face. "Queenie tried to set you up but failed. Her only option now is to destroy you; she can't let you become her obstacle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was also troubled, feeling that she had been one step too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her tone was somber. "Your family will face more troubles ahead. We'll have to take a different approach to find out which company Queenie is backing. Woodston seems to be our best chance now. Today and tomorrow, let's check which company stole your previous deal. Whoever you're most familiar with among their reps, let's offer some money. Once we know who they are, we can trace the line back to the company owner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil shook his head. "I've tried that already. Do you know what their reason was? They offered one percent more profit, just to avoid exposing their partner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"They added that condition to the deal just to prevent me from finding out who they are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana gazed at him intensely, then smiled. "Cecil, you have to push harder. We have two more days. There must be a clue somewhere. I'll sleep for an hour, then meet me in the hotel lobby so we can continue."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing how tired Diana still was, Cecil nodded. "Alright! Get some rest." Cecil stood up and left, his once-reckless demeanor seeming much more mature now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Cecil left, Diana removed her shoes and lay on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The effects of the medicine were still there, leaving her feeling weak all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna came over with the medicine, handing it to her. "Ms. Bishop, please take your medicine first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sat up, took the water, and swallowed the medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna then took out a tablet and handed it to Diana. "Ms. Bishop, I checked Cecil's contacts again this morning. One of them has seen this woman before. Take a look."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="190.html">« Prev</a><a href="192.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
