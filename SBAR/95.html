Have someone keep an eye on Diana's every move, especially when Queenie goes to see her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir." Evan immediately went to carry out the orders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked out the window. In the twilight, his eyes were as unfathomable as the sea.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doorbell rang when Queenie's family finished dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing it was Penelope, Queenie ran happily to open the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She guessed right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Penelope, come on in," Queenie turned to shout, "Mom, Gale, Penelope is here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was sitting in the living room drinking coffee. Her gaze darkened slightly the moment she heard this name.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does Gale still have contact with this woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale ran down excitedly straight to Penelope, looking at her beautiful face with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Penelope, you're here. Come on in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope walked in happily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Paula was also there, she walked over with a smile, "Mrs. Marsh, nice to meet you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She placed the cosmetics she had brought in front of Paula and said politely, "This is a gift for you. Please accept it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula glanced at her indifferently. "She came over so late surely for something important. "Thank you, Penelope."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope was slightly surprised to see Paula wasn't as glad as she used to be. She was happy enough to see her hang out with Gale before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope said with a shy smile, "Mrs. Marsh, Gale, I came over today to tell you something important."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula suddenly had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale caught the subtle expressions on Penelope's face. "Had she agreed to marry me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very excited. "Penelope, what's it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope gently caressed her belly while looking up at Gale. "Gale, do you remember what happened at the hotel two months ago? I'm pregnant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've been careless and not until a couple of days ago </span><span>did</span><span> I discover it. I went to the hospital today for a check-up to confirm it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale shed tears out of excitement. He had liked Penelope for a very long time and always wanted to marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't like that woman who had grown up with him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But half a year ago, Diana conspired with that woman to plot against him and made him lose his virginity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always felt guilty towards Penelope. Now that she was carrying his child, he could finally marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was stunned. She always wanted Althea to be her son's wife. Yet, after that incident half a year ago, she was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of that incident, her eldest son hated Althea and Diana even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope used to be a delinquent back in school who had never attended classes properly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frequently went to have fun in nightclubs. "How could Gale like such a woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula suddenly recalled Diana's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than a year, she and her children would all be ruined.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="94.html">« Prev</a><a href="96.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
