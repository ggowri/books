It seemed like he still didn't fully grasp what she had just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea would never forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't say anything at first. Instead, she picked up the cup next to her, took the lid off, and drank a sip of water to soothe her throat. It still burned, the inflammation in her tonsils making it hard to talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice was steady and firm when she spoke. "No, she won't forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's emotions flared up in an instant, but his legs were in pain, and his mind was sharp. His mother's words rang in his head, louder than anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He closed his eyes in despair, regret overwhelming him, but it was too late to fix things now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula sighed quietly, watching him. "Gale, don't be upset. The most important thing is to get yourself healthy first. Only when you're well can you handle everything else. Forget about everything else for now and focus on getting better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had once lowered her guard, allowing Queenie and Jeff to feel comfortable, but now her business was thriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From now on, she planned to keep a low profile. She wouldn't do anything that would attract unnecessary attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie might want to rise higher, but Paula wasn't going to let her succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Andrew, having heard about Steven's accident, called George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"George, it's time to come back. I've already set everything up for you. Queenie hasn't disappointed you. Steven's in the hospital right now. And coincidentally, it's a hospital that the Gellar Group owns. The private jet is already on its way to pick you up. Get ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's voice was full of excitement. "Okay, Dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice sounded remarkably similar to Steven's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the surgery, Steven was quietly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan, who had been watching from the shadows, was stunned and followed them without making a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had slept for three whole days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she woke up, she felt disoriented, as though she had been asleep for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you're awake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana heard Olivia's voice and immediately felt a wave of relief. "Olivia, you're back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice was hoarse, and she was still a little out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew exactly what had happened. It was just a minor fracture in her calf. Thanks to Steven shielding her, it wasn't worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt sore all over. "Olivia, how long have I been asleep?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia frowned. "You've been out for three days. I was so worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I landed, I heard you were in danger, so I rushed here. And, of course, you'd already gotten hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia's eyes softened. "How are you feeling now? Is there anything else hurting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned. "No way. Just my calf. There's nothing else. How could it be three days?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And what about Steven? Is he okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia's expression darkened as she heard Diana still thinking about Steven. "You're still concerned about that jerk? You've been lying here for three days, and he didn't even bother to visit you once. It's always Queenie by his side. They're practically inseparable. It's all over the news now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Diana laughed bitterly. "I even thanked him for protecting me when it mattered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana closed her eyes in frustration. As she had feared, Steven would never be able to let go of Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what Queenie did, he would always forgive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia watched her with a heavy heart, unsure of what kind of disaster Steven was really facing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her emotions were conflicted, but Diana was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't understand why she had slept for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Olivia, did I really sleep for three days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia nodded. "Yes, you did. I went straight to the hospital from the airport. When I arrived at your room, you were already asleep. The doctors told me that the accident caused a severe impact, and you'd need to sleep longer to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm just glad you're awake. Don't think too much right now. Focus on getting better. There are plenty of other men in the world. If Steven doesn't love you, there's no point in forcing it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had already let go a long time ago. She smiled, a little weakly but sincere. "Alright, Olivia, I'll listen to you. I'm so hungry though. Could you help me get something to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia stood up. "I've already ordered takeout. It should be here soon. I'll go grab it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go get some water for you to wash up first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana needed to use the bathroom, so she asked Olivia to help her to the shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her left leg was in a cast, making it hard to walk, so Olivia had prepared a wheelchair for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After helping Diana with her wash-up, Olivia went downstairs to get the food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana picked up her phone and checked the trending topics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, there was news about Steven's car accident and how Queenie had been with him, never leaving his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The comments were filled with people speculating that they were a couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Queenie's agency fueling the fire, the two had become a public love story, trending all over the internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, Diana, are you reading the news?" Queenie's arrogant voice sounded from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana put her phone down and looked up at Queenie, who stood there radiating confidence. She was dressed to the nines in a white dress and tall boots, looking fashionably perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With an air of superiority, Queenie stepped inside, her gaze descending on Diana as if she were looking at someone beneath her. "Diana, do you see this? No matter how I change, Steven still loves me just the same. Are you finally facing the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a little sickened by the obvious attempt to flaunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judging from her proud stride and the sly smile on her face, Diana knew exactly what she was expecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, I wish you both will always be together!" Diana replied, her smile bright and her eyes clear, but there was not a trace of emotion in them, calm and unmoving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's attempt to flaunt her relationship felt like it had hit a soft pillow, leaving her feeling strangely unsatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "Diana, are you sad now? No matter what you do, Steven will never stand by your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Queenie, we're not the same kind of person. I won't force someone who doesn't love me. The reason I didn't let go earlier was because of his eye condition. The day before the kidnapping, he took the last dose of medicine, and his eyes were cured. That was my final act of love for him, and that's why I let go. I've already let you have him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't need to come here and gloat. All it does is make you look like a clown."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always hoped for them to be together. After all, it was the fate she and Steven had shared in the past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's fate had always been death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie never expected Diana to be this calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you're all alone now. Why are you so composed? Your parents don't want you, and neither does your lover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's calm only served to highlight how weak Queenie had been before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a faint smile, Diana replied, "Queenie, isn't this exactly what you wanted? I don't want any of them anymore. They're all yours now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="900.html">« Prev</a><a href="902.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
