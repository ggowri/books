Her design sketches lay scattered on the floor, a few of them torn to shreds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was still ripping apart the new designs she had painstakingly crafted just the day before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fury surged through her as Diana confronted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how important these designs are to me? I spent days on them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale tossed one of the crumpled sketches at her, his eyes oozing disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you think a country bumpkin like you can actually design clothes? Queenie wants to enter the designer competition, and I won't let you, the trashy little nobody, ruin her shot at success."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A fire ignited in Diana's gaze as she raised her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sound of her slap echoed in the room, leaving Gale momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Y... You hit me?" he stammered, his voice trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Damn right I did! Do I need a special occasion to smack you? You're throwing my future away for Queenie, and you expect me to just take it? I've been too nice to you for too long. I let you walk all over me, and now you think you can just destroy everything I've worked for? I should have left you to die in that car wreck. I saved you, only for Queenie to swoop in and steal my credit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Diana seized Gale's arm, and before he could react, she executed a powerful shoulder throw, sending him crashing to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale gasped in pain, staring at her with wide eyes. She was stronger than he had anticipated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's expression was icy, tears brimming in her eyes as she spoke slowly, each word laced with hatred, "You claim Queenie saved you? Go ask her if she could carry you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, today you've destroyed my designs, and I won't blame you for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your fate was sealed long ago. I'll enjoy watching Queenie ruin you one by one. Now get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She kicked his arm for good measure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale winced, grimacing at the pain. "Ah... It was you who took her credit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sure, I may have taken her credit, but I've already cut ties with the Marsh family. Why can't you let it go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What does Queenie's future have to do with mine? Why the hell would you destroy my chances for her? Gale, you're not even human. Get out of here; I don't want to see your face again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After her outburst, Diana knelt down, staring at the wreckage of her designs, utterly drained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These sketches represented countless hours of hard work, now reduced to scraps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale sat up, baring his teeth in frustration as he watched her anguish. He felt torn, unable to discern who was telling the truth&mdash;Queenie or Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, if you saved me, where's your proof?" he challenged, unwilling to back down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "How could someone so cruel possibly have saved me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shot up, her eyes blazing. "Get out. Now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without wasting another moment, she called security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello! Ms. Bishop here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana fumed. "Didn't I make it clear last time? I said no one from the Marsh family is allowed in here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The security officer replied nervously, "Uh, Ms. Bishop, I'm really sorry, but I had a stomach issue this morning. While I was in the restroom, he must have slipped in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fuming, Diana hung up the phone, her gaze locking on Gale, who was still seething with resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, if Queenie wants to climb to success on my back, she's dreaming. I won't let you two succeed at my expense."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="169.html">« Prev</a><a href="171.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
