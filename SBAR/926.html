Sometimes, he asks about Steven and, occasionally, Mr. Powell. He really cares about your future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, understanding his good intentions. "I understand what you mean, but this jewelry set is just too expensive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew better than to accept such a valuable gift without reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, when she first met Alexander, she had made it clear. This wasn't a matchmaking meeting but a collaboration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about Alexander asking her about the details of her divorce certificate made her heart tighten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna could see Diana's hesitation. Navigating such exchanges wasn't her forte either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, just keep it for now. When the opportunity arises, you can return it to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "That's the only option. Remember to take it back later and lock it in the safe. When there's a chance, we'll return it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he doesn't accept, then find out if he needs anything. We need to settle this favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She disliked owing anyone anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She much preferred others owing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna chuckled, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Nolan and Joseph walked in carrying bags.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't subtle. Nolan had a bag full of crabs in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nolan, just because I said I wanted crabs, you didn't need to bring an entire bag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan's handsome face was warm, like a spring breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, there are four of us here. Whatever we don't finish now, we can have for a late-night snack. We'll be busy tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Diana perked up. "You're thoughtful as always. Exactly, a late-night </span><span>snack is essential. Before Christmas, we need to settle company matters. After dinner, let's strategize against Queenie and Andrew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Joseph. "Joseph, sit down and eat. You've worked hard today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph smiled and shook his head. Working here was exciting and fulfilling, and the best part was seeing Diana whenever he wanted. "Diana, it's not hard work! I really enjoy it. It makes me happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's smile revealed her charm. "I'm glad you're happy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group sat down to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven had been silently watching Diana from his office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worked with meticulous precision, and by the afternoon, she had already stabilized numerous business partners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was her design talent exceptional, but she was also remarkably skilled in business!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Alexander had gifted her three billion dollars' worth of jewelry to celebrate her divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had gone all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered and thought, "Alexander, you want to take what's mine? Dream on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan entered with dinner and a paternity test report in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, it's time for dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked up from his phone, his gaze falling on an unfamiliar face, which made him uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gestured at Evan's face mask. "Take off that mask. I can't eat while looking at a stranger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed the dinner on the table and handed Steven the paternity test results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, do you want to look at this first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced indifferently at the folder, not in any hurry. "Leave it there. I'll look at it after dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan froze, thinking, "Isn't he anxious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan himself was incredibly impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed the folder to the side and sat down, visibly upset. Earlier, he had witnessed something that left him deeply unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Evan's mood, Steven asked, "What's wrong? Why the sour face? You were only out to get food."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan looked at him and said in a low voice, "When I went to meet the chairman, I saw Edison with him. He is investigating your personal affairs. It turns out he's also working for the chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, he's been betraying you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven wasn't surprised, as though he had long known of his betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was shocked by Steven's lack of reaction. "Mr. Gellar, aren't you upset?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven handed Evan the cutlery before saying, "I've known about his disloyalty for a while. That's why he's only ever handled peripheral tasks. The only people I trust in the company are you, Dalton, and Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was frustrated, staring at Steven's inscrutable face. "Mr. Gellar, Diana hates you so much. Why do you trust her and give her everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a bite of food before replying, "It's simple. Deep down, Diana has feelings for me. When George appeared, she immediately recognized the difference between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She realized it was George who truly hurt her, which lessened her hatred for me. Out of her devotion to Grandma, she will fight to protect the Gellar Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I lived with her for two years. I understand her character well. She's incredibly kind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was exasperated. "Mr. Gellar, you're taking advantage of Diana's kindness! You know she won't retaliate against you, so you exploit her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled, "You could say that. But Evan, apart from Grandpa and Grandma, Diana is the only person who's ever shown me favoritism. I can't let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she's also stubborn. Once she makes up her mind, she won't change it unless a miracle happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a miracle had indeed occurred. Another man, George, who looked exactly like Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan, she's amazing. I don't deserve her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned by Steven's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this the same Steven he knew?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, now that you've realized your mistakes, Diana will forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave a bitter smile. "She won't. Even if she forgives me, she'll never take me back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what I do, the damage I've caused can't be undone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the time, I don't even know what I was thinking. I knew Andrew was targeting Diana but still treated her poorly. Even when I knew Queenie was in the wrong, I refused to help Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew Queenie approached me with ulterior motives, but I still treated her well because of a misguided sense of gratitude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that's why Diana would never forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might look back, but she'd never turn back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she wanted now was to move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan felt even more dejected. "Mr. Gellar, you just need to try harder. Back then, you were afraid she'd get hurt. Diana is smart. She'll understand your reasons. She worked so hard to take care of you when you were blind and unable to walk. You didn't let anyone else care for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You only let her get close to you. She has always taken good care of you. Mr. Gellar, you have feelings for Diana, but you hurt her because you feared she'd suffer more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took another bite of rice. The food was delicious, but he missed the food made by Diana. It was incomparable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Evan on the verge of tears, Steven felt a pang of guilt. "What you said is true. I had feelings for her then, and that's why I kept her close. But Evan, I realized it too late. Do you understand?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="925.html">« Prev</a><a href="927.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
