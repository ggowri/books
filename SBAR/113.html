Bitch, you are not worthy of Steven. Hurry up and get a divorce.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then there were a lot of photos on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The people were him and Queenie. Steven was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The people in each picture were very close, showing him hugging Queenie tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven gazed at Queenie with deep affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was filled with anger. Queenie's words became more and more outrageous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Diana, do you think you can rest easy just because you are the daughter of the Marsh family? One day, I will make everyone around you despise you. Even your four brothers will hate you and pamper me forever.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[I will take away all the people and things you care about.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Diana, you will never be happy to take my man away. How does it feel to be framed by me today? Are you sad that Steven beat you? You are helpless. Will anyone believe you if you tell them?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven tightly held the phone. He didn't know that Diana had experienced all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quickly sent him the photos via text message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Photo sending failed. Diana blocked his contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He read it for a long time, until he couldn't bear it anymore. Steven stopped and looked at Diana. "Diana, these are not the facts. Do you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed angrily and mocked him, "Steven, you are joking. If you didn't love her so deeply, why would you let Queenie do whatever she wants and trust her in everything?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, you came to me today because your mother was poisoned. I guess the evidence should have been given to you by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You finally chose to believe her and came to question me. How could I refute it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You would rather believe your childhood sweetheart, who abandoned you when your legs were injured and your eyes were blind, than believe me, your wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, when you know the truth one day, everything you did to your mother will make you feel miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, Queenie has been insulting me in this way for years. No matter how close you are, I don't want to see it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tell her not to send me messages and photos like this anymore. I have screenshotted and saved them all. If she sends these to me again, I will make them public."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was very annoyed. He tugged at his tie, and his look became more serious. Diana didn't believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had no idea that Queenie was so shameless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie photoshopped Steven and her together and sent the picture to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His voice was hoarse. "I just come to you for confirmation. I will try to believe you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana said, "No, what did you say? Try to believe me? That's unnecessary. From the day I left, I no longer need your trust. I don't love you anymore. I don't care anymore. You have nothing to do with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana stood up, looked at the chef and said, "Please send my breakfast to my room. I don't want to eat here. I don't want mustard. I am slightly allergic to mustard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And don't cook too much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The chef smiled and said, "Okay, Ms. Bishop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana stood up and left without caring about Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sat there quietly and did not disturb Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Olivia had breakfast in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Olivia, tell me, when can I get a divorce?" Diana looked at Olivia and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia looked at Diana. "You two are destined to be together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You told me before that Alexander and I were destined to be together. Why did you change your words?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia was also curious. She thought about it and looked at Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was right about what she said,but now that had changed.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="112.html">« Prev</a><a href="114.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
