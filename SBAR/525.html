She was a Barnes, her parents' only child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula couldn't let this pack of ungrateful scoundrels drive her parents to their graves. So, for the sake of her parents, she was willing to abandon even her own son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric felt a deep sadness wash over him. He thought, "Is this what Mom really believes? Is it because I'm Jeff's son? Is that why she chose to give me up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric cried as he asked, "Mom, can't you just give me a chance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Eric. You're old enough now to make your own decisions. You don't need to ask me for anything. Whatever happens, talk it over with Queenie and Jeff. You're the ones who are a family." The more Paula spoke, the more her heart ached. This massive conspiracy had exhausted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Paula made one last request. "Eric, if you don't want something terrible to happen to my parents and me, keep what you said tonight to yourself. Don't let Queenie find out that I know about Jeff and his mistress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's grip on the phone weakened, his hand falling limp. His mother had truly given up on him. It was a long time before he choked out a reply, "Mom, I'll change. I'll do whatever it takes to make you proud. I'll become the son you deserve. I'll stay close to them, and if I hear anything, you'll be the first to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula didn't respond. She just hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda frowned at her. "Paula, I told you before. Eric still has his head on straight. He could've helped you manage the company. Why did you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smiled bitterly, "Linda, you don't understand. He's always done things on a whim, never showing maturity or stability. If I let him come back now, he'll think everything is too easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he's finally had a wake-up call, let him stay with Queenie. He can learn a thing or two from her and Steven. It might help him grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bringing him back now would only lead to his downfall. Diana has already saved Frank, and with her kind heart, she won't just abandon her brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Dylan, he's stubborn to the bone. I might be able to pull Eric and Gale back, but him... I fear he's beyond saving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula stood up, her smile filled with sorrow. "Linda, I've been so foolish. Women are far too easy to get lost in a man's sweet words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda frowned, her heart aching for her. "Paula, aside from being deceived in marriage, you've been incredibly successful in your career. Life is full of hardships. Let the past go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was impossible to truly forget, they had no choice but to keep moving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's eyes turned cold. "Linda, let's not linger on the past. Once Queenie transfers the two hundred million dollars, sell the company to yesterday's buyer. It's just an empty shell, but we'll still get five hundred million. That'll be Diana's wedding gift someday. Even if she never sees me as her mother again, she's still a good daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula closed her eyes in pain. This was all she could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda pressed her lips and remained silent. Her heart ached as she watched Paula suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie had already made arrangements for the Farley family late into the night. She stood by the window, watching the snowfall. Her gaze was cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had already gotten what she wanted from Westwood. Cecil couldn't be kept around anymore. He was only in her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil had chosen the wrong side, siding with Diana, and now he'd pushed himself to a dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie relished pulling off something earth-shattering while her opponent remained blissfully unaware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing there for a long while, Queenie finally called Mario.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh." Mario greeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Steven?" Queenie asked. "Where is he right now?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="524.html">« Prev</a><a href="526.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
