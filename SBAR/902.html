So what happened? After just one year, have you completely forgotten him? How dare you still talk about love?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven is nothing but a scumbag. He&#x27;s been with you and still has the nerve to humiliate me. Haven&#x27;t you always wanted to take my place? Well, I&#x27;ve let him go. So why are you still running around looking for pain?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie. I&#x27;ve told you time and again not to mess with me and definitely not to flaunt yourself in front of me. You&#x27;re disgusting. And what I&#x27;ve got for you will always be more than you can handle.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana didn&#x27;t care about any of this. She was just watching them tear each other apart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie felt humiliated every time she faced Diana. The woman&#x27;s words always seemed to pierce her soul.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She sneered bitterly. &quot;Diana, I know you&#x27;re pretending not to care, but deep down, you&#x27;re hurting, aren&#x27;t you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana interrupted her again, voice ice-cold. &quot;Queenie, if thinking that way helps you feel better, go right ahead.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Just get lost,&quot; Diana snapped, disgust written all over her face. &quot;You make me sick.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t stand her at all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s hands balled into fists, furious. She couldn&#x27;t argue with Diana&#x27;s words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her eyes narrowed as she glared at Diana. &quot;Diana, Steven and I are getting married soon. I&#x27;m going to make sure he gives me the most spectacular wedding the world&#x27;s ever seen. You can come watch, and see how happy I am.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">For a split second, Diana felt a sharp pang in her chest. It was a reflex, something that came from deep within.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she had already let go of him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Fine, if you&#x27;re inviting me, I&#x27;ll bring our marriage certificate and let everyone see what a grand wedding you&#x27;re having with you as the mistress.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smiled brightly at her. &quot;Diana, tomorrow at 9 AM, you and Steven should go to the Courthouse and get your divorce.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sure, I can&#x27;t wait for it. But...&quot; Diana said with a cold smile, not continuing her sentence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie didn&#x27;t quite catch her meaning and walked off arrogantly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana had already planned to divorce, so she wasn&#x27;t upset at all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She shifted slightly, looking out the window. With Christmas approaching, the sounds of children playing outside filled the air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Their laughter made her feel light and happy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After the divorce, there would be no more ties between her and Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, I&#x27;m back!&quot; Olivia called out as she brought breakfast upstairs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She paused, noticing the door was open. &quot;Hey, why is the door open?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s nothing. Queenie came by earlier to remind me that I should go with Steven to get a divorce tomorrow morning. Honestly, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been wanting for a while. Olivia, could you take me to the Courthouse tomorrow?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia was a bit taken aback. She hadn&#x27;t expected Steven to suddenly agree to the divorce. Her calculations on Diana&#x27;s love life hadn&#x27;t suggested this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She nodded. &quot;Of course. You focus on getting better. I&#x27;ll take you tomorrow. You&#x27;ve wanted to break free from Steven for so long. If staying with him isn&#x27;t making you happy, then it&#x27;s time to move on. Don&#x27;t force yourself into something that doesn&#x27;t work for you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana had known this truth for a long time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Okay!&quot; She smiled brightly, and it was like the whole room lit up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alright, alright. I&#x27;ll listen to you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked genuinely happy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia couldn&#x27;t help but feel a little sad watching her. &quot;You&#x27;ve been through so much. But there&#x27;s still a lot ahead for you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She furrowed her brow slightly, unsure if it was because she herself was getting worn out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the happiest thing was seeing Diana break free from such a painful relationship and go back to the things she loved.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana quickly opened the takeout and took a bite. She was starving.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she still couldn&#x27;t figure out why she&#x27;d slept for three whole days.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Olivia, do you think I&#x27;ve been cursed or something?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With Olivia, she didn&#x27;t need to hold back, knowing she would understand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia shook her head. &quot;With me around, how could you be cursed?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana tilted her head, deep in thought. &quot;Do you think it&#x27;s because the impact was so intense that I ended up sleeping for three days?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia immediately understood and laughed. &quot;Silly, you didn&#x27;t get cursed. You just slept too much because the hit was too strong.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She pointed to the breakfast. &quot;Enough of that. Eat! Didn&#x27;t you say you&#x27;re starving?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yeah! I haven&#x27;t eaten in three days.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana quickly drank the milk, feeling much better.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She grabbed a burger and took a big bite.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mmm... this smells so good.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia snatched the burger out of her hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You can&#x27;t eat this right now. Your stomach&#x27;s been resting for three days. Better not risk it. We&#x27;ll have something good tonight.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana glared at her, still eyeing the burger. &quot;So, the burger&#x27;s really for you, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia grinned. &quot;Well, of course.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana really wanted it, and she felt confident her stomach could handle it now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia noticed the longing in her eyes and quickly changed the subject. &quot;Alright, I&#x27;ll get you a burger tonight. Don&#x27;t pout. I&#x27;ve been working non-stop abroad, but I came back just to spend Christmas with you. And I didn&#x27;t even take any money for it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was deeply touched. &quot;Aww, you&#x27;re the best. After the divorce tomorrow, I&#x27;ll be completely free.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was really happening. The events were lining up exactly like they did in her previous life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In just over a year, Steven would be killed by Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And Queenie would rise to the top of the wealth charts, becoming the envy of everyone. Diana just needed to subtly trip her up and wait for the right moment to strike.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took a deep breath. This time, she was living for herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia finished her burger and then said, &quot;Diana, I&#x27;m getting this strange feeling that something&#x27;s off.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at her, confused. &quot;What do you mean? Something&#x27;s off?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="901.html">« Prev</a><a href="903.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
