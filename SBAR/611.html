"It's only been twenty days, but you've paid off all your debts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Someone offered a high price for all my father's property, so I paid off all my debts. I don't have a job now, and I plan to take a break for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff really never expected Paula to have paid off her debts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he came back to his senses, she had already entered Diana's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to follow but paused.

She sat on the carpet, staring out the window in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snowflakes were falling from the sky. Her eyes were unfocused and empty, and her heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was brought back to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up slowly, glanced at the door, and said, "Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna walked in. She was speechless, but Paula begged her, eager to meet Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Diana, Ms. Barnes wants to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that she meant Paula.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she here for money, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was very annoyed. Since Paula was here, she might as well meet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was slightly hoarse. "Let her in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Paula came in with a thermos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked around Diana's office, which was spacious and bright. It was very nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "Diana, are you busy now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pointed to the sofa opposite and gestured for her to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, this is the clam chowder I cooked. It's cold. Eat some to warm yourself up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "Ms. Barnes, your ex-husband just came here, and I didn't give him money. Are you here to ask for money in another way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I'm still the same Diana before, who will obediently do anything for you after you give me some candy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was furious. "Did Jeff ask you for money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said in an icy voice, "Yes. You came just after he left. I owe you nothing more, and I have paid for my living at the Marsh Villa for a year. Please don't disturb me again in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never allow these people to hurt her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I wanted the clam chowder before, wishing that my mother would make me a dinner to my liking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you never did it for me. Since we have severed our relationship, I hope we won't meet again. Even if we run into each other, let's pretend to be strangers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula sobbed, "Diana, that's not the case. You misunderstand me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="610.html">« Prev</a><a href="612.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
