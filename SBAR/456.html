"Miss, I really don't think so. I've checked it several times, and she genuinely grew up in that little village. There's no record of her traveling abroad, and her background is pretty straightforward. She didn't even finish high school before marrying Steven</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've gone over this three times, carefully. I'm sure there's no mistake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie frowned, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still felt something off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think those guys would hand her 50 million just like that, without any reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was baffled. Diana didn't seem like someone who could pull that off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized she had seriously underestimated Diana. First, she turned out to be a designer, and now she was splashing cash on real estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario didn't respond right away. "Miss, we've been filming on the island lately. I'll dig into it more once we get back. Maybe she's just buying the land for someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That thought seemed to spark something in Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be for Nolan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario nodded. "It's possible. Azure Group's daughter is in real estate. Everyone knows that Nolan is just the front man. The real power lies with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt a wave of relief wash over her. The idea of Diana being more successful than her was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at Mario, managing a small smile. "</span><span>C</span><span>heck into this carefully. I'm worried Diana is slipping out of our control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, her phone buzzed. It was Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She motioned for Mario to step out while she answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, how are you settling into island life? Getting used to the food?" Paula's voice was warm and cheerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm loving it! The food's actually pretty good. Thanks for checking in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good to hear! I called because Jane embezzled two billion from us, which nearly tanked our company. But we've sorted it out. I sent her to prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reported her to the police. If she doesn't pay it back, I'll file for recovery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our company was hanging by a thread because of her. We've been drained by that kind of leech! And she almost faced serious complications during childbirth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I even gave her four months of paid maternity leave and covered her mom's surgery costs. I helped her every step of the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is how she repays us? By stealing 200 million? What a low blow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe it! I was so upset when I found out! With the Azure Group pulling out, our company is about to crash, and that lowlife actually stole our money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's voice trembled with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's expression shifted as Paula spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned to hear Paula cursing as she was always kind. As for she had caught on to the embezzlement...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane would definitely spill the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it got out that Queenie had orchestrated it, she'd be finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would raise Paula's suspicions too. Even if they were short on cash now, their real estate was worth billions, and some of it was still in her parents' names.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="455.html">« Prev</a><a href="457.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
