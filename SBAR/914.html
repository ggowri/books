It's using Priya to keep him in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph was the kind of person who, with just a little incentive, would be fiercely loyal and willing to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Joseph had been snatched away by Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! If he won't do anything for me, why should I concern myself with him? That was just a condition I proposed, but he didn't accept. Now he's your pawn, so what's the point in discussing it?" Queenie fumed, struggling to understand why she had fallen behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. "Indeed, it's rather pointless. Priya&zwnj; is in good health now and will live a long life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph, hearing this, looked at Diana's profile and couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was furious, thinking, "No way! I can't let Joseph help Diana. I've done my homework on his capabilities. If he were to help Diana, it would cause a lot of trouble." She shot back. "Diana, you're only getting close to Joseph to use him. You rescued Priya&zwnj; just to exploit his skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Joseph, she added, "Joseph, don't let her fool you. She's a con artist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression darkened, and her eyes narrowed. Queenie was trying to sow discord, but it was too late for that now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, she replied, "Actually, I should thank you for introducing me to Joseph. That night when your people kidnapped Luna and hung her from a skyscraper, I rescued her and took her to the hospital. That's where I happened to meet Joseph. If it weren't for your well-planned little abduction, I might never have crossed paths with him. So, really, I owe you one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's fists clenched. She mused, "So that's how Diana met Joseph."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder he doesn't want to work with me. You've got him under your spell, Diana. You're shameless. He's still just a student!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She twisted their relationship, trying to distract from Diana's mention of the kidnapping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana found Queenie's antics laughable. "Queenie, when it comes to slinging mud, you truly excel. Anyone who interacts with a man gets dragged into your web of lies. So, tell me, do you have questionable relationships with all the men you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't!" Queenie shot back quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana continued, "Joseph and I have a professional relationship. He's the manager of the tech department at the Gellar Group. Can you really twist that into something else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Were you brain-dead when you left the house, or did they cut your brain out when you were born?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or is it that the heartless have the dirtiest minds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George watched the verbal sparring between Diana and Queenie, then turned to Queenie, his voice low but firm. "Enough of this nonsense. We have serious matters to discuss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gritted her teeth, forced to endure the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a furious glare at Joseph, who sat with a gloomy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, Queenie sent someone to cut off my grandmother's oxygen supply?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she's trying to tarnish Diana's name. I won't let her get away with this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can feel who truly cares for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's kindness is genuine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one truly trying to use me is Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's done her research and sought me out at the hospital to help, but her help feels like charity&mdash;a never-ending demand for my skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recognized the urgency of the situation. She placed all the documents on the table, saying with her voice steady and clear, "Ladies and gentlemen, executives and shareholders, the company is now under my name. All of Steven's assets are in my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If any of you don't want to work with me, now is your chance to stand up and leave. I have no interest in hearing your excuses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The executives exchanged glances, and a mixture of confusion and concern spread across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent spoke up, "Ms. Bishop, even if you're in charge of the whole group, you can't just do this. We haven't even had a chance to speak, and are you already trying to kick us out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot him a cold glance. "Mr. Moore, you don't need to say anything. You're one of the people who should be leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? I haven't done anything wrong!" he protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, and her eyes narrowed as she turned to Joseph. "Vincent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph quickly pulled up Vincent's file and presented it to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued with steady voice, "Mr. Moore, you've been working here for two years, and you've accepted bribes from suppliers totaling 30 million dollars. Not to mention, you own a million-dollar property. I'll be reporting this to the authorities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's face turned ashen as shock and fear set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I thought they said Diana was a lightweight. I didn't need to worry about her. But here she is, targeting me right off the bat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, this is slander. I'm going to report you!" he shouted, and his anger boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gellar Group was a goldmine, and if Vincent left, he'd have nothing&mdash;and possibly face prison time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied coolly, "Go ahead. Call the police. They're already downstairs. I'll make sure to package up all the evidence for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's eyes widened in horror, and his face went pale. He fell silent, realizing he had just walked into Diana's trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't give anyone a chance to speak. "Next up, Mr. Collins. You've been bullying company staff and using your position to exploit female employees. I'm charging you with rape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, who had been sitting up straight, suddenly slumped to the floor, and his face was a mask of terror. "It's over! It's all over!" he cried out with trembling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a stunned silence, the only sound being Charlize's panicked cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other executives kept their heads down, afraid to speak, fearful they might be next on the chopping block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was seething. George had placed all of them in power, and now Diana was systematically ousting them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, this is outrageous!" George exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned sharply to George. "Mr. Gellar, the company is mine now. I call the shots. Who do you think you are to meddle in my affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George stammered, "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana snapped, "Shut up. Just look at how you've managed this company. These people are all leeches, bloodsuckers, and are you willing to keep a rapist on board? You're just as rotten as they are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just four minutes, Diana had removed six executives from their positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already arranged for Nolan to find replacements for all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her swift and ruthless actions left everyone in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana scanned the dumbfounded shareholders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are twelve of you here, holding about 35 percent of the shares combined. I hold 51 percent. The remaining shares are in the hands of Sir Foliot, who was busy acquiring shares last night, and some are with Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have the majority stake in the company. If any of you don't want to stay, I can buy back your shares at a high price. If you cause a scene, I'll dismantle my shares and cut all ties between your companies and the Gellar Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders were left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Diana, I'm an old shareholder, and I haven't even had a chance to speak yet. Do you think you can just kick us out?" Laird glared at Diana with gloomy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smirked. "If you want to leave, I can have my legal team come in right now and facilitate that. After all, you and Mr. Andrew Gellar are in the same boat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird's eyes narrowed as he pointed at Diana. "What... what do you mean by that?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="913.html">« Prev</a><a href="915.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
