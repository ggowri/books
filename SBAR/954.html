In her previous life, he and Queenie were inseparable, and everyone envied their bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she waited for Nick, Diana suddenly saw someone she really didn't want to face. It was Yanson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well! The cripple's all alone? Where's your pretty little sidekick?" Yanson smirked, looking down at her with a mocking grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot him a tired look. "Yanson, you really should learn some manners before you end up digging your own grave. I might be crippled, but I can still stand up. If your mouth gets twisted, though, you'll never be able to talk again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson's eyes flashed with malice. He shoved her wheelchair hard, sending it crashing into the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden impact slammed her back into the hard surface, her head banging against the wall. For a moment, everything went blurry, her head pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she looked at Yanson again, her eyes were cold, full of barely contained fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She yelled, "Barry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far off, Barry, who had been keeping a low profile to protect her, dashed out as soon as he saw what happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop." Barry's voice was icy, his gaze lethal as he stared down Yanson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson, however, didn't think much of Barry. Instead, he sneered at Diana. "So, Diana, looks like you've picked up another pretty boy. Your luck's unbelievable, each one more handsome than the last. This one, though, looks a bit more... manly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice was sharp and full of anger. "Barry, make him regret those words. Break his damn mouth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry nodded respectfully. "Yes, Ms. Bishop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson, infuriated, laughed bitterly. "You've been thrown out of the Marsh family, and even your mother doesn't want you. Stop acting like you're some high and mighty princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because you've got the Gellar Group doesn't mean you're special. Seriously, look at yourself. What a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Barry's fist landed hard against his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson, who had always been spoiled, had never experienced such a blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a painful scream and stumbled back, blood pouring from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cries drew attention from the crowd, who eagerly gathered to see the drama unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Yvette, who had been about to leave, noticed the commotion. George's sexual need was high, and though he typically went on for long stretches, tonight had been the exception, only a few minutes, but torturous in its way. She needed to rest now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reached the door, she spotted Yanson getting pummeled by Diana's people. Ignoring the crowd, she made her way over and stopped when she saw the blood dripping from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana!" she shouted, "Just because you think you're someone now, you can't go around bullying people! You're hitting someone in public! Do you have no shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at her, disgust curling her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow, her smile playful but wicked. "Ms. King, maybe it's time to go home and lie down. You're wobbling like you can't even stand. Sure, sex can be fun, but it's hard on the body, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette's eyes widened in shock. "Diana, what the hell are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I saying? Every private room has cameras, and I happened to be right next to yours. </span><span>Do you</span><span> think I didn't hear all that? Disgusting. I could barely eat with the noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your sounds were... truly revolting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's bluntness left Yvette frozen, her face turning pale as she realized the crowd was staring at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately regretted ever crossing paths with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't be ridiculous. Maybe you just misunderstood something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, a sly smile tugging at her lips. "Maybe. But if you're trying to defend him, then I heard what I said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat in her voice was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette shot a quick look at Yanson. She'd been hoping to back him up and maybe win a little favor, but now she was stuck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't realized there were cameras around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With </span><span>a glare</span><span>, she turned and stormed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Yanson, offering a cool, almost polite smile. "Mr. Hastings, looks like you'll be spending Christmas in a holding cell for attempted murder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson flinched, pain shooting through his body. His head was spinning. When he heard her words, it took him a moment to process what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced up to see her dialing her phone, ready to call the police. Only then did it hit him that he was the one who'd started all of this, the one who'd pushed her first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this got out, he'd be the one humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I was just messing with you! I was mad, so I kicked your wheelchair. How does that make it attempted murder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana calmly pointed at the wheelchair, now jammed against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the elevator door had opened and the wheels got stuck, do you not understand the consequences of that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can defend the Gellar family all you want, but you don't get to bully someone who's already vulnerable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson scoffed, sneering at her, "You're just an orphan. No one even wants you. So, what's with the attitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head, feeling pity for him. It was typical of someone like him to end up in Queenie's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who acted recklessly always ended up paying for their own mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look down on the poor, the average, the unwanted. You think you're above all that. But the way you carry yourself? It's pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You come from money, went to the best schools, probably even took etiquette lessons. You should be the epitome of grace and class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what do you do? You pick on someone like me, someone who's already been through enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's the 'noble family' you always talk about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's the so-called class? Your actions are embarrassing. You're making a joke of your own family's name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words cut like a knife, and Yanson was left reeling, his face flushed with humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their circle, all the rich kids liked to wear the mask of being refined and cultured, but everyone knew they were up to things behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, people turned a blind eye, but Diana had called them out in front of everyone, </span><span>and it left him red-faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, people started whispering and pointing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, you've always used your power to bully people weaker than you. If it weren't for your connection to Steven, you wouldn't even be standing here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man who'd once been a victim of Yanson's bullying stepped forward, his voice dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson shot a glare at the man who spoke. "Ethan, what's your problem? You want another lesson from me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="953.html">« Prev</a><a href="955.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
