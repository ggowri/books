"Steven, you shouldn't treat me like this. I saved your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned around, his gaze icy as he stared at her. He recalled that he had just mentioned this very thing a mere ten minutes ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied, his voice steady and unyielding, "Queenie, I've been more than generous with you. I've given you five million dollars every month. Do the math&mdash;how much have I given you over the years? Don't push your luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Steven turned away, not sparing her another glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refused to indulge Diana's grievances by allowing Queenie to thrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven planned to rattle Queenie's secret backers, showing them just how ineffectual she was, and goad them into coming out into the open to engage him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, seething with indignation, rushed after him, only to be intercepted by Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed a polite smile and said, "Ms. Marsh, Mr. Gellar has an important meeting. Please, stay here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan, you have no right to stop me! Move aside!" Queenie spat, her anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "How dare Steven reject me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I don't love him, he should still be willing to give everything for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he keeps this up, I'll just go after his biggest rival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been waiting for the right moment to hypnotize him. But he doesn't dine with me anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because I've been pregnant with another man's child doesn't mean I'm not desirable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this day and age, who really waits for someone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's the twenty-first century, and Steven still clings to those outdated values.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he turned out like this, raised by that old fossil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan, you go tell Steven that I'm furious about his attitude today. If he doesn't apologize, I will never forgive him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had used this tactic before, and it always worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with whatever kept him busy, he would come running to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, she could continue to torment Diana, who always looked so heartbroken and frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It brought her immense satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan couldn't help but feel speechless, thinking, "What kind of person has the audacity to say such things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be able to talk like this because Mr. Gellar spoiled her, but now that he doesn't love her anymore, she still dares to say this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's got some nerve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And after her recent miscarriage, doesn't she ever feel exhausted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to avoid further entanglement with Queenie, he reluctantly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, I'll pass your message along to Mr. Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan hurried off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of frustration welled in Queenie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, if you don't love me, I swear I'll ruin you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched as the doors of Steven's private elevator closed before she finally left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan stepped into the elevator and relayed her message to Steven. "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Marsh said that if you don't apologize, she won't forgive you for today's incident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, his tone icy. "Is she out of her mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan shook his head, bewildered. "How would I know if she's lost it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven fell silent as the elevator reached the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode out with purpose. Once in his office, he commanded, "Keep a close watch on Queenie's every move. She's bound to make a lot of moves soon. Her phone doesn't hold any valuable clues, but she must have another one. Felicity is our best lead right now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="832.html">« Prev</a><a href="834.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
