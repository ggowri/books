"Micah, haven't you always liked Catherine? You killed the master for her, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't! I saw Catherine as a sister because she's always been kind to me. If she died, I would avenge her. What do you mean she isn't dead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Micah gripped his sword, the blade stained with Lucy's blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha... Micah, you're really foolish. Catherine just stirred the pot a bit, deliberately framing your master, and you blindly believed her lies, killing the one who cherished you most," mocked Meredith, Lucy's senior fellow apprentice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Catherine had just arrived and froze at his words, her face draining of color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Micah glared at the fallen Lucy, disbelief etched across his face. "Meredith, you and Lucy are the same. You've always harmed me and Catherine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meredith smirked wickedly, adding, "I set you up and let Lucy rescue you, then used her for your heart's blood, all without telling her the truth. I let Catherine frame Lucy just to reach this moment. You'll hate Lucy so much that you'll gladly plunge your sword into her, and then she'll die willingly at your hand. Hahaha..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meredith laughed happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the truth unfolded, Diana could feel Micah's heart shatter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was too tragic&mdash;too similar to her past life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lucy, just like her, was foolish, prioritizing false familial bonds, leading to her own demise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Micah had lost it, fully descending into madness and chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ugh..." Diana sobbed, her cries choking with grief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven watched her from the side, a storm brewing in his heart. He felt as foolish as the Micah from the movie, realizing too late that it was all irreparable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next to Diana sat a handsome young man, who observed her distress with concern. He politely offered her a tissue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss, please don't cry. What a clich&eacute; plot! The male lead is such an idiot, blind to the clear betrayal of the female antagonist. It's no wonder he's gone mad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana managed a smile through her tears. "Thank you! I just feel a lot like the heroine in this film. I have a idiot husband too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But really, thank you. Talking to you makes me feel much better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven could only watch in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she really out here calling him an idiot?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to the beautiful boy beside her, his youthful energy brightening the atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tear-filled eyes sparkled like stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss, you're so beautiful. Is your husband blind?" the young man remarked with a grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha!" That comment completely broke the tension, lifting Diana's spirits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe! I'll treat you to some popcorn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their voices were low.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sounds great! You look so young," the young man replied cheerfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm twenty-three, so I'm still young." Diana smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young man beamed even brighter. "We're the same age! You got married so young? But even if you're married, you can still have fun. Let's exchange numbers. Maybe we're meant to connect."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="430.html">« Prev</a><a href="432.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
