Someone who wanted to hurt her would always find a chance to set her up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don</span><span>'</span><span>t say that too soon," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t trust him, but he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t explain. He simply said, "Diana, let</span><span>'</span><span>s go home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Alright! I</span><span>'</span><span>m starving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven grabbed her hand and quickly led her out of the hospital doors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was already waiting at the entrance. Once they got in the car, he drove straight home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back home, Evan followed them inside. Diana knew he was going to see Luna.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as they walked in, Evan cautiously asked, "Mrs. Gellar, may I take Luna out on a date tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cautious demeanor surprised Diana. "You two are moving that fast?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan gave a shy laugh, scratching his head as his face turned red. "Mrs. Gellar, you know Luna and I have been through life and death together. She</span><span>'</span><span>s already agreed to be with me. Mrs. Gellar, today</span><span>'</span><span>s a great day. You have to congratulate me&mdash;I</span><span>'</span><span>m thirty, and I finally have a girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan grinned, absolutely beaming with joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and patted his shoulder. "Evan, I believe you, and congratulations. I know you truly care about Luna. But let me make one thing clear&mdash;if you ever hurt her, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll have me to answer to," Diana warned him sternly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan glanced at Steven. He wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t cold and detached like Steven. He was just an ordinary guy, wanting an ordinary life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he knew exactly what he wanted. After working for Steven for so many years, he had seen all kinds of women, especially in their messy, chaotic circle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would only ever love Luna. No other woman could compare to her. All he knew was, if he lost Luna, he</span><span>'</span><span>d never be happy for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Mrs. Gellar, I won</span><span>'</span><span>t make you any promises. Vows fade, but time will prove my love." His smile was gentle yet confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana trusted Evan</span><span>'</span><span>s character, of course. In the last life, he had stood by Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s side until the very end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I might not trust others, but I trust you. Now, take Luna out on your date, and stay safe," Diana said firmly. Then she added, "Evan, never leave the woman you love in an unfamiliar place, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan nodded with a smile. "Got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked up and saw Luna standing not far away, her face filled with emotion as she watched them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave her a small smile. "Luna, go on. Congratulations on being together, and I wish you both happiness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears shimmered in Luna's eyes. "Thank you, Diana. Evan and I will definitely be happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna ran toward Evan with a smile. He caught her and spun her around, his eyes full of love. Then, he took her hand and they walked away together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled as she watched them leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you trust Evan but not me?" Steven looked at her intently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's smile faded. She shot him a glare. "You're not like Evan. You learned your lesson, but he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t. He stayed loyal to you, Steven. When everyone else gave up on you, he was still there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew Evan's loyalty. He gently squeezed her hand, his voice soft with pleading. "Diana, you could try trusting me too. Just give me one more chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "On the island, I already promised to give you a chance. I also said it would be the last one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned at her, then couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but laugh. "That</span><span>'</span><span>s not what you said back then. You said everything depends on fate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana could never remember much when she was happy. She glanced at Steven. "Did I really say that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly shook his head. "No, you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t. You said you</span><span>'</span><span>d give me another chance. No take-backs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since she forgot, he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t going to remind her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a sly smile before catching the scent of roasted chicken. She quickly headed to the dining table.</span><span> </span><br><span>Seeing Luna had prepared a feast, she grinned, went to wash her hands, and got ready for dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven went to wash his hands too. When he came back, Diana was already eating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She usually ate very little at night, but tonight she was truly hungry, so she ate a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two ate dinner in silence. After finishing half the roasted chicken, Diana contentedly patted her stomach.</span><span> </span><br><span>"I'm finally full," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her satisfied smile and said, "Diana, Sandra works for Queenie. Part of George's assets were handled by Sandra. She's the legal representative of Queen Group, and now I've confirmed that this company belongs to Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew it hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t been easy for him to uncover this. Queenie had always been very good at keeping things hidden.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes. "Then we</span><span>'</span><span>ll destroy her company. She</span><span>'</span><span>s inherently vicious and will never change."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Owen might come to his senses, but Queenie never will. Both of us remember some things from our past lives. She remembers her moments of glory and how she climbed to the top."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, without your support, George's, or the Farley family, I</span><span>'</span><span>m not sure who she</span><span>'</span><span>ll turn to next."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who could it be? In our last life, after you died, Alexander became the richest man in Capitole. I only know he</span><span>'</span><span>s destined to get better and better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Funny enough, Grandpa took me to meet him for a matchmaking dinner, and I recognized him instantly. Besides you guys, I have no idea who else she could cling to."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned, troubled. What had she overlooked in their past life?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her like he</span><span>'</span><span>d just heard something unbelievable. "So, you met Alexander just because he</span><span>'</span><span>s going to be Capitole</span><span>'</span><span>s richest man in the future?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Exactly. Having someone powerful on my side is always useful. Getting his help is definitely a big advantage for my revenge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But..." Diana murmured, lost in thought. Something just didn</span><span>'</span><span>t feel right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her. "But what?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him, raising an eyebrow slightly. "But I feel like I</span><span>'</span><span>m missing something important, though I can</span><span>'</span><span>t quite figure out what it is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took her hand and said, "Then stop thinking about it. You</span><span>'</span><span>re tired today. Let me take you upstairs to rest."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1111.html">« Prev</a><a href="1113.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
