Not far away, Cecil burst into laughter, unable to hold it back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, this is just the beginning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, he would torment Queenie every day, making her taste the feeling of living hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well! Isn't this Ms. Marsh? How come you're such a weakling? You can't even walk straight without falling flat on your face."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's taunt came from above.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was in pain as she slowly got up. Seeing the water stain on the floor, her eyes turned cold. "You... did this, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh..." Cecil looked at her with a half-smile, neither confirming nor denying it. "Queenie, you tripped over yourself and now you want to blame me? You're so used to setting people up that you're even trying it on me?" Though he was responsible, he chose to deny it, just as she would.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stared at his mischievous expression, a hint of anger flashing in her eyes. Did he know about what happened abroad?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luckily, she had succeeded, and the project had been snatched away by her team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Farley, what are you talking about? I don't understand. I stepped on something and fell. You know very well whether you did it or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie endured the pain, maintaining the pitiful look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew exactly what a man's weakness was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The weak always garnered the most sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil stood lazily, but his sharp gaze was relentless. "With someone as vicious as you, how come you didn't break your neck from the fall?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Queenie glared at him. "Mr. Farley, how can you speak so rudely? What about your manners?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil sneered. "Do you think you deserve my manners? Queenie, have you forgotten how you schemed against my grandmother? From now on, get ready for my 'kindness.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he seemed to remember something. "Oh! Now I recall. The way you saved Mr. Foliot's grandson this time was exactly how you saved my grandmother last time. It's a handy trick. You even earned my admiration and got a collaboration offer as a thanks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's more, I heard that Mr. Foliot, being vain and proud, has spoiled you and even promised you the lead role in a movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When this movie is released, with all your scandals, let's see if it can even make it to the screen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as Cecil was around, he would never let her movie be released.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sneered. "Mr. Farley, be careful what you say and do. Whether you'll make it to that day depends on fate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's smile was eerie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil caught the hidden meaning, realizing that everything Diana had said was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He watched Queenie's retreating figure and took out his slingshot with a water bead inside. He aimed at her head, and released it forcefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bang..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie let out a shriek of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha..." Cecil burst into joyful laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie turned around, her eyes blazing with hatred as she glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would always find a chance to drag Cecil down to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With today's project signed and her scheme against his father a success, she let him vent his anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie turned and saw Steven walking in, immediately switching to a fragile demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dressed in a white dress, Queenie had fallen, and the dress was stained. Paired with her pitiful expression, she indeed looked quite miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I don't know how I offended Mr. Farley, but he hit me with a slingshot. My hair is all wet," Queenie complained, her tone filled with grievance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie looked at Cecil with resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil crossed his arms, smirking as he glanced at Steven's enigmatic face. "What's this? Is Mr. Gellar standing up for his mistress?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="243.html">« Prev</a><a href="245.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
