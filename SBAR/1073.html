I know many </span><span>outstanding men</span><span>. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll help you pick a better one next time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius held her hand and walked inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Julius, already playing matchmaker?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just don</span><span>'</span><span>t want you to pick another loser. </span><span>This n</span><span>ew guy's gotta pass the family test," Julius said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I'll definitely let you </span><span>vet</span><span> my man."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them chatted as they walked into the private room</span><span>. They </span><span>completely ignor</span><span>ed</span><span> the three people behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George stared gloomily at Diana's back. Only then did it hit him&mdash;he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t Steven. Why was he so mad about Diana ignoring him like that? Why did it bother him so much? He</span><span>'</span><span>d forgotten he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Dylan both looked uneasy. They hadn't expected Diana to have such a handsome brother.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this month and a half, Dylan had been scheming to kick Diana out of her CEO position at the Gellar Group&mdash;but he hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t even been able to get a meeting with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The private room they booked was right next to Diana's. After sitting down, they could still hear Diana talking with others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at George. In front of Dylan, she addressed him as Steven. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, it's Diana's birthday today. You should go </span><span>say hi</span><span>. I'll go with you. I </span><span>brought</span><span> a bracelet. You can give it to her as a gift."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George replied, "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Tobias and Leopold also arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George walked in with Queenie</span><span>.</span><span> The moment Diana saw them, her smile disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing them, the real Steven sitting next to Diana had murder in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said coldly, "Today is my birthday. Please don't ruin my good mood."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing how defensive she became the moment she </span><span>saw</span><span> him, George was angry. "Diana, </span><span>it</span><span> is your birthday. I came to give you a birthday gift."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias smiled</span><span>.</span><span> "Mr. Gellar, not just any gift is welcome here. And you think what you brought is actually worth something?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George knew Diana liked jewelry, and her favorite was rubies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is a ruby bracelet chosen by Queenie. You'll definitely like it." </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying this, George handed over the gift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The expressions of the men present all changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't reach out to take </span><span>i</span><span>t. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, you don't need to give me a gift. You and I are strangers. Why should I accept </span><span>i</span><span>t?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias sneered coldly and said, "Mr. Gellar, your taste is awful. That design</span><span>'</span><span>s so dated, even your mother wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t wear it. If you</span><span>'</span><span>re gonna give a gift, at least put some thought into it. This? This is embarrassing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's face immediately </span><span>darkened</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was very angry</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's Diana </span><span style="font-style: italic;">playing at</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said angrily, "Diana, this bracelet is worth at least two hundred thousand dollars. How </span><span>could</span><span> you look down on such an expensive bracelet? It's already generous of him to give it to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And who are these people? If they think that gift</span><span>'</span><span>s not good enough, I</span><span>'</span><span>d love to see what they brought."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias smiled and said, "Diana, I didn't </span><span>make</span><span> much last year, but I still </span><span>bought you something</span><span>. This is a street I bought last year, worth one billion dollars</span><span>. It's yours now. Happy birthday.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he handed a document to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said in shock, "Tobias, your gifts get more expensive every year. What am I supposed to give you for your birthday now? Two billion?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You silly girl. Every year, you just cook me some pasta</span><span>.</span><span>" Tobias said with an amused laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smirked</span><span>.</span><span> "One pasta for a billion dollars. </span><span>Good bargain</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Dylan were both stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius smiled</span><span>. </span><span>"Diana, I know you love racing. I bought all the top 20 luxury cars in the world for you. All the keys are here. You can pick a different one to drive every day."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana swallowed hard. "Julius, I was just </span><span>kidding</span><span>. Did you really buy them all?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>It's what you wanted for your birthday</span><span>. Of course, I </span><span>would buy</span><span> them for you. It didn't cost me much. Don't worry about it. When my birthday</span><span> comes</span><span>, just make me some spaghetti with tomato sauce."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh my God! Thank you, Julius." Diana's eyes turned red because she was so happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I was so foolish in my past life. I had brothers like these, but I still chose to stick around the Marsh boys. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My brothers are the ones who truly love me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius continued, "Hubery couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t make it, but he still sent a gift.</span><span> </span><span>He asked me to give it to you&mdash;a skyscraper worth three billion dollars. He loves you the most, so of course he gave you the biggest gift. It</span><span>'</span><span>s already in your name. You can go check it out tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They give me</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> such expensive gifts every year. It</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s kind of overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said happily, "Hubery</span><span>'</span><span>s the best. Julius, we have to go pick him up sometime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius smiled and nodded</span><span>.</span><span> "Alright. If you go, he will definitely come back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Diana was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she looked at Leopold. "Grandpa, what are you going to give me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold sneered</span><span>.</span><span> "Now you remember me, huh? Just &lsquo;cause you want a gift."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I haven't seen Julius in so long</span><span>.</span><span> I got too excited."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I already gave you most of my fortune. Let me think about what else I can give you," Leopold </span><span>looked</span><span> a bit troubled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, he became very excited. "</span><span>Ah.</span><span> I still have ten billion dollars sitting in offshore accounts. Those stingy boys gave you nothing compared to that. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll move the money to your name. This way, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll never have to worry about your future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was utterly shocked because this year's birthday banquet was somewhat unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Their gifts are too valuable. They're too generous</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven squinted his eye</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This old man is </span><span>really something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a bit troubled. "Grandpa, you give me money every year. Can't you give me something different this year?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Switch it to what?</span><span>"</span><span> Leopold said. </span><span>"</span><span>Remember this, Diana&mdash;money</span><span>'</span><span>s the only thing that</span><span>'</span><span>ll never betray you. Rely on a mountain, it</span><span>'</span><span>ll crumble. Rely on a man, he</span><span>'</span><span>ll run. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Even your three brothers will eventually get married, have kids. When they have families, they won</span><span>'</span><span>t be able to protect you like they do now. So I</span><span>'</span><span>d rather give you the money while I still can.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What will you do if </span><span>that happens</span><span> and they don't treat you well?" </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was stunned, while Queenie, George, and Dylan widened their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had seen wealthy people before, but never someone this rich.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George slightly tightened his grip on the gift box in his hand. Compared to their gifts, his was indeed </span><span>laughable</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Tobias didn't let him off. "Mr. Gellar, Diana doesn't need your gift</span><span>. She wears jewelry worth millions, sometimes tens of millions. A two-hundred-thousand-dollar bracelet? That's beneath her. You should give it to the lady next to you. It suits her</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's face </span><span>darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How did Diana end up </span><span style="font-style: italic;">in</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> such a wealthy family?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1072.html">« Prev</a><a href="1074.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
