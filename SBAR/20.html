Whenever I was wronged, you always chose to believe Queenie. If you&#x27;d ever shown any real care for me, your own daughter, I wouldn&#x27;t have broken ties with you so easily. But did you ever?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">These words left Paula feeling deeply upset. Whenever something happened to Queenie, she would simply claim that Diana had bullied her. Paula had raised Queenie, believing her to be thoughtful and sensible from a young age. She felt that Diana, who had only recently been found, couldn&#x27;t compare to Queenie. </p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula had given all her love to Queenie, but when her biological daughter was wronged, she never believed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The more Paula thought about it, the more upset she became.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Paula, Paula.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula suddenly came to her senses when she heard Jeff&#x27;s voice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; asked Paula, looking at him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff stood up and looked at her with pretended worry, his voice gentle and affectionate. &quot;Paula, have you been feeling unwell recently? Why do you always lose focus? How about I take you to the hospital tomorrow? Are you sick?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was stunned. She thought, &quot;Is it evident in my usual behavior?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s words make me dizzy.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Do I look uncomfortable?&quot; asked Paula with a frown.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff also frowned and continued, &quot;Yes. You seem to be sick. You can&#x27;t concentrate and occasionally stand there in a daze. Paula, you women have menopause. You should go see a doctor.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was speechless. She thought, &quot;He means that I have reached menopause.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Do you think I&#x27;ve reached menopause and should go to the hospital?&quot; Paula felt resentful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula suddenly thought of Diana&#x27;s words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana had once said, &quot;After a while, your tragic fate will officially begin, not only for you, but also for your four sons and your parents.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula thought, &quot;What kind of tragic fate does she mean?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She stood up and said to Jeff angrily, &quot;Jeff, don&#x27;t you know what I am worried about?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff narrowed his eyes, but he said nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;Could it be that she discovered something?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She didn&#x27;t notice it for so many years. Even though she has doubts now, they must have been dispelled.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jeff, do you know that the Azure Group has severed its cooperation with our company? Our company has not been doing well in the past two years. We have been unable to sign many cooperation agreements. I am getting anxious, and you actually said that I have reached menopause.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Seeing how anxious I am, as my husband, shouldn&#x27;t you get up early every morning to pray for me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He walked over to hug her and smiled, &quot;Okay, Paula, I will get up early tomorrow morning to pray for you. I have something to do tonight, so I will be back later.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula looked the same as usual. She nodded tiredly. &quot;Okay, go ahead. I need to rest early. I have to meet with the general manager of Azure Group tomorrow morning and try to meet with their president to discuss cooperation.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff knew about the Azure Group. The Azure Group had approached them for cooperation two years ago. He thought, &quot;Why does the cooperation suddenly end?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, Jeff didn&#x27;t think much about it. He thought, &quot;These things are normal in the business world. Maybe there is some misunderstanding, and everything will be fine once it is resolved. But these are none of my business. I just need to take the money and enjoy myself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff watched Paula go upstairs before going to the garage and driving away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula stood at the window on the second floor, watching Jeff&#x27;s car leave. She looked calm and sent a message.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Follow him and tell me about everyone he meets.]</p><div class="pagination"><a href="19.html">« Prev</a><a href="21.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
