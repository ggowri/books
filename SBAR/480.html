"Your arm is seriously injured. Why don't you stay in the hospital for treatment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised that Steven cared about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said mockingly, "Tsk, when I had a high fever before and couldn't even get up, I asked you to get me some medicine, but you thought I was a bother. Queenie called you, and you left. I almost died that time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I just broke the flesh on my arm, and you actually care about me. Don't be so fake, okay? I really can't get used to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew she had brought this on herself. She knew that Steven didn't love her, but she still wanted to be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated these people. They took advantage of her, but in the end, they became even more </span><span>shameless</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "When you took advantage of me to get the management rights, did you ever think about how much I was worth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So stop pretending to care. You only care about yourselves. Have you ever really cared about others?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana entered the villa after saying this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to see Steven at all. When she saw him, her heart&nbsp;was&nbsp;filled with&nbsp;anger and&nbsp;hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven strode over and stood in front of Diana. "Listen to me, Diana. I was wrong about what happened before. I knew the truth, and I won't treat you the same way as before. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana interrupted him coldly, "Shut up! I don't believe a word you say. Didn't you just leave me on the highway today? You still treat me the same way as before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven explained, "That's because you said you wanted to see another man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana snorted, "You can meet Queenie, so why can't I see other men? Steven, don't go too far. I've already given in, so please stay away from me. I really won't bother you anymore. You can stay with her or do whatever you like. I mean it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she couldn't bear to leave Steven. He saved her life. Apart from the affair with Queenie, he was really a good man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what bothered Diana the most was Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the four children of the Marsh family, the third and fourth sons were </span><span>useless</span><span>, so they died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared at Diana with his deep eyes. "I've said I'm serious this time. Diana, I don't deny your efforts, but I just don't know how to love someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana snorted coldly, "But you know how to love Queenie. You give her all your attention. Whenever she needs you, you can always be by her side. You don't want her to suffer a little. Even though she just got a scratch on her hand, you would feel heartbroken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the way you love her. Steven, why do you think you don't know how to love someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was angry, thinking Steven said that to mock her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was surprised, thinking, "Is this love? I have no feelings for Queenie, but Diana is different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Queenie, it's more like a responsibility, and I'm grateful for her saving my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the life-saving favor has almost run out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I treat Diana differently. She can easily affect my emotions. Seeing her with another man</span><span> makes me </span><span>want to kill</span><span> him</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "You're injured. I'll take care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he walked into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was angry, yelling, "Steven, this is my home. Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's tone was calm. "I know, but Grandma saw the news about your accident and asked me to take care of you. Otherwise, she will feel uneasy all night."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="479.html">« Prev</a><a href="481.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
