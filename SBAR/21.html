How could she be so bold as to push Rita?]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Diana is wicked.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[She is so awful. Madam Farley is almost 70 years old, and Diana actually pushed her into the swimming pool.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Hmph! I&#x27;ve seen Diana. She&#x27;s just a simp. All the Marsh family members hate her, including the four brothers. I can&#x27;t stand her timid and cautious demeanor. I didn&#x27;t expect that she would do such a terrible thing.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[When this kind of person explodes, it&#x27;ll be scary. Why would she want to harm an old man?]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[I heard that it was Queenie who jumped into the swimming pool to save Madam Farley. They are a family. Why are they so different?]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Yes. Queenie is gentle, kind, pretty, and elegant. She&#x27;s a talented pianist and a good dancer. She is excellent in everything. Why did the Marsh family adopt that useless Diana?]</p><p style="text-align:left;">The news was filled with insults directed at Diana, making her the target of public criticism.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, Queenie, who had planned the incident, felt excited and couldn&#x27;t sleep.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She intended to use Diana as her foil.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She would expose Diana for imitating her and even stealing her man, thus making everyone hate Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In less than half an hour, the news quickly gained traction on social media.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At this time, someone else surfaced another piece of news.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Word on the street is that Mr. Farley will hold a special thank-you party tomorrow night to express gratitude to Ms. Marsh for saving Madam Farley.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Mr. Farley is so great. I like his face. He&#x27;s so hot.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Wow! But it&#x27;s a shame that I can&#x27;t attend the party. I heard that only those with invitation letters can enter.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Don&#x27;t worry. It will be live-streamed. Just wait for the fun.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">At Olivia&#x27;s place, Diana and Olivia sat together, enjoying barbecue and beer while watching the online news and discussions.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana quirked and said, &quot;Is that all Queenie has got?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her previous life, Diana had been a hopeless romantic who was willing to endure Queenie&#x27;s bullying for the sake of a little family affection.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sadly, she didn&#x27;t feel any warmth from her family until her death.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone compared her with Queenie, and because she outshone Queenie, her four brothers became jealous of her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana cursed herself for being foolish in her previous life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">While enjoying their meal, Olivia frowned and stared at Diana. &quot;You&#x27;re just watching these people insult you and allowing Queenie to set you up behind your back?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia genuinely felt sorry for Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled mysteriously and replied, &quot;Olivia, let them be. Tomorrow, they will have eggs on their faces. Don&#x27;t worry. I have prepared for the party tomorrow night and won&#x27;t let myself be bullied. &quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="20.html">« Prev</a><a href="22.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
