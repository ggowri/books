Under the dim light, Steven looked unusually relaxed, with a hint of coldness in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled and said, "Diana, if I told you I was set up tonight too, would you believe me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing his familiar, mischievous smile, Diana was surprised. This side of Steven was rare.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's fists tightened instinctively as she eyed him warily. "Steven, you're in cahoots with Queenie and Mr. Foliot. Do you think I'd believe you?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't bother with sarcastic remarks. I couldn't care less how 'in love' you two are. Shameless as you are, you even matched your outfits. What a clever design. You three play your games well. Don't think you can be as slick in bed," Diana said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana turned and walked away, her back straight but icy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven let out a helpless laugh. Now, he could finally understand how Diana must have felt back then. They all believed Queenie but never her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So this was what it felt like to be disbelieved. It was truly hurt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart burned with frustration, but there was nowhere to vent it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fire in his chest raged uncontrollably, making him feel unbearable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wait, did Diana just say something about... the bedroom?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, what kind of person do you take me for?" Steven gritted his teeth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, are we going home or heading to the police station to bail someone out?" Evan asked as he ran over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was trying to see if the boss was finally over his "love-struck" mindset.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven asked him, "Did you find out anything?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan chuckled awkwardly. "Mr. Gellar, I was on the first floor watching the commotion. Paula caught Jeff cheating.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jeff slandered Ms. Bishop, so she called the police and got him arrested.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I heard Queenie screaming upstairs, so I followed the noise to see what was happening, and it looked like you were all in it together!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's brows furrowed. If Evan thought that, no wonder Diana didn't believe him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven growled, "I'm not in league with Queenie. Find out who drugged Cecil."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, is there any need to investigate? Of course, it's your childhood sweetheart, but there's no evidence. Mr. Foliot is helping her, making it hard to find proof," Evan replied.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan had seen everything clearly from outside earlier.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie loved to be the center of such chaos.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that Jace was protecting her, she'd make things as dramatic as possible. Even if people suspected her ulterior motives, they wouldn't intervene unless they were directly affected.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven pressed his lips together, watching Diana's distant figure as she hurried away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven instructed, "Go investigate, and call me once you find something."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he went after Diana.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="336.html">« Prev</a><a href="338.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
