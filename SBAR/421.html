His eyes were red with anger. "I just want you to go back. It's too late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is a society ruled by law. Even if it's too late, it's still safe out there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana left after that, without giving Steven any chance to speak again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at her departing figure and felt powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget it. Diana has always been strong. She'll figure it out herself," he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't understand how deeply the housekeeper's words had hurt Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned back and saw the housekeeper standing in the living room on the first floor. With a gloomy look, Steven said, "Go to Evan to get your paycheck. You are fired."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper froze, shocked and terrified. She cried and said, "Mr. Gellar, this is really not my fault. You said this before. I was afraid you and Ms. Marsh would be upset if I put Ms. Bishop on the second floor, so... so I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out!" Steven tugged at his tie in annoyance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had actually caused so much harm to Diana invisibly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was irritable now and didn't want to hear anyone's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper was shocked and quickly went back to her room to pack up. "Damn Diana, who the hell do you think you are? I was fired because of you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My daughter is still in college. Now that I've been fired, how can I afford her living expenses?" she wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper thought about it and planned to go to Queenie. Only Queenie could save her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she saw it clearly last time when Queenie pretended to be pushed down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper carried her belongings to the gate and called Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Marsh, I was fired by Mr. Gellar because I asked Diana to rest on the first floor. Ms. Marsh, I can tell you from my experience that Mr. Gellar has Diana in his heart. You should have a sense of crisis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sneered, "Steven can't possibly fall in love with Diana. Go back now and beg him to take you in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper was excited when she heard that. "Okay, okay, I'll go back and ask Mr. Gellar to take me in. Ms. Marsh, I'll keep an eye on Mrs. Helen Gellar and Mr. Gellar for you. You must get my son a job, preferably in the Gellar Group. My son and I can help you deal with Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie said, "Okay! I'll arrange it when I come back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The housekeeper turned back happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked out from the darkness and saw the housekeeper open the door and go in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was shocked to discover that the housekeeper here was actually Queenie's henchwoman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No wonder Queenie pretended to be pushed down the stairs last time, but the housekeeper came out and said that Queenie and I had an argument. The housekeeper added that she only saw me blaming Queenie but did not see me pushing her. The ambiguous answer made Steven certain that it was me who pushed Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looks like Queenie's got a lot of her people around Steven. For example, when we previously went diving on an uninhabited island, Queenie was able to pinpoint Steven's location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie seems to really care about Steven," Diana thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a look at the old residence, turned around and walked away slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she walked out of the villa area, she waited for Luna to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sat on the stone steps by the roadside, looking at the night view in the distance, feeling helpless. She hugged her knees with her hands and felt very upset. "Does my presence really make others so uncomfortable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why is all the evil directed at me?" Diana wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt the urge to cry again, so she looked up. Some people said that if you looked up, you wouldn't want to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She raised her head, but under the moonlight, crystal clear tears were still seen streaming down her face from the corners of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half of her face was in the shadow, and the other half was in the light, which made her look so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away, a photographer took a picture of her and captured that unique scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't go up to disturb her but left quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, chick, have you been bullied? Why are you sitting here crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Three men came out of a bar and walked up to Diana. The night was beautiful, and they were bold under the influence of alcohol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana saw the three drunkards and slowly stood up. She was already in a bad mood. These three people showed up at the right time so she could take it out on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the men approached Diana and reached out to grab her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Diana was about to make a move, a long leg stretched out from behind her, and the man was kicked away defenselessly.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="420.html">« Prev</a><a href="422.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
