These are all the proof of support from Ms. Barnes. And yet, when the company runs into trouble, not one of you lifts a finger to help. Instead, you come looking for </span><span>more </span><span>trouble</span><span>s</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric stared at the records, his anger boiling over as he stomped his foot. He had never seen a single cent of that money. The card in question was one he rarely used, always stashed away in a drawer at home because it had no balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly pulled out his phone and checked. It was indeed his card, but it had been sitting unused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden realization hit him. Three years ago, Queenie had asked to borrow his ID. He had trusted her completely, unaware of what she intended to do with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this card? Only she knew about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubt crept into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spun around and rushed toward Paula's office, a storm of thoughts swirling in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Mom was right all along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Queenie is so sweet and innocent. How could she be involved in anything like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about that million every month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried to Paula's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he reached the door, he overheard a conversation between Linda and Paula and paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Barnes, I honestly think Mr. Eric Marsh would make the best heir. If he understands what his father is truly like and learns about Queenie's plans, he will definitely help you. He's more reliable than anyone outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula shook her head in despair. "Linda, it's hopeless. Jeff and Queenie are like giant termites, hollowing out everything from within, and I didn't even notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie has siphoned off far more than 200 billion. In this time alone, she's moved around ten billion using different schemes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The company has been bled dry. Jeff's money has gone entirely to that bastard overseas. Out of the four children I have, two are already useless, and now the third is in line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie is cunning. She intends to frame Gale and Frank's accidents on Diana. Frank has already been thrown to the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only a few months remain before the year is up. In that time, she and Jeff will find a way to eliminate the third and fourth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've seen how Eric behaves. He would gladly sacrifice himself for Queenie. If she's the one to take him out, he would die satisfied, knowing it was from the one he cared about the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every word, Paula felt her heart shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda understood she was speaking out of pain, aware of the toll a lifetime of betrayal had taken on her friend, being deceived by a man and now watching her own daughter turn against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, we've been friends for years. Though I'm your secretary, I'm also your friend at heart. Can you really sit back and watch as your four sons are destroyed by Jeff and Queenie? Allow them to take everything and live happily ever after?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jeff has deceived you into marriage. He has children with other women, pouring all his resources into them while plotting to replace Diana and return Queenie to the family, treating her like a princess. This kind of man deserves to be sent to hell! How can you still hold onto him after all these years?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="460.html">« Prev</a><a href="462.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
