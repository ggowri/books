She was calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe she was numb from the heartbreak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing that Queenie stamped her feet in anger, she smiled brightly, "I am doing nothing but collecting evidence. Don't you like to frame me? I used to endure it before because I felt that we were a family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, we are not, so there is no need for me to put up with you. I planned to divorce and give up the assets. However, you sent those pictures to provoke me and to show me how much Mr. Gellar loves you and dotes on you. Of course, I have to make good use of the evidence you offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm keeping those pictures to file for divorce. I'll reclaim every penny that Mr. Gellar has spent on you during our marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, if he gave the money to you voluntarily, that was his business. I only want a fair and just outcome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Didn't Queenie like to provoke Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Diana then let her experience what it felt like to be provoked.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was furious. If they really went to court, she would be convicted of being a mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The movie had already started filming. She could not afford any accidents. She gazed at Steven with fear and grievance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, you gave me the money voluntarily, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glanced at Diana. "Diana, stop making trouble. I gave the money to Queenie voluntarily. If you need money, I can give it to you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's bad for our reputation if we go to court."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned deeply. The Gellar Group couldn't withstand a serious crisis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "Reputation? Making trouble? Why? It's not about my reputation, so I am fearless. I've made it clear that if Queenie messes with me once, I will get back at her tenfold or hundredfold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really believe that the harassment I encountered in the coconut grove today was just an accident?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glared at Queenie with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie narrowed her eyes, but Diana was fine, wasn't she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She breathed heavily in a panic. "Diana, were you harassed tonight? Why didn't you call me? I would have found someone to save you," Queenie said hypocritically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her insincere words made Diana feel sick. "Queenie, stop acting. Don't you know that your hypocritical appearance is disgusting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana turned around, swiped her card, and entered her room. It was time for Cecil to make a move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Queenie held Steven's hand with her other hand. "Steven, as long as you get divorced, Diana will no longer be a threat to me. You promised to marry me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But now, you are watching me being bullied. If she does file for divorce, I will be a nasty mistress. Although she is the third wheel in our love, since you two are not divorced, I will not be able to justify myself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, why don't you get a divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie cried in grievance, her voice trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven explained helplessly, "Diana and I can't divorce even if she wants to. When we got married, she didn't read the agreement. Our marriage is a lifetime bond. My grandfather will never allow us to break up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swiped his card and walked into his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was shocked. Steven and Diana had a prenuptial agreement. Why did Edward make such an agreement to tie two people who were not in love together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it didn't make sense. Steven always desired a divorce, but Diana didn't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Now, he became unwilling and used that agreement to convince her. What was going on?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="397.html">« Prev</a><a href="399.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
