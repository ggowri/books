She looked at him with disdain and asked, "Frank, what if we don't give the money back to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank stared at her twisted, ugly face, thinking, "How did I ever find her beautiful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the venomous Elsie looked utterly repulsive to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fuming with rage, he spat out, "Elsie, then we'll all die together in this ocean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie and the man beside her frowned slightly, then burst into loud, mocking laughter as if they had just heard the funniest joke in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them laughed heartily at his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their laughter stopped abruptly. Elsie's eyes gleamed with murderous intent as she sneered, "Frank, I only took a few million dollars from you, and you're chasing me like this? I'll give you a chance now. Write a voluntary gift agreement for me, stating that the money was willingly given to me, and you won't try to get it back. If you do that, I'll spare your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank smirked coldly, "And if I refuse?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was determined to make this woman pay. Once they reached shore, he would report her to the authorities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind him was the vast blue sea, breathtakingly beautiful. The shimmering water looked enchanting, enough to make anyone fall in love with the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Elsie's sneer deepened. She had already made up her mind to kill. That money, those millions of dollars, was more than she could ever earn in a lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tilting her head slightly, she smiled at Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, in that case, you're the one who's going to die today. I never loved you. All I ever wanted was your money. If it hadn't been for Queenie promising me one million dollars to seduce you, I wouldn't have wasted my time on you. You're nothing but a fool, destined to be ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The day before our wedding, Queenie transferred the money to me. Do you really think I'd spend my life with an idiot like you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned. "You mean it was Queenie who put you up to this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't understand why Queenie would do such a thing. He had treated her so well. For her, he had even sacrificed his relationship with his own sister, pampering her endlessly. Yet, in the end, it was Queenie who had orchestrated his downfall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's heart ached so much that he could barely breathe. He had imagined many things but never that Queenie was behind it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Staggering back a step, he clutched the side of the boat to steady himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie's face twisted with malice, her gaze dripping with contempt as she looked at him like he was nothing but a pathetic fool. "Frank, you really are stupid. Of course Queenie didn't want you to marry Paige. With the Sutton family's support, Queenie couldn't get what she wanted. What's happening to you now isn't unfair at all. You brought it on yourself by being so dumb! "</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was in total shock. Finally, he understood the truth behind everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He laughed bitterly, thinking, "So this is what it feels like to give your heart to the wrong person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't me that Queenie wanted. It was the Barnes family, my mother's company, and the assets from my grandparents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And I, for the sake of such a shameless woman, hurt my own sister and mother with my own hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank laughed bitterly, his face contorting with grief, his eyes filled with deep hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing his crazed laughter, Elsie's expression turned even more disgusted. She frowned, her voice dripping with disdain. "Frank, stop laughing. Let's deal with what's in front of us first. Are you going to write that voluntary gift agreement or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank suddenly glared at them with murderous intent. "Elsie, even if I die, I'm taking you both down with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crazed look in his eyes startled Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man beside her darkened his gaze. "Elsie, we're in the middle of the ocean. There are no cameras here. Kill him, and we can go live on the island. No one will ever bother us again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie considered it. If Frank didn't die, there would be endless trouble in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Resolving herself, she nodded. "Alright."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="381.html">« Prev</a><a href="383.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
