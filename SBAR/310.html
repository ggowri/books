When had that boy appeared?</p><p>After work, Diana went downstairs and ran into Frank waiting at the entrance.</p><p>As Diana got closer, she saw Frank, and her eyes suddenly filled with hatred and disgust.</p><p>Seeing the loathing in her eyes, Frank&#x27;s heart sank. &quot;Diana, I...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Get lost,&quot; Diana said, her tone dismissive.</p><p>Frank frowned. &quot;Diana, you&#x27;re so harsh. No wonder you can&#x27;t win Steven&#x27;s heart.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why would I want to win over a shameless scumbag? To disgust myself?&quot;</p><p>Right now, she just wanted to stay far away from Steven.</p><p>Wanting to win his heart? She&#x27;d have to be out of her mind.</p><p>Frank was taken aback. Diana had truly changed. Now, she was defiant and bold, no longer meek and compliant.</p><p>As Diana tried to leave, Frank quickly blocked her path. &quot;Diana, for the sake of being my sister, I&#x27;ll give you some money. Just leave here. Everyone says you&#x27;re just a country bumpkin. What do you know about design? Stop embarrassing the Marsh family.&quot;</p><p>Diana frowned, glaring at him. &quot;What did you say? What have I done? How have I embarrassed the Marsh family?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it you who&#x27;s the disgrace of the Marsh family? Aren&#x27;t you the one who&#x27;s malicious and selfish, Frank?&quot;</p><p>Frank was speechless, his expression pale. He pulled out his phone and opened a news article. &quot;Take a look. People say you don&#x27;t deserve the design director position. They think you slept your way up. And didn&#x27;t you drop out of high school?&quot;</p><p>Diana stared blankly at him for a moment, not expecting anything more.</p><p>But hearing such words from a blood-related brother still made her heart ache.</p><p>She glanced at his phone and saw the internet filled with insults against her.</p><p>Diana laughed angrily. &quot;Frank, are you out of your mind? What right do you have to come here and dictate my life?</p><p>&quot;And stop looking down on me with that superior attitude. I&#x27;m someone you can&#x27;t even reach.&quot;</p><p>Nolan&#x27;s warning from the other day hadn&#x27;t sunk in for him.</p><p>&quot;Also, do you think slandering me will make your life any easier? Frank, your days are numbered. I won&#x27;t bother with you anymore.&quot;</p><p>With that, Diana turned and walked away.</p><p>Frank was furious. Why did she always say such things, making him have nightmares every night?</p><p>&quot;Diana, why do you keep cursing me to die?&quot;</p><p>Diana looked at him and said, &quot;You won&#x27;t die, but you will be paralyzed. Is that realy any better?&quot;</p><p>In her past life, Frank had fallen into the water, and everyone thought he was dead. He was later found paralyzed from the waist down, but it didn&#x27;t stop his scheming. He was just born rotten.</p><p>At that time, she had even thought about helping him recover, but he didn&#x27;t trust her.</p><p>Her previous words were meant to scare Frank, to instill fear, but her words carried little weight, and he never believed her.</p><p>&quot;Diana, you just can&#x27;t stand to see me do well, can you?&quot; Frank&#x27;s gaze was icy as he stared at her.</p><p>Diana smiled. &quot;Aren&#x27;t you already down? Congratulations, you got played by your beloved Queenie, and your father snatched the deal from you. Doesn&#x27;t that feel awful?&quot;</p><p>Frank&#x27;s eyes flickered, but he said nothing.</p><p>Diana continued, &quot;Frank, you&#x27;re lucky. You weren&#x27;t the one taken away. I was. I&#x27;m the one who lost the Marsh family&#x27;s honor. Do I deserve death for that?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="309.html">« Prev</a><a href="311.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
