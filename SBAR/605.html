Don't become a fool whenever you meet Steven. Your brain is not for decoration. You should use it to think about whether Steven is worthy or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful. He might sell you and then have you count the money for him. You've already sold yourself twice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought with tears, "Steven is such an asshole. Why does he always take advantage of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling utterly powerless, Diana handed the keys back to Steven, her voice weak. "I won't go. Even if you threaten me with Grandma, it won't work. Steven, stay away from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at the key in his hand, then at Diana's distraught appearance, and frowned slightly, thinking, "What does she mean by this? She used to want to stick to me 24/7. She gets very upset when she can't be with me. And now, she keeps pushing me away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a few steps and said, "Oh right, I was so angry earlier that I threw your spare card into the fireplace and burned it. That shouldn't affect you, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I don't want anything of yours, and I don't want to owe you anything. There's no relationship between us except for that marriage certificate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Evan reminded, "Mr. Gellar, the meeting is about to start. It's an emergency meeting, and we must go back right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Diana's drooping shoulders, wanting to hug her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana was too angry to listen to anything and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then Luna said, "Diana, your dad has arrived. He's waiting for you in the lounge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback, thinking, "What is Jeff doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mood was terrible, and she didn't want to see him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell him to get lost! I don't have a father like him." Diana went straight to the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff came out of the lounge as Diana had never shown up, and he heard what she had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared angrily, "Diana, what did you say? I am your father, are you telling me to get lost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had no choice but to muster her strength and deal with Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to make a scene in the lobby and said, "I'm sorry. Let's talk in the lounge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff frowned slightly and followed her to the lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Eric, she glanced at him indifferently and sat on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, seeing Diana's indifferent eyes, looked at her with worry and pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sat down and stated his purpose. "Diana, I heard your so-called brother has recently completed a project abroad. He's given you all his shares, with nearly a dozen billion in profits, is that right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't asking but accusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wondered how he knew about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly remembered half a month ago, when she and Alexander went to eat and ran into Queenie and Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie must have told Jeff about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about Jeff's recent situation, she asked, "Why do you ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff smiled and said, "Now that our family has gone bankrupt, and I am your father, you should hand over this money or let me manage his company. You know my talents, right? Call him and ask when he can transfer the company to me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="604.html">« Prev</a><a href="606.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
