Just get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's fury reached a boiling point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale, equally furious, turned on his heel and stormed toward the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But as he reached it, he heard the sound of Diana's fragile sobs behind him. His fists clenched involuntarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale glanced back and saw her cradling her designs, tears streaming down her face. Guilt gnawed at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "No matter how angry I am, she is still my sister. But why can't she see reason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, Queenie is more talented than you. You should give her the chance," Gale said, trying to sound authoritative.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana whipped around, her eyes blazing with resentment. "Gale, you're utterly shameless! What does her talent have to do with me? Who do you think you are, demanding that I step aside for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you're so confident in her, why don't you help her make a name for herself? You have no right to ask me to give up my dreams! I've severed ties with the Marsh family, and to me, you're just a stranger. So why should I let her have my opportunity?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale faltered, scrambling for a response. "But this whole mess started because of you! If you hadn't called the cops..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana cut him off. "If I hadn't reported them, I'd just be waiting for them to humiliate me or worse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale, how could you be so cruel? This situation didn't happen because of me. It's you! Why should I be the one to suffer?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What gives you the right to lecture me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your mother may have given birth to me, but someone else raised me. I've paid back every ounce of kindness I owed your family. I don't owe you anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're just as shameless as your father, shifting blame onto others while you sit back and enjoy a clean conscience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're despicable. Just get out!" Diana's voice broke as she raged, her disheveled hair falling over her face, obscuring her vision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you..." Gale's voice trailed off as he realized that he was in the wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But you're fine, right? What do you care?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana let out a cold laugh but didn't respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'll return that line to him in a few days," she thought bitterly, bending down to gather the scattered designs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale furrowed his brow, curiosity creeping in. "Diana, you really are a designer? I thought you grew up in the countryside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah, I did grow up in the countryside. That's why you all look down on me, isn't it? I was abandoned at birth, left to fend for myself as a baby. How is that my fault? It has nothing to do with your family. So could you just leave already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale's heart sank as he saw the calmness return to her eyes. He wanted to explain that wasn't what he meant, but the words stuck in his throat. So, he turned and walked out, feeling the weight of his actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, the image of Diana mourning over her designs lingered in Gale's mind, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he had gone too far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, wait! It's Diana who's being unreasonable. I'm not in the wrong here," he reassured himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Gale left, Diana picked up the remaining sketches, many of which were beyond repair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wiping her eyes, she refused to let despair take hold of her. She reminded herself that time was on her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"One day, I will clean up those shameless people!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Taking a seat at her desk, she took a deep breath, grabbing a wet wipe to dab at her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They felt better, but Diana still didn't understand why she was so upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tears continued to flow, unbidden.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="170.html">« Prev</a><a href="172.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
