Thanks to your investment, the crew and director won't make things too hard for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, on the island, Queenie had the opportunity to climb into Steven's bed, but she wouldn't let him touch her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used a hallucinogenic powder to make Steven feel everything was real. It was the same trick she used on Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace had been obsessed with her ever since. He was bound to exhaust himself to the point of no return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't say a word but went into the cabin, instructing the captain to set sail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's boat had become a tiny black dot in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, she didn't actually go back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After they shook off Steven, the boat sailed for another three hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was enticed by the captain's words about another island where the tide was receding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That island, far from the city and untouched by pollution, had crystal-clear waters. The island was teeming with crabs and lobsters, which would gather in droves at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana decided to check it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie and Steven wouldn't be able to follow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven returned to the hotel only to find out that Diana and Cecil had not come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was furious, realizing he had been tricked by Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had gone diving at night, after all. Feeling a dull ache in the wound on his arm, he asked Evan to bring him the first aid kit to dress it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, unaware of Steven's injury, followed him into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Steven undressing, she approached to embrace him from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He dodged skillfully and looked at Queenie with a meaningful smile. "Do you really want to be a mistress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face turned pale instantly, and she said angrily, "Steven, how can you say that to me? I risked everything to save you from the fire. How can you make me the mistress? I want to be your legitimate wife. You promised to marry me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sneered, "If marrying me means you'll be willing to suffer with me, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie looked at him in confusion. "Steven, what do you mean? Why would you become penniless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My grandfather has another will. I don't know where it is, but it clearly states that if I divorce Diana, everything will be donated to society and charity. Once I divorce, the agreement automatically takes effect, and I'll be left with nothing. Would you be willing to suffer with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes widened in disbelief. "Steven, what kind of person is Diana? Why would your grandfather make such a will?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="410.html">« Prev</a><a href="412.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
