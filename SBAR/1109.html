With her sweet looks, her tearful appearance was the most captivating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Steven was telling her to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Humiliated and shocked, she stood frozen in place. She refused to accept it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She began to cry softly, "Mr. Gellar, I really know I was wrong. I promise I'll do better from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She crouched down, pretending to clean up the spilled coffee, but every movement was dripping with allure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned. Seeing that she wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t leave, he got up and walked away, heading to the med room to wait for Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe was stunned. Wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t she crying pitifully enough? Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even spare her a glance before walking away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Failing to seduce Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t discourage Chloe. In her mind, if she could make Mario give up everything for her, she could do the same with Steven. She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe Diana could ever outmatch her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe slowly cleaned up the coffee on the floor, her eyes constantly drifting toward the med room. She thought, "Diana, you have everything. So, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll take your husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the med room, Diana looked up as Steven walked in, a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing the coffee stain on his white shirt and the faint smell of coffee, she asked, "Did Tom make you coffee?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom loved coffee. She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t. She only drank white coffee, heavy on the milk, light on the coffee. Too much caffeine kept her up at night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven finally glanced at the coffee stain on his white shirt. "Diana, I</span><span>'</span><span>m here with you. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t worry, I won</span><span>'</span><span>t bother you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a quick glance. Seeing he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t planning to leave, she pointed to a chair nearby. "Go sit over there. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t disturb me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana went back to work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced around the lab. It was huge, filled with cutting-edge machines from around the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven turned to look at Diana, focused on her work. A slight smile crossed his face. He sat down on the chair and went back to checking his emails.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe knew Mario had been targeting Diana. Sitting in the lab's lounge, she sent him a message: [Darling, Diana's back. She's in the lab, and Steven's here too.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario replied: [Baby, keep an eye on Diana's moves. Their new product is about to launch. Make sure to send me the chip data in advance, and I'll reward you with another $10 million.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe felt a rush of excitement and replied: [Thank you, darling!]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe's eyes gleamed with greed. Ten million dollars was more than she could ever dream of earning in her lifetime. Yet, with Mario, it came so effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she knew greed could lead to trouble, Chloe couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t resist the temptation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By 9 p.m., Diana had finally finished preparing all the medication.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She handed the medicine to Steven, exhaustion written all over her face. "Steven, take a look at this. To prevent anyone from tampering with my work, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve marked each pill. Make sure Edward takes one every morning. His body will gradually recover."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing her exhaustion, Steven stood up, slipped his phone into his bag, and gently supported her. "Diana, let me take you home to rest first. Then I'll head to the hospital to see Grandpa."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and said, "Forget it, I'll go with you. Otherwise, you'll get tired too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled out a pack of white chocolate from his bag and handed it to her. "Here, sweetheart, have a piece of chocolate first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a glare, warning him not to call her sweetheart. Steven just smiled, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was indeed tired. She reached out for the chocolate. Steven tore open the wrapper before handing it to her. His thoughtfulness made Diana pause for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took a bite, her mouth instantly filled with a sweet, creamy flavor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is good," Diana said, glancing at him. "When did you buy it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at her. "Tom bought it and brought it in. He knows you like this flavor. He said when you're exhausted, you like to have a piece to recharge. You were so focused on work, you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even notice him come in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a small laugh. "I see. Tom always remembers what I like. We've been together for two years, and you say you love me, yet you don</span><span>'</span><span>t even know what I like."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven immediately shot back, "No, I do know. I know you like jam cakes, especially peach and blueberry ones."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You like seafood, and just like me, you don't like fatty meat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You like white dresses, but you prefer pink business suits. Honestly, red suits you better. It makes you stand out, highlighting your bold, striking beauty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're a great sleeper, you can fall asleep almost instantly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When you sleep, you like to keep your hands above your head, staying in the same position all night. Unless I'm next to you&mdash;then you change, holding me tightly as you sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nearly choked on his words. "Who</span><span>'</span><span>s holding you tight? Stop talking nonsense." Her face flushed, and even her movements while eating the chocolate slowed down a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her adorable reaction and just smiled quietly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two walked out of the dispensary and ran into Chloe at the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe took the initiative to apologize to Diana. "Ms. Bishop, I was out of line that day. I'm sorry, I was just too anxious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t mentioned it, Diana wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have even remembered what happened that day. After being whisked away on vacation by Steven, she had completely forgotten about Chloe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression darkened instantly. "Chloe, do you remember what you said that day?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry, Ms. Bishop. I was just too anxious that day. Please don't take what I said to heart, okay?" Chloe lowered her head, looking pitiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was startled by her delicate tone. Ignoring her expression, she said, "If you hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t brought it up, I</span><span>'</span><span>d have forgotten all about it. But since you did, let me warn you&mdash;if you lack team spirit, you</span><span>'</span><span>d better be ready to leave anytime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Chloe froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pleaded desperately, "Ms. Bishop, I know I was wrong. Please don</span><span>'</span><span>t make me leave. I worked so hard to earn Professor Cullen</span><span>'</span><span>s approval. Please, I</span><span>'</span><span>m begging you, don</span><span>'</span><span>t let me go. I know you</span><span>'</span><span>re strong. It was my fault that day, really. I</span><span>'</span><span>m new to this job and I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know how to deal with people yet. Ms. Bishop, can you forgive me just this once?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at her coldly. She looked so pitiful, so fragile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, she said, "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t feel any sincerity in your apology."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1108.html">« Prev</a><a href="1110.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
