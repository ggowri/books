Get out of there! Are you just going to sit around and wait for jail time? Hurry up and bring me the books, or we're both screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the company's gone, it's gone, but we still have a subsidiary. If we play our cards right, we could turn that into a big player in a few years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's chest tightened with anger and regret. He had been out of sorts for a while, but he never thought he'd be the one to sabotage himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jeff glanced around, he noticed more and more people gathering. Queenie looked increasingly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of rage, Jeff hung up the phone, his face pale with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Queenie into an embrace, tears streaming down his face. "What am I going to do, Queenie? Paula sold my company! What's next for me? That was my pride and joy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie paused, momentarily taken aback. She thought, "Paula really has some nerve, selling Dad's company to pay off her debts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, her phone buzzed to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed, she picked it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, it's Logan Ridley. Ever since your mom's company got pulled by the Azure Group, she borrowed 100 million from me to keep things afloat. I just found out your mom's company went belly up last night. When are you guys going to pay me back? I've been trying to reach her, but no luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt a surge of irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "What's wrong with Paula? Why is she borrowing money everywhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied, "Mr. Ridley, I have no idea. Mom divorced Dad to keep him out of her mess, and now I don't even know where she is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great... so my hundred million just vanished into thin air? If she can't pay me back, then it's on you guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ridley, I don't have that kind of cash. Once I track down my mom, I'll talk to her about it. But I've got to go now; I have other things to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Queenie hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable! Paula's out there borrowing money and now it's coming back to bite me. I can't believe she'd drag me into this mess! She's already divorced, and now she wants us to pay for her debt? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jeff, still seething, dialed Paula's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paula was out celebrating her newfound freedom with Linda and Elina, enjoying a lavish meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she settled into a private room, she spotted Jeff's call and chuckled to herself before answering, "Hey, Jeff! Are you having second thoughts? Calling me to beg for a reconciliation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grip on the phone tightened, his voice trembling with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, reconcile? Dream on. Why on earth did you sell my company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Jeff, I see you're not calling to patch things up. What does it matter to you? I told you before, that company was mine. I sold it to pay off my debts. Is that so wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wrong? You had no right to sell my company! That's my blood, sweat, and tears you're talking about!" Jeff's voice cracked as the room began to spin, darkness creeping in at the edges of his vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smirked at his distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This is just the beginning. He can't handle the heat? Jeff tried to play me and my kids for fools, coveting my money? Now, he'll have to face the consequences of my carefully laid plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's been a tough year, but I've been playing the long game, making nice with Jeff and Queenie just to keep them off guard while I sorted out the mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feigning sorrow, Paula replied, "Jeff, how can you blame me? I did this for your own good, you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bullshit! This isn't for my good, Paula. You're just looking out for yourself!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="572.html">« Prev</a><a href="574.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
