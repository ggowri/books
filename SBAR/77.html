You're all dirty from hugging Queenie. Stay away!"</span><span> </span><span>Her outburst took Steven aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued with his domineering warning, "Diana, you're being ridiculous. Who are you to talk about Queenie like that? What's dirty about her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Take a good look at yourself before you start judging others. You've got some nerve turning your nose up at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Let me tell you something - until we're divorced, if you even think about messing around with other guys or doing anything to betray me, don't expect me to play nice."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a sharp pain in her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lowered her gaze, Steven's words seemingly draining all the fight</span><span>ing intentions</span><span> out of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>his was how little she meant to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd given this man her entire youth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bitter smile tugged at her lips, but she didn't struggle or argue back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what she said, she'd be wrong anyway. She no longer had the energy or saw the point in defending herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed her sudden silence. She sat with downcast eyes, leaning against the car window, keeping as much distance between them as possible. An aura of loneliness seemed to envelop her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought back to Diana, who he'd known these past two years - quiet and </span><span>simple</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she was vibrant and innocent - the type that quickly caught men's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt incredibly frustrated. He just wanted Diana to behave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan glanced at Diana in the rearview mirror, his heart aching for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could she end up with such a jerk?" he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What a mess!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sighed to himself, "Guys like Mr. Gellar just don't understand love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's all about family interests, using anyone and anything to his advantage. Diana must still be helpful to him somehow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's the only one he seems to care about.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why wouldn't Mr. Gellar want a divorce if Diana's agreed to it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at the villa...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven got out of the car first. This time, Diana didn't put up a fight. She hated Steven touching her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her quietly exit the vehicle, not losing his temper again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't curse him either.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed to have reverted to the Diana from a few months ago - not arguing, not making a fuss, just quietly doing her own thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what he didn't realize was that Diana wasn't a quiet person</span><span> in nature</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>S</span><span>he had always been constraining herself, living up to the role of his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Free from that identity, she'd been like a bird released from its cage, living each day with joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn't stand this gloomy version of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hated even more how she kept trying to push him towards other women.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as they entered, Diana headed straight upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at the suit jacket he'd taken off, holding it out in Diana's direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He offered it, but no one took it. For a moment, he stood there dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, whenever Diana was home, she'd greet him at the door with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd dutifully take his jacket and put it away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she'd bustle off to the kitchen to whip something up for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His stomach was sensitive, so she'd brew him a soothing drink </span><span>every</span><span> evening. After drinking it, he'd feel relaxed from head to toe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now Diana was back, and she wouldn't even spare him a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Diana go upstairs, he finally couldn't help but say coldly,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I haven't eaten dinner yet. Go make me some."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana paused, turning to look at him. He spoke as if it were perfectly natural, forcing her to come back and be his nanny.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Whether you've eaten or not is none of my business. I've already had my dinner, anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Diana turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's cold voice drifted over. "Diana, get down here and cook. I want pumpkin soup! If I don't get it tonight, your company will go bankrupt tomorrow."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="76.html">« Prev</a><a href="78.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
