You'll give birth in two months, and I'll come see you then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her past life, Gale married Penelope, and she could barely recall many things that happened afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea never forgave Gale and ended up raising the child alone, living a happy life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Cecil, Diana's eyes shimmered with a smile. "Cecil, I'm leaving now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil tightened his grip on the list, his gaze intense as he asked, "Diana, how do you know these people? It's like you can predict everything beforehand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Heh..." Diana laughed bitterly, her face filled with sadness. She had been reborn, and having witnessed many lives, it wasn't surprising that she knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her pained smile, a deep sorrow filled Cecil's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's voice was ethereal yet colder than the night itself. "If I could foresee everything, I wouldn't have come tonight knowing Queenie would set me up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cecil, if you doubt me, you don't have to work with me. I've helped you as much as I can. Goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil quickly caught up, blocking her way. "Diana, that's not what I meant, I just think..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That I know everything and planned it all in advance?" Diana looked at him, her eyes gleaming as if with tears, yet dazzlingly bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's breath hitched. In the darkness, her expression was blurred, but he could feel the overwhelming sadness she carried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil stared blankly at her. The once carefree man now stood tall like a pine tree under the night sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed deeply at him as well. With someone like Cecil, she never considered sharing her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could only interact with him as a mere acquaintance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, they might not even remain friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In truth, Cecil probably preferred women who looked like Queenie. In her previous life, Diana had seen how much Cecil doted on Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil laughed in exasperation, his usual carefree demeanor returning. His tone carried a hint of reproach. "No, Diana, that's not what I meant. I just feel sorry for you. Everywhere you go, Queenie tries to set you up. I don't know how you knew these things would happen, but I'm grateful you saved the Farley family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's gaze hardened slightly, then she smiled, glancing toward the Foliot Mansion. "As long as you believe me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly whispered a few words in Cecil's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's expression darkened instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Cecil was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's smile turned enigmatic. "You'll find out tomorrow morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me take you home; it's so late..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not even nine yet, so it's not late. I didn't eat enough at the banquet, so I'll have dinner with my brother at home. Luna will take me back," Diana declined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright." Cecil hadn't expected her to refuse continuously, but he understood that there was no possibility of any relationship beyond friendship between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana seemed easy to get along with, but Cecil could sense her strong resistance to his advances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana saw him only as an ally, not even as a friend. Realizing the nature of their relationship, Cecil felt a jolt in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a faint smile, Diana saw Luna driving over and walked quickly toward the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was about to get in, her hand was grabbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana saw that it was Steven. She frowned slightly. "What are you doing? Let go. Aren't you worried your childhood sweetheart will get jealous, grabbing me like this in public? I don't want to be tomorrow morning's headline as the 'homewrecker.'"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="205.html">« Prev</a><a href="207.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
