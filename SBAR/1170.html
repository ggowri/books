"Diana, come on, say something! Can I be an uncle or not?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ever since his sister's wedding day, he'd been dying to become an uncle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded excitedly. "Hubery, congratulations&mdash;you're going to be an uncle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Hubery was over the moon, reaching to hug Diana, but Steven beat him to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, are you serious? I'm going to be a dad?" Steven swept her up in his arms, spinning her around in pure joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was already feeling queasy, and the spinning made her dizzy. "Okay, okay, stop! I'm getting dizzy. Put me down before I throw up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven immediately stopped, planting a gentle kiss on her lips as he gazed into her clear eyes, now glistening with tears. "Diana, thank you! Thank you for giving me a real family, for never giving up on me, for loving me through everything!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, enough with the thanks. I'm starving right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't believe she'd been so careless&mdash;a doctor who didn't even notice her own pregnancy. This baby's timing was different from the last one. But this baby, she would definitely carry to term safely. This time, she'd make sure the baby was born healthy, and she'd be there to watch them grow, to laugh together, to share countless happy moments.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, let's go eat right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took Diana's hand firmly, turning to Hubery. "Hubery, mind leading the way?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery shot him a look but didn't argue&mdash;for the sake of Diana's baby. Steven just smiled back at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone around Diana was so kind, and she was the kindest of all! Steven looked at Diana, grinning from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, after lunch we're flying back home. I want you checked out at a hospital back home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No, let's stay here a few more days. I want to spend time with Hubery."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery stopped walking and looked at her. "Diana, give me a week here. Let me wrap things up, then I'll take you back myself. It's time I headed home too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time he'd return to help her biological father. It was the one condition Grandpa Christmas had when he chose to raise them&mdash;to give the Bishop family full support when Diana came home. All these years, Grandpa Christmas had given them endless wealth, helping them build fortunes that would last generations. Grandpa was truly wonderful, and the three Morrison men had never treated them like outsiders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face lit up. "Hubery, you're really coming back with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery smiled warmly. "Yeah, even if you hadn't come, I was planning to head back this weekend anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh my God&mdash;then I came at the perfect time! Hubery, let's go, let's go! I'm absolutely starving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's smile was radiant. This was perfect&mdash;Hubery had forgiven her. The four siblings would never be separated again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hubery, we'll never be apart again. I promise I won't do anything stupid anymore." Diana laughed as she made her vow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery chuckled. "You've always been the type who won't turn back until you hit a wall, and even then you need to crash hard before you learn. Grandpa Christmas tried to talk sense into you, but you wouldn't listen. You never had a mother, so Grandpa could only bear the heartache and let you go find her. But seeing all the hurt you went through, he felt you were both pitiful and deserving of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed. "I totally deserved it, didn't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven squeezed her hand tighter. Diana felt his unease and smiled. "What's wrong? Are you sad?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her laughing so happily and shook his head. "No, I'm not sad. I just feel incredibly happy. Diana, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beyond gratitude, he didn't know what else to say. Diana looked at him sideways&mdash;when he got tender like this, it was absolutely devastating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beyond gratitude, he didn't know what else to say. Diana looked at him sideways&mdash;when he got tender like this, it was absolutely devastating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: "Yeah, making me crave all sorts of weird things."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently placed his hand over hers on her belly. "Our baby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked up at him. "Steven, are you happy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Happy? Diana, I'm over the moon. I'm going to be a dad." His voice was thick with emotion, eyes bright with unshed tears of joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt her own eyes well up. "I'm happy too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled her into his arms right there in the fruit store, holding her close. "Diana, thank you. Thank you for giving me this gift."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hugged him back. "Steven, I love you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I love you too, Diana. More than you'll ever know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They held each other for a moment, both overwhelmed by the magnitude of this moment. A baby. Their baby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery cleared his throat from behind them. "Uh, guys? Maybe we should head back to eat? The food's probably ready."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and Diana broke apart, both laughing through their tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven: "Right, you need to eat. The baby needs nutrition."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana rolled her eyes playfully. "Steven, you're going to be one of those overprotective dads, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely. I'm going to spoil both of you rotten."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They walked back to the restaurant hand in hand, Diana munching on her orange. The seafood had arrived&mdash;steamed fish with a light sweet and sour sauce, grilled prawns, and some vegetable dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a bite of the fish and sighed contentedly. "This is perfect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her eat with complete fascination, as if she were performing some miraculous act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery shook his head, amused. "You two are going to be insufferable for the next nine months, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana grinned. "Probably."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't even look embarrassed. "Definitely."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they ate, Steven kept asking if she needed anything, if the food was too salty, if she was comfortable. Diana found his fussing both endearing and slightly exasperating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I'm pregnant, not made of glass."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know, but I can't help it. I just want to take care of you both."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana reached across the table and squeezed his hand. "You are. Just by being here, by being happy about this&mdash;you're already taking perfect care of us."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1169.html">« Prev</a><a href="1171.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
