I don't have any evidence, but I know you're setting me up. You have always been so vicious." Penelope was certain that Diana was setting her up, thinking that Gale and the Marsh family would hate Diana even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gale did not hate Diana, instead he looked at Penelope nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I am quite vicious and have led to you going to jail, right?" Diana sat opposite Penelope with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't even look at Gale next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope looked at Diana and was very angry. "Diana, you set me up. You will be punished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "You won't see that, but I have seen your retribution. I have evidence of your conspiracy against Gale and Althea, but I have not provided it because I have been waiting for Queenie to send you here personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've always been all about her. She chose you to seduce Gale. Now her plan has succeeded. It's a pity that you two loved each other so much, but one of you is disabled and the other is in jail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tone was calm and brought Penelope back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana continued. "Penelope, I warned you that you were being used. Once you have no value, you will be abandoned immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope felt upset. Diana had reminded her, but she didn't care. Queenie was very good to her and helped her find Gale to take care of her. Penelope knew that Queenie was using her, but she wanted Gale's money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope looked at Diana. "Diana, I'm sorry. Queenie was the one who schemed against you before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, let me go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Why don't you let a newborn baby go? You are pregnant. Why didn't you act with it in mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and Rachel must have done more than just this one thing together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope said, "No, this is my first time. Rachel has done this several times before, taking advantage of her status as an obstetrician in the hospital. The perpetrator was her boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her boyfriend used the extortion money to gamble. It has nothing to do with me. Diana, I know you have a kind heart. No matter how Queenie treated you, you forgave her. Please, let me go. I will be a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In desperation, in order to be rescued, Penelope was willing to say anything and betray Rachel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Penelope deeply. Penelope was heartless and ungrateful, and had done many evil things. Now she was getting the punishment she deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were surveillance cameras here, and their chat just now would be recorded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood up and looked at Penelope. "Penelope, you can't even forgive yourself for the crime you committed, so what can I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the people you killed and Althea you hurt were in pain, did you ever feel any sympathy for them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana left after saying this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope sat on the ground in a daze. Now, she finally understood that she was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale asked Kyle to push him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Gale was about to leave, Penelope shouted, "Gale, I'm still pregnant with your child. You can't leave. Save me. Come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wimp, come back here. I don't want to go to jail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle turned around with murderous intent. If he didn't have a daughter, he would have killed Penelope with his own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leaving the police station, Gale looked at Diana's back and shouted, "Diana, wait a moment!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="582.html">« Prev</a><a href="584.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
