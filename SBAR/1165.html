We're really poor after all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Small team members like them are even poorer, relying on Elroy's support every month.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said, "Racing is really expensive. All the allowance my dad gives me every year is spent on racing. The economy hasn't been great these past two years, making money even harder. My dad still gives me $1 million a month for living expenses, so you should be satisfied."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The money my company earns, I spend it all on maintaining the cars. I can't even afford to date now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team member said, "Good thing you don't have a girlfriend, or you wouldn't be supporting us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy often complains about being poor and doesn't want to support his teammates forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy didn't continue talking to the team member but instead looked at Diana's car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw the car slow down and couldn't help but laugh. "Steven must have thrown up. The car's getting slower and slower. I told him not to go, but he insisted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy's teammate laughed. "Mr. Gellar wanted to experience it, and we couldn't stop him. After this one time, he won't want to do it again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the race car stopped at the finish line.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hadn't experienced such high-speed action in a long time and was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took off her helmet and looked at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly opened the car door and threw up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy saw Steven throw up and laughed. Considering Steven was his sponsor, Elroy got up to bring him some water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly got out of the car, ran to Steven's side, and patted his back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said nothing and handed the water Elroy brought to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven hadn&rsquo;t eaten much in the morning, and he felt much better after throwing up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took the water Diana handed over, rinsed his mouth. His face was pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She helped him stand up and led him to sit in the nearby lounge to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana figured Steven wouldn&rsquo;t be able to eat the lamb later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy sat not far away, holding back the urge to laugh out loud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn&rsquo;t listen to advice, so he deserved this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several team members didn&rsquo;t dare to laugh openly, so they all turned their backs to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all tried hard to hold back their laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Elroy couldn&rsquo;t hold back his laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was in pain. But perhaps this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for him. Despite the pain, he saw Diana driving the race car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He witnessed a different side of Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was outstanding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From now on, Steven decided to personally accompany her in experiencing everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Elroy and said, "Elroy, shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry. I really couldn't hold it in. I just reminded Mr. Gellar not to go. That&rsquo;s not something an ordinary person can handle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy loved racing from the start. When he was little, he practiced like crazy on simulators. After getting into real racing, he felt incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't feel car sick at all. No matter how fast, he only felt thrilled and excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana and said, "Diana, I'm fine. Don't worry. I feel much better now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him with concern and took a tissue from her bag to wipe the sweat off his forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll get used to it over time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, seeing Steven couldn't take it anymore, Diana told him to close his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Closing his eyes made him feel much better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana gets carsick, she closes her eyes, focuses on feeling the speed, and shifts her attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her hand tightly and whispered, "Darling, I'll experience every one of your skills with you. We have a lifetime ahead of us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said helplessly, "Stop talking. Are you still feeling unwell?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head and said, "I'm much better. Just now, I followed your advice, closed my eyes to feel the speed and your breathing, and I felt much better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll be fine after a rest," he said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very touched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time to eat," Elroy shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked Steven, "Steven, can you eat now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't want to eat, but he was hungry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There aren't any good restaurants around here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Elroy came over with a plate and said, "Diana, Mr. Gellar, you two share one plate. This plate has vegetarian dishes and some roasted lamb."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said, "You're welcome. Diana, we'll be good friends from now on. Relax a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as we win this rally, we'll be one step closer to the World Championship. I promise you, we will make it to the World Championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Diana knows Elroy's capabilities, Steven decided to invest in his team.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Elroy, I believe in your abilities. Go eat now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy is a straightforward person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You all should eat more. The competition takes a lot of energy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana doesn't want to gain weight anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana handed the water to Steven, letting him drink some before having lunch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt much better. The aroma of the food gave him an appetite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He fed Diana lamb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, this lamb looks pretty good. Give it a try."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lamb is well-prepared, no gamy taste, and the texture is excellent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was surprised. "Delicious. Try it. It tastes different from other lamb."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven usually doesn't like lamb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently said, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had lunch together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy directly gnawed on half a lamb leg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at them, smiled, and said, "They have such a good relationship, truly enviable."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1164.html">« Prev</a><a href="1166.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
