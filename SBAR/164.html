"Steven, how pathetic. Are you really so afraid to own up to your actions?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're a tech wizard yourself. You've seen the photos and videos. They're real, and they were taken while we were married&mdash;your affair with Queenie. You both are equally shameless. So, aside from the divorce, don't come looking for me. There's nothing left to discuss. I don't want a dime from you; just go get the divorce papers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've said it a million times. Why haven't you heard me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You used to throw divorce papers at me every month. I'm the one who's been wronged here. You know everyone thinks you're some kind of genius, but honestly? You're just as repulsive as the Marsh family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's brow furrowed, his voice tinged with urgency. "Diana, you don't believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She let out a cold laugh. "When strangers believed me while you were busy siding with the Marsh family, did you ever truly believe in me? As my husband?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His silence spoke volumes, and the gloominess in his eyes deepened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven realized, for the first time, that he had never trusted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the car pulled up, Diana opened the door and slid inside, glancing back at Steven. "Remember to call me tomorrow if you're going through with the divorce. If you don't, Queenie will find a way to make you. We'll see who wins this game."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She waved goodbye, her smile sweet yet laced with finality, as if their divorce was already a done deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt a knot tighten in his stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if Diana knew everything, and he was just a fool playing the part of the jester in her grand performance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Steven watched her car drive away, a menacing glint flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He mused, "What is Queenie up to? And where has Cecil disappeared to these past few days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He snapped, "Evan, Diana doesn't believe me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan's laughter was hollow. "Oh, come on, Mr. Gellar. You never believed Ms. Bishop either, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven squeezed his eyes shut, trying to suppress the anger bubbling inside him. "Let's just go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He turned away, his tall figure radiating a sense of solitude and desolation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan shook his head, thinking, "What a stubborn guy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If only he'd wake up sooner. Now it's too late!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But as he watched Steven's lonely silhouette fade, Evan couldn't help but feel a twinge of sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wondered, "He's been pitiful since childhood. Queenie was there for a while, and sure, Steven treated her well&mdash;but he's got to stop being so blind. If Diana's telling the truth, then the perfect, business-savvy Steven is just as easily manipulated by the girl he grew up with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's acting skills are top-notch; without Diana's pushback, her dark deeds would have stayed hidden."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once in the car, Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, I'm still digging. I found a hotel photo from the Grand Hyat in Capitole, but it doesn't have a timestamp. I'll go there tomorrow to get the details."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven nodded, recalling the photo. "Find out everything you can. That guy looks just like me&mdash;it's nearly impossible to tell us apart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan raised an eyebrow, puzzled. "Mr. Gellar, have you thought about asking your dad? Is it possible you have a twin brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned, uncertainty washing over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hadn't seen any signs of a twin, but the idea lingered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan continued, "Mr. Gellar, maybe we should investigate this further? Your father could be the key to uncovering the truth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan sensed that this situation was more complicated than it appeared. If he wanted to uncover the truth, going after Steven's father was the most straightforward approach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze darkened, icy resolve settling in. "Just find out what you can. No need to meet him. Have Edison handle it tomorrow. You keep digging into this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't want to see him; he's got a trail of women and illegitimate kids behind him. It disgusts me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan thought to himself, "Steven still won't face his father, but he's the one who knows the truth."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="163.html">« Prev</a><a href="165.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
