Paula is still alive; only one of her four sons has died. You got her company, but it feels like we have gained nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie felt like everything around her was unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie placed a hand on her belly and said, "Mom, you should look into Levi's family and see what they're about."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie shot her a confused glance and frowned. "Aren't you planning to marry Steven? And what about that man you ran off with? Wasn't he the one you loved the most? Now you're talking about Levi?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie closed her eyes, anguish etched across her face. After a long pause, she opened them and replied, "Mom, I feel like Levi is using me too."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Amelie's eyes widened with shock, pain, and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current ending was really not what she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not the outcome she had wanted. She wanted Paula and her sons dead, herself married to Jeff, and to own assets worth billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? She was still hiding in the shadows as a mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had caught on to her affair with Jeff. If she were outed, her children would remain illegitimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I can get an abortion, but we need to frame Diana for it," Queenie said with a sneer. "I'll pretend to be her to get it done."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was speechless; she underestimated Queenie's hatred for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, please don't do this. If you get caught, your life will be ruined. You can't make it. You need to listen to me, do you understand?" Amelie urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie replied, "No, Mom, I have a plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was alert. "What kind of plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Queenie laid out her scheme, Amelie considered it and thought it might actually work.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That could work, but Queenie, why are you still fixated on Diana? She's not a threat to you anymore," Amelie asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't pinpoint why, but seeing Steven defend Diana had stirred jealousy and anger within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, everything that belonged to the Marsh family and to Steven should be hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Diana knows what I did. She's started to retaliate against me. She's not the meek, submissive girl she used to be," Queenie explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's eyes widened. "Has she told Steven?" she asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt frustrated. "Mom, don't you get it? It's because Diana revealed everything to him that he's been so cold to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But tonight, when I had a stomachache, he left Diana to take me to the hospital. I didn't expect that I would get pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's anxiety heightened. As an outsider, she could see Steven's true nature clearly. "No, no, you need to give up on Steven. You saved his life, and he'll remember that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Diana is still his wife. If you scheme against him, you'll only push him away. If the media finds out that Diana is his wife, you'll be a mistress in every sense of the word. I can't let that happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men always prioritize their interests over feelings. He even denied his biological father to secure his position these past years. You're just his lifesaver, and he's already returned that favor. If you plot against him, it'll end badly for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie felt furious. Why was everything going wrong? So many things had seemed to align perfectly before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Steven won't let me be insulted. He'll clear things up," Queenie insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he's giving you five million dollars a month. If Diana finds out, the court will find evidence. Are you out of your mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven is already suspicious of you. If you really do this..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="628.html">« Prev</a><a href="630.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
