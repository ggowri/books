"I'm fine. It's just that Queenie's dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula let out a sigh of relief. "Diana, thank God you're okay. I'm so sorry, sweetheart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at her through tears&mdash;her daughter was truly beautiful. "Diana, don't blame yourself. Queenie deserved to die. After all the terrible things she did, she had it coming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Queenie was gone. No more evil people could hurt her daughter. Paula cried, "Diana, I'm sorry. I failed to protect you. I let you down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head with a gentle smile. "Mom, you didn't let me down. Let's just forget about the past."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears streamed down Paula's cheeks. She had finally lived to see this day&mdash;the day her daughter would call her "Mom" again, the day her precious girl would forgive her. "Get some rest, Mom. I'm going to see Dad tomorrow, and I'll be back in a while."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During Paula's coma, she had received a call from Grandpa saying she should return home tomorrow to see her father.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your father? Who is he?" Paula knew the man from back then had been impressive, but if he knew about Diana's existence, why hadn't he come back for her all these years? She grew anxious. "Diana, is your father married? If he knows about you, why hasn't he come looking for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula worried she might be mistreated. A husband suddenly having a daughter appear&mdash;no wife would be happy about that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat on the chair beside the bed. "When Jeff dumped me in the countryside back then, Grandpa happened to be coming back to find me. He took me away. He's my real grandfather, and he's been raising me all these years. But Dad's family seems to have a lot of internal conflicts. For my safety, Dad didn't bring me back home&mdash;Grandpa raised me instead. Now that the family danger is gone, Dad wants me to come home. It's not that he didn't want to find me. Every year, my birthday gifts and clothes were all bought by Dad. He would secretly come to see me too. He loves me very much, so you don't need to worry about me being bullied."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had decided to go back and see her father. "Also, after Dad found out about me, he never married."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula felt relieved. That way, no one could bully Diana. "Diana, be careful when you go back. You're pregnant now, so you need to be cautious about everything. Don't let anyone with bad intentions get close to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was very worried about her and wanted to go with her to take care of her, but she had no right to do so. She just hoped Diana would return safely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay! When I come back, we'll have the wedding. Mom, you and my brothers can come to my wedding."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was thrilled that her daughter had invited her to the wedding. "Diana, that's wonderful." Paula couldn't stop crying, not knowing what to say. This moment was too perfect. If her past self had truly been that evil, then in this life, because she chose to pull back from the brink, she now had this happiness. "Diana, I'll prepare your dowry. You're my precious daughter, and I'll prepare everything for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. "You don't need to. The four brothers aren't even married yet, and I can make my own money. Besides, Dad and the Young family have already given me the best of everything. I'm already very wealthy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to her, the four Gale brothers would face much more in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, what I leave for you is yours. When I get out of the hospital, I'll start preparing for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was her only wish and what she owed her daughter. One wrong thought had almost made them miss each other for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't say anything. Perhaps this was her heart's desire. When she had jumped with Queenie to save her, all the hatred in Diana's heart had instantly disappeared. "Okay!" Diana agreed with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula smiled too, happier in this moment than she had ever been. "Diana." Paula gripped her hand tightly, with a thousand words she didn't know how to express.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A thousand words swirled in her heart, but she didn't know how to begin. Diana stayed and chatted with her for a long while, and after talking through some things, Paula's mood gradually lifted. Paula urged Steven, "Steven, you should take Diana home to rest now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did Steven stand up and walk over to help Diana to her feet. "Diana, let's go home and rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, get some good rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula smiled warmly. "I will."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana and Steven stepped outside, they saw Gale, Eric, and Althea were all still there. The two brothers grinned at Diana like idiots, and she smiled back, saying goodbye before heading home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was exhausted and slept the entire ride home again. Steven was genuinely worried about her sleep patterns&mdash;she slept so deeply it made him anxious. He'd had a doctor check her out, and the doctor said it was normal. When they reached the villa, Diana woke up, rubbing her still-sleepy eyes. "Steven, go pack your things. We're leaving first thing in the morning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked down at her. "I was hoping to take you to the hospital for a checkup tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. "The baby's right here in my belly. We can check again in a few days."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way. Tomorrow morning we're going to the hospital first, then to the airport. I won't feel right if we don't get you checked."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was adamant. If her condition wasn't suitable for travel, they'd postpone the trip. But Leopold had sounded urgent on the phone, and he was worried something had happened to his father-in-law.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To put his mind at ease, Diana agreed. "Fine, call and arrange it. Just an ultrasound&mdash;it'll be quick."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought for a moment, then immediately pulled out his phone to call the director of his hospital, asking for an OB-GYN to bring equipment over so Diana wouldn't have to make the trip.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven added, "Diana, the first-floor room is empty. Why don't we move all the examination equipment into the house? Then you can have checkups at home from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought it was a great idea. "Sure, once I start showing more, I'll be even more tired. Having checkups at home means I won't have to keep running to the hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting her approval, Steven had the director arrange everything immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless. "..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really was a man of action now. Anything involving her, he'd handle right away. When Steven wanted to spoil her, he gave it his all&mdash;every good thing he could offer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She always felt this way about Steven&mdash;love and hate intertwined. But now, with the baby, the hatred had faded considerably, leaving mostly love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana flashed him a radiant smile. "Honey, it's so good to have you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those words should have been Steven's to say. He pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Diana, I should be the one saying that&mdash;it's so good to have you!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1176.html">« Prev</a><a href="1178.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
