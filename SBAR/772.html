"Miss," he drawled with an ambiguous charm, "we're the special service you requested."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana swiftly grasped his implication, and an indignant laugh escaped her lips. "Do you even know where we are? This is a seven-star hotel right in the heart of the city. The very idea of 'special services' here is absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two seem really eager to poke out your sticks in your pants. There's an elevator right over there. Maybe it'll help you cool off that heat."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, who had just opened the door, was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poke out their sticks?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men looked livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some nerve, lady. It's your lucky day that we're even interested in you. You should be grateful to lie back and spread your legs for us. And don't forget, this is a seven-star hotel. We booked a room to get in. If we say you came to us, who's going to believe you?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow's headlines will be all about your threesome game."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met their taunting gazes with a smile. "Who sent you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, it doesn't matter who sent us. What matters is that you once had ten male models at your beck and call. The two of us can give you a night you won't forget."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten male models she knew had gone on to become celebrities in her company and were now quite famous.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men before her were undoubtedly attractive, but they were too lean, almost scrawny, and utterly unappealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two really think highly of yourselves, don't you? With bodies like those, you think you can satisfy me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cast a disdainful glance downward at the pair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a way, it was clear that whoever was behind this had grossly underestimated her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, everything about their appearance and physique loudly proclaimed "gigolo".</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, do you guys even earn enough each night as gigolos to afford breakfast the next day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but feel a twinge of concern for them. With such slender frames, could their waists even withstand the rigors of their nightly work?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men's faces twitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana singled out one of them with a pointed finger. "You, you've been burning the candle at both ends. The exhaustion is etched deep into your eye sockets. Your tongue's red with a thick, yellow, greasy coating, and your breath could knock out a horse. You're dealing with liver issues and blood stasis. Your sperm? The mortality rate is sky-high, and the ones that survive barely crawl. Your complexion is ashen, and your lips have a purplish hue. You're plagued by chest pains, bouts of depression, and fits of anger. There's a constant ringing in your ears, and your hearing isn't what it used to be. At this rate, fatherhood is a distant dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was stunned, realizing she had hit the nail on the head with every symptom.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shifted her gaze to the other. "And you. The herpes and erosions on your face are impossible to hide under even the thickest foundation. When you look up, it's clear your lymph nodes are swollen and uneven. You have AIDS. Seek treatment now before it's too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men were paralyzed with fear, collapsing on the ground with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked and thought, "Scared now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked down at them and wore a radiant smile. "What's there to be afraid of? You came here to ruin me and tarnish my reputation. These surveillance cameras can capture sound, can't they? If I release this footage, do you think your pimp will still want you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men were silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words were like a bomb, shocking them to their core.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the acne-ridden face glared at her. "We only have 20 minutes left. No matter who she is, we need to have her get laid. We'll have plenty of time to get back and seek treatment. Plus, we'll still get one million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other man rose to his feet, steeling himself for what was to come, and pushed Diana back into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Steven was about to intervene, a dark figure darted out from beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" The man collapsed to the ground, clutching his stomach, writhing in agony. He stared at Diana in disbelief. How could she have kicked him away with such force?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="771.html">« Prev</a><a href="773.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
