If Steven missed out on Diana, he indeed wouldn't find a woman who loved him more.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't greedy at all; she didn't want a single cent from Steven in the divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had no clue what was going on in Evan's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed his actions with Queenie were purely out of gratitude for saving his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't love. He only attended banquets and went on business trips with Queenie for work-related matters, nothing romantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Real love," he thought, "should be about two people simply being together, sharing conversations and dreams about the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He googled dating tips, and his screen instantly flooded with all sorts of advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[First tip: Pick a clear night and take her to a quiet spot outside the city. Lie down on the soft grass and gaze at the starlit sky together.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Point to the brightest star and tell her. "Like that star in this vast universe, you shine uniquely in my heart. I want to be like this starry sky, always by your side, listening to your every joy and sorrow."]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven liked the idea of stargazing, but the words felt way too cheesy, and he couldn't imagine himself saying that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Second tip: Plan a surprise weekend getaway just for the two of you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Don't reveal the destination. Just take her hand on the day of departure and lead her on this mystery journey. Take care of everything - from cozy accommodations to local delicacies - letting her feel your thoughtfulness through these surprises.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Steven read these tips, the more frustrated he became.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had taken Queenie on a trip to a pretty romantic island.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back now, Diana had called him dirty, and honestly, he felt pretty disgusted with himself, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven slammed his phone down in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of how foolish he'd been all these years made him take a deep breath and close his eyes. "Have you found anything on that man who was with Queenie?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan went silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I got hold of Queenie's other phone. After unlocking it, it was pretty clean, except for those videos of you two in bed. Got to say, I was shocked! I didn't know you were such a player."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to find any traces of the mystery man, he was starting to suspect it was Steven himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eyes, the expressions - everything matched perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you blind, too? On every business trip, you and I shared a room while she had her own. You seriously think I'd touch her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's voice grew hoarse with rage, his eyes blazing with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refused to take the blame for this disgusting mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That man looks exactly like me, but I'm sure he's my dad's illegitimate son.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And my shameless father is secretly helping that bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, Grandpa's been gone for almost a year now. He had managed the business abroad before, but what was the real reason he never wanted to come back?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Grandpa also discovered something? Yesterday, he even messaged me, warning me to be careful, that there were spies around me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven fell into deep thought. Thinking about Diana being with Cecil made anger surge through him like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the day he was born, only Diana had ever been able to make him this angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana no longer had a place for him in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan watched Steven's troubled expression and suggested, "Mr. Gellar, what if we knock out your dad and check his phone? We might find some clues there. What do you think of this plan?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="717.html">« Prev</a><a href="719.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
