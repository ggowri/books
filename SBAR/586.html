The people arranged by Paula will not leave until Queenie shows up. Queenie will reorganize the company and fire some employees. Among these employees, there will be the backbone of the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She will replace these people with her own people. By then, even if Queenie finds out that this company is just a shell, it will be too late. Without the previous resources, the company will not be able to operate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought that by then, she should be able to see Queenie furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Business was tough right now. And even if Queenie had the ability, she could only maintain the status quo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This period was Diana's best time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Althea's baby was a month old, Althea would leave the country with Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, will Mr. Powell be interested in the project we are working on now?" Luna was a little worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Don't worry. As long as we have good skills, we can do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was pleased. In the past two years, Diana had actually been developing software.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you've been very busy these past few years. If Miss Hadley knew, she would be very happy. She invited you to join her research team, but you refused. I heard that she was sad for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled guiltily, "I don't like staying in the laboratory. Those data are too boring. That kind of life is not suitable for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't stay partly because of Steven, but more because she really didn't like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna said nothing more. A person's energy was limited, and Diana was already very good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind and snow were lighter at noon. When they arrived at the restaurant, Diana got out of the car and asked Luna to park the car first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander arrived earlier and was already waiting for Diana at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander went to pick her up with an umbrella. He was considerate and leaned sideways to block the wind for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Alexander, long time no see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't seen you for half a month. You've lost weight." Alexander felt distressed. Diana did seem to have lost a lot of weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "No! Alexander, I just wear more clothes in winter. I eat well every day on the island. Even though it's snowing, I can still eat fresh seafood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Eating seafood every day is not nutritionally balanced. Come in. I ordered your favorite foods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the door and let Diana in. Looking at her happy face, Alexander smiled gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ran in with a smile. Alexander followed her in after closing the umbrella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and Evan also came here to have breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was in the car and saw Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was slightly stunned. He hadn't seen her for half a month. She had lost weight, making her facial features look more three-dimensional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the past half month, Steven felt uneasy without her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her and Alexander's intimate actions, Steven clenched his fists with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward liked Alexander very much, so did Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought, "Diana said she loved me, but what about now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is she in love with Alexander now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her love is so cheap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered. Diana didn't take his last warning seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she still dared to contact other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked in with a gloomy face.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="585.html">« Prev</a><a href="587.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
