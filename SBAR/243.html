"Olivia, thank you so much. You and Diana are truly benefactors of the Farley family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. "Cecil, don't say that. We're friends. We're just happy to have helped you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Always leave some room for goodwill. It makes things easier in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita was delighted that her son had escaped a disaster. "Olivia, Diana, the doors are always open to you both. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia and Diana smiled and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia said, "Cecil, remember to wear the jade pendant around your neck. After escaping the disaster, you can either take it off or leave it on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil swallowed nervously. "I... will never take it off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia smiled and took a string of jade beads from her bag, handing it to Rita. "Mrs. Gellar, Diana is my dear friend. I've heard about the previous incident. Thank you for believing in her. These beads will protect you and keep you healthy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita was moved and pleased. "Olivia, thank you! Speaking of the last incident, it was Diana who saved my family. Without her, we might not have survived another year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana remained silent; she had only acted to avoid trouble with Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew Cecil's stubborn nature all too well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia needed to pack her things, so she and Diana left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did Rita relax, collapsing onto the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, are you okay?" Cecil asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil looked at his grandmother with deep concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita raised her hand, signaling him to remain silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She needed a moment alone; today's events had shaken her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil stayed silent, stood up, and poured a cup of warm water for his grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, have some warm water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita smiled lovingly. "You're becoming more considerate. It makes me proud to see this change in you. Focus on learning how to manage the company so you can help your parents and bring honor to the Farley family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil grinned brightly. "Grandma, I've been working hard lately. Don't worry, I'll study well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"See how talented I am, Grandma? I can even ride motorcycles and race cars, and I won first place this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Rita grew more worried. "You're still talking about that dangerous racing? Didn't I tell you not to do it? Look at Gale. He's crippled now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil scoffed. "That family is cold-blooded, and now they're facing retribution. Grandma, you don't know how cruel they are. They don't even treat Diana like a human.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know what Gale did three days before the race? He stole Diana's design plans and gave them to Steven's company, causing Diana a massive loss. Gale is really something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita sighed. "Life is full of all kinds of people, isn't it? Now, go check on the company. It puts my mind at ease knowing you're there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was just about to find a way to deal with Queenie when he heard his grandmother, and he dashed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was preparing to shoot a film and often went out. Tonight, she had dinner plans with Steven to stir up publicity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie arrived at the restaurant first. As soon as she stepped inside, she stumbled awkwardly and fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah..." she screamed in fear.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="242.html">« Prev</a><a href="244.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
