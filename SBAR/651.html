"Sorry, but there's nothing left for us to talk about. Our ties are severed. Let's each live our own lives from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already said everything that needed to be said and done everything that needed to be done.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cutting ties, she informed Paula that Jeff had another woman and that Queenie was Jeff's biological daughter, thus repaying the debt of being brought into this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula knew Diana would never forgive her, but she still wanted to express her gratitude. In a low voice, she said, "Thank you for telling me about Jeff."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "There's no need to thank me. I should be thanking you for giving birth to me. I told you the truth back then to repay the debt of you carried me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula cried quietly, realizing the cruel reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for that debt, she would have remained in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, it wasn't until Queenie devoured the family business and her four sons were murdered that she finally learned the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Paula cry her heart out stirred nothing in Diana. Whatever love once existed had been squandered in their previous lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula suddenly blocked Diana's path, asking in a trembling voice, "Diana, can't you truly forgive me? I know I was wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana scoffed, staring at Paula's tearful face. Diana looked somewhat similar to Paula, and she had inherited Paula's beautiful eyes. "But tell me, can anyone genuinely forgive a mother who once wanted to kill her own child?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, you've already killed me once, and I've repaid my debt. I will never forgive you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember that, and please stop interfering in my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, Paula had been in a position to stop Steven from killing her, but as Diana's mother, she chose the family's interests, her four sons, and her precious adopted daughter over Diana's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Paula was in utter disbelief, shaking her head in pain. "Diana, no! I didn't... Diana, you must have misunderstood something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Misunderstanding?" Diana chuckled bitterly. "There's no misunderstanding. Without my warnings, you would've eventually chosen to kill me for the sake of your beloved adopted daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warned you because I wanted to live. So, please, stop disrupting my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was as cold as ice atop a snowy peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula froze, realizing the harm she had inflicted on Diana in favor of Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "In the end, things would have spiraled to me personally killing my own biological daughter, only to be destroyed by Queenie in the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's schemes were vicious, but why had Paula been so bewitched by her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always doted on Queenie and treated Diana like she was invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was talented, sweet-talking, and knew exactly how to win Paula's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana had always been seen as a bully to Queenie, and Paula had, without question, sided with Queenie every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "Do you get it now? Parental favoritism is like a venomous snake. Your bias fueled Queenie's cruelty towards me because she always knew you'd unconditionally protect her and blindly blame me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You raised a viper with a naturally poisonous nature. Isn't that just poetic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words cut deeper than any knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula staggered back a few steps, almost collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, who had quickly rushed over, caught Paula just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't look at Steven, turning to leave with Cecil by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched Diana's retreating figure, lips pressed into a thin line. He let out a cold chuckle. He couldn't help but wonder, "Between Cecil and Alexander, whom will Diana choose?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will she really rather be with them than want me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula helplessly watched as Diana walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing it was Steven who was holding her up, she felt a surge of anger. "Steven, is this what you and Queenie wanted? My Barnes family was completely ruined. I beg you, let Diana go."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="650.html">« Prev</a><a href="652.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
