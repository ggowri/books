Cecil was stunned. Seeing that it was Steven, Cecil became agitated and looked at Diana and asked, "Diana, why is he here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's voice instantly became full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was also stunned. Cecil should be weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was discerning and could see that Cecil was deliberately pretending to be pitiful in front of Diana to gain her sympathy. Cecil was hateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said in a low voice, "Diana, didn't you see that he was pretending to be weak for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned around and looked at Steven, revealing a wicked smile. "No way. Cecil is scared. I want to stay here with him. You go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "But it's so late..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "What's wrong so late? We are in a civilized society now. Is there something shameful going on between Cecil and me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was slightly stunned and remembered something. These were the words he once said to Diana in order to accompany Queenie. Now that the positions were reversed. Diana gave him his words back. He only felt anger burning all over his body and a pain in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought, "Did she feel as bad then as I do now?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unknowingly, I had caused Diana so much harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder she said that she could not get over those things."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared at Cecil, showing no emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat on the sofa beside him and said calmly, "Since Mr. Farley doesn't dare to sleep, then I and my wife will stay here with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was anxious and felt that Steven was too shameless. "I don't want you to accompany me. I only want Diana to be here. And you are more like Queenie's husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil still hadn't grown up, and now he was like a sulky child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was speechless. The past could not be erased.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really did those things in the past. And in the eyes of outsiders, he really treated Queenie as his future wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt guilty and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Steven didn't leave, Diana gave Cecil a pill. "Cecil, take this pill. You won't feel so bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil trusted Diana. After taking the pill, he still held Diana's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing light blue trousers and pajamas. He looked quite sexy, with firm muscles and a seductive aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at the changes in Diana's eyes and knew that Diana was confused by Cecil's sad look.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This damn man!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven wanted to kill Cecil!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Cecil lay down, he looked at Diana nervously, fearing that she would leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil asked, "Diana, you won't leave me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and nodded. "I won't. You will be fine after tonight. Tomorrow, I will take you to buy stocks and let you make a lot of money. Be happy. Nothing makes me happier than making money."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled happily, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil felt sleepy. He looked at Diana, unwilling to fall asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he felt uncomfortable, Diana said, "Cecil, it's okay. Go to sleep first. I will stay here with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was relieved. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil glanced at Steven provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were gloomy. He glanced at Cecil coldly, warning him to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at least self-disciplined and polite, but Cecil was simply a jerk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Diana only loved Steven and never cared about any other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Steven was no longer the only one she cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were Alexander, Cecil, and the boy Steven met last time in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Steven felt powerless.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="668.html">« Prev</a><a href="670.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
