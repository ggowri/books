"Of course, you'll become luckier and be true to yourself. No one can truly bully you. The you at that time will be the real you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil didn't quite understand, but since meeting her, he had been constantly improving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often heard her say things like, "Be true to yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "But who knows what the true self is? But there was one thing he understood. If the life you're living is the one you desire, then that's probably the real you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, carefree and unruly, his presence dazzling under the lights. "Diana, I think I get your point now. Just like this year, I've become the person I've always wanted to be. This year has been so fulfilling. I've never had such a full life. And like I said, this year has been incredibly happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil laughed heartily. His skin was a healthy bronze, his carefree laughter giving him a striking, charming appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna suddenly chimed in, "Mr. Farley, are you not afraid of Queenie anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's laughter abruptly stopped. He glanced at Luna and pouted, "Luna, could you not bring up such an unlucky name when we're having a good time? It really messes with my mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna laughed in annoyance, nodding her head. Fine, she wouldn't mention it. She took a large bite of lobster. It was so delicious that she didn't feel like speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group continued eating and chatting, while in the private room across from them sat Steven and Evan, both disguised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan whispered, "Mr. Gellar, what should we do next? How do we head back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He missed Luna and wanted to be with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at him and elegantly ate his steak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reminded him, "You can speak a little louder. They can't hear us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I know you're eager to return and date Luna, but don't just think about what you want. You have to care if she likes you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoped Evan could understand his own heart, not making the same mistakes he had made in the past, going down the wrong path in love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan fell silent. The last comment from Steven left him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been so focused on his own feelings that he forgot to consider whether Luna liked him too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan suddenly spoke with great confidence, "Mr. Gellar, she definitely likes me. If she didn't like me, why would she risk her life to save me? If she didn't like me, why would she worry about me? Also, she wouldn't go looking for me everywhere if she didn't like me, would she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eating paused slightly. He suddenly thought of Diana. He realized that, even though she knew he was fine, she hadn't sought him out, hadn't shown concern for him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he wanted to see her world and walk the path she had walked, but he could never get any closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That thought hit him hard. He understood now what the phrase meant. "The strongest person cannot keep the one they love most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what choice they made, they were always missing out on each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath. "No, it's not too late. It's definitely not too late," he exclaimed inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Diana had loved him desperately. She would carefully prepare his meals three times a day, and during holidays, she would insist on having him accompany her to pray for blessings. But back then, his life was so hard to sustain that he had no interest in doing such childish things with a young girl like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he could try his best to love her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven lowered his head, silently continuing his dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, he elegantly reached for a napkin and wiped his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he asked, "How's the situation with Queenie's acquisition of Zion's agency?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan perked up at the mention of work. "Mr. Gellar, didn't you ask me to secretly stir things up? Well, Queenie only succeeded in acquiring two of the branch companies. The rest were sabotaged by our people. She wants to become a business queen? Let her dream on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew how to paint a big picture for herself, but the cake she was baking, she wouldn't even be able to finish it herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Steven didn't know her true nature, perhaps in one or two years, she could've used his influence to become a real business queen. But now that they all knew her plans, she wouldn't succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wall doesn't have gaps in this world. It was quite satisfying seeing Queenie caught in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also took over a few of the branches, managing them well. Things were going pretty smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, Zion is involved in organ trafficking. This is a death sentence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were filled with murderous intent. "Such a person deserves no mercy. Check his companies, make sure there's nothing dirty going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan replied, "On the surface, the companies seem clean. There are no issues with the accounts either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he handed over a file for Steven to look at. "Mr. Gellar, these two entertainment companies that Queenie acquired are the least reputable ones under Zion's name. On the other hand, the four entertainment companies we've acquired are the top four in the industry. One of them has Levi in their roster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes, calculating his next move. "Terminate Levi's contract. Make sure he disappears from the entertainment circle. At the same time, leak some information to him. Tell him that it's Queenie who wants to blacklist him. Let them tear each other apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was thrilled by the idea. "Great! I love seeing Queenie fail. Her men threw me into the cold sea before. I swore that if I made it out alive, I would make her wish she were never born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought back to the moment he fell into the icy waters, his heart filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm! I'll leave this matter to you," Steven said, looking out the window with deep, thoughtful eyes as he sat in his wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, the long road ahead, that is the path I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Queenie, who had just finished dinner, received a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked Sandra to handle the acquisition of Zion's company, and when she got the call, she was excited. "Sandra, how's it going? Did the acquisition succeed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandra's voice was apologetic. "Sorry, Ms. Marsh. We've only successfully acquired two of the subsidiary companies. The other four subsidiaries were taken by an unknown force. I haven't been able to identify them yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie was shocked. How could someone have beaten her to it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandra continued, "However, the two subsidiaries we've acquired are still quite good. The resources are great. Once all the paperwork is completed, I'll meet with the partners. There are some promising talents in the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie nodded. "Alright! You handle these two companies. Take Felicity's brother with you to work on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the opportunity to warn Sandra. "Sandra, Felicity was once the leader of your group. She was too greedy, and that's why she fell. Now, you're the leader of the team, and you must set a good example. Don't be as greedy as she was. If you do well, I'll raise your annual salary by 500 thousand dollars. Understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loss of Felicity still pained her. Even now, she couldn't let go of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity had always been someone she could rely on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandra's tone was firm and resolute. "Ms. Marsh, don't worry. I won't disappoint you. By the way, Levi's management company is one of the four we missed. What should we do about him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever since the movie was pulled, he's been causing trouble in the company, demanding to see you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="990.html">« Prev</a><a href="992.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
