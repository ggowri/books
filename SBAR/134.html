No wonder Steven doesn't like you. You have been married to him for two years, but you are not even as good as the servants at home. The servants at home are paid at least several thousand dollars, but you do all the household for free. Steven does this just to make you understand your status. In his heart, you are not even as good as a servant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie interpreted Steven's meaning in her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew that Steven didn't treat her as a human being, but when Queenie analyzed the matter, she was still heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She bit her lower lip gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia knew that Diana was still hurt by Queenie's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia looked at Steven angrily and said, "Steven, you are shameless, you have a mistress and even allow the mistress to bully your wife. You treat Diana as a pawn and even want to hurt her again..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Olivia, stop talking, let's go." Diana's voice was hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stood in front of Diana again, looking down at her painful face. He clenched his fists and said, "Diana, I apologize for what happened in the past. I was wrong. I have already stopped Queenie's card and will not have anything to do with her anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was concise and explained things clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned and mocked him, "I am a decent girl, would I want a man who Queenie has slept with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was slightly stunned, and his tone was filled with anger, "Diana, do you believe those photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana found it funny and said, "Steven, you and Queenie are indeed the same kind of people. You dare to do things but not to take responsibility. Could the video of the two of you lying in bed and having sex crazily be fake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You can take those videos and authenticate them. They are real."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had also seen those videos and photos, and the videos were not synthesized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The people in the video were him and Queenie, but he had never touched Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their most intimate action was he holding her and going to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Get out of the way, don't disgust me. Also, get a divorce quickly, I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana took Olivia and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Queenie saw Diana leaving, she walked up to Steven crying and complained to him, "Steven, I didn't expect that Diana would hate me so much and would slander me for everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, Steven, I was the one who saved you back then, why did you suspend my card?" Queenie mentioned that she had saved his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew clearly that Steven cared about this matter the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked gloomy and said, "For you saving my life back then, I have given you several billion dollars over the years, and I have already repaid you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I won't give you money anymore. My wife misunderstood you as my mistress. For the sake of your reputation, you should ask your brother for money in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, even so, Diana didn't say anything. Instead, you are the one who provokes her every day. It's clear who is framing whom, Queenie. When you treated me like a fool, you should have thought that your life-saving grace would eventually run out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven left after he finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was only left with a tall and indifferent back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie stood there blankly, at a loss as to what to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven said that he would never give her money to spend again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, with the money given by Steven in recent years, she set up her own company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was no longer of any use to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't believe the video she showed him last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Damn it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she would not let Steven go like this.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="133.html">« Prev</a><a href="135.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
