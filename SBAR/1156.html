Racing costs a lot, and I think you're well aware of that. Your two brothers have achieved nothing and almost lost their lives because of racing. If it weren't for you stepping in, Eric would have been dead by now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the end, he ended up as just a driver for others."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana helplessly thought, "How does racing become a waste of ambition? Only capable people can play it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Exactly, a thrilling life like that is something someone like you will never experience in your lifetime. That's the biggest difference between you and Elroy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Elroy is willing to admit defeat, but your approach is outright robbery."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner was very upset, but compared to reputation, he cared more about money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner arrogantly said, "Ms. Bishop, you must give me an explanation for today's matter, or you won't be allowed to start work."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at him angrily, wanting to hit him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To meticulously plan this resort, Nolan stayed up late almost every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner wanted to steal such hard-earned results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I'm not easy to bully."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana punched Tanner in the face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt much better now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner's face was swollen, and he was very angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly grabbed her hand and said, "If you want to hit someone, just tell me, I'll do it. If you hurt your hand, it hurts my heart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's the one in pain!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought they were really shameless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey! Mr. Gellar, I'm the one in pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked, "Oh! Does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner replied, "It hurts a lot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sneered and said, "What does that have to do with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "Weren't you the one who asked me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Either leave or show me the evidence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner was furious, feeling they were simply too bullying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, Diana, you're too much. With my status, you can't just hit me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner had never been hit by anyone since childhood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, he was hit by a woman and felt utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled mischievously at him and said, "Why? If you like getting hit, I can give you another slap."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "You..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought Diana was acting recklessly, relying on Steven to protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, do you think you can do whatever you want just because of Steven? I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Wait, Elroy is calling me. Let me take this call first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana answered the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said, "Ms. Bishop, I was just in a match and missed your call. What's up? Do you want to help me with the match?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I can help you with a match. But I have a bit of a problem here. Do you remember the land you sold me? Now Tanner has come to me, claiming it's his and even showed evidence. The Morrison family really has no integrity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said, "Are you talking about Tanner? What does he have to do with my family? Even though we share the same last name, you can't insult my family like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have nothing to do with that idiot."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Tanner and smiled even more happily. "Not bad, he says the land is his."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said casually, "Oh! So that's how it is. The land is mine, and I sold it to you. That idiot doesn't know we recorded a video during the signing, does he?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I told him, but he doesn't believe it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said, "No problem. Just kick him out. He dares to say the land is his, what evidence does he have?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Make him go away! Four days later, help me with a match. I'll send you the address."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana readily agreed, "Sure! Just sign me up. I don't need a navigator, just send me the race map."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said happily, "That's great, Diana. Tanner should be by your side."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, "Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said, "Tanner, even though I'm not in the U.S., I can still get news from there. You've been meeting Mario frequently lately, thinking you can get back billions of dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you thinking? Impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed and said, "Mr. Morrison, I'm afraid this matter won't be so easy to resolve. Mr. Tanner Morrison came with all the documents."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't be as foolish as him. Can the evidence he has withstand investigation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These documents were all given to him by Queenie, and now this land is his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Tanner across from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes avoided hers, not daring to look at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana understood. "Fine! I've already called the police. If they stole anything, they'll definitely go to jail."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said, "That's right, I'll have my lawyer send our contract and the videos to the police station."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Goodbye."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy finished speaking and hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner clenched the documents in his hand, feeling lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Should I take a gamble?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what if I lose?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I don't want to go to jail."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner forgot to tell Elroy that this land would be very profitable in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "No, I need to call that idiot. I need to tell him this land will be very profitable in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and stated a fact that scared him. "This land will indeed be very profitable after development. I'll give him 2% equity shares since he sold me the land, and that's how I can make money."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's not the only one who knows how to use money to win people over; she does too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy only cares about racing. He knows nothing about running a business.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, her plan is more convincing to Elroy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1155.html">« Prev</a><a href="1157.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
