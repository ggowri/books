Though it hadn't snowed tonight, the wind was fierce, intensifying her irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven clearly didn't prioritize her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't even answer her calls.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should she do?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could her plan still be implemented?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't turn to Levi or Jace for help&mdash;there was no way she could reveal her pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pregnant person could only be Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how should she set Diana up?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How should she get Diana's passport?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt utterly lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pregnancy couldn't have come at a worse time; she needed to terminate it discreetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could she convince Diana that Steven was the father?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A whirlwind of chaotic thoughts raced through Queenie's mind, and she paced back and forth, unable to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since learning of her pregnancy, she had felt increasingly unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering, she picked up her phone and called Levi.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Queenie, do you miss me?" Levi teased with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie lowered her voice, saying, "Levi, I'm pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi was horrified. "What? How could you be pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold fury flashed in her eyes at his disbelief. "Levi, what's with that tone? I said I'm pregnant&mdash;with your child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible. I used protection every time. How could this happen?" Levi protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "But I've only slept with you these past few months. The baby is yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember our first time? You were in a hurry and didn't use protection. Did you forget?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie needed to gauge his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't admit it, she had plenty of ways to deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, framing Diana felt like a dangerous gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Diana got angry, she might spill everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And while Elsie had run off, Paige still had proof of Queenie and Elsie's scheming against Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi sounded anxious now. "Queenie, our careers are taking off. If word gets out that you're pregnant with my child, it'll ruin us both. We've got this drama to finish filming, and it'll take another month.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you have an abortion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi had usually been cautious when it came to his sexual encounters. Despite having slept with numerous women in the past, he always made sure to use birth control. However, that night, feeling impatient, he had unprotected sex twice in the bathroom and twice on the windowsill. Fueled by some wine and a desire for excitement, he forgot to use protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie tightened her grip on the phone, anger coursing through her. She closed her eyes, overwhelmed by the pain. Why couldn't she find someone who truly cared about her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had once genuinely cared. If she hadn't walked away after his accident and had stayed with him, maybe he would still be the one treating her with sincerity now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more sorrowful she felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's meet tomorrow to talk," she said finally. "I'm really pregnant with your child. If you don't believe me, I'll have to carry it to term and do a paternity test."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'll get in touch tomorrow around noon. We have a shoot then, and let's find a quiet place to discuss this," Levi agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Queenie replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, she received a call from Mario.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Mario. How's the investigation going?" she asked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="634.html">« Prev</a><a href="636.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
