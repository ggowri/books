You've fulfilled your grandfather's agreement, and the operating rights are now in your hands. There's no need to keep Diana tied to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was surprised, gazing at Helen's kind face. She hadn't expected Helen to bring this up so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned. Helen had always forbidden him from divorcing Diana. Why was she agreeing now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, this is between Diana and me," he said in a deep tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen was puzzled by him. He used to look down on Diana, but now he was reluctant to divorce her. Helen said, "But you don't love Diana. I've heard that Alexander has a crush on Diana, and he seems like a good man. Let Diana go find her love. I've secretly seen Alexander. At least he won't abandon Diana, nor will he side with outsiders when she's bullied. He'll stand by her, unlike you, who's obsessed with Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned but said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana listened to Helen, feeling grateful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recalling how Steven always took Queenie's side whenever she was framed, she felt heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in this new life, the pain was still deeply etched in her heart, impossible to erase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stared intensely at Diana, thinking, "Do you also like Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had seen her laughing happily with Alexander during dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But was her love for him that shallow? Could she have fallen for someone else so quickly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said to Diana in a deep voice, "Let's have dinner first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana helped Helen to dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Edward had been abroad recently and hadn't returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen's health had indeed been poor lately. She only managed a little soup before she couldn't eat anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew about her stomach issues. After Zora brought the medicine, she took out two pills and handed them to Helen. "Helen, take your medicine first, and then get some sleep. You'll feel much better tomorrow. I'll treat you, and your stomachache will be gone soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen's eyes brightened instantly. "Diana, are you not leaving tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Helen, I'll stay here to treat you tonight. I won't leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's wonderful, Diana. It's been a long time since anyone has kept me company and chatted with me. We will have a good talk tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked Luna to bring her the medical kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forty minutes later, Luna arrived with the medical kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana went to Helen's room to treat her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zora immediately went to the garden to call Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Marsh, that bitch has come to see Madam Gellar again. Madam Gellar even said that Mr. Gellar should divorce Diana, but he can't marry you. Ms. Marsh, Madam Gellar is the biggest obstacle for you to get the Gellar family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zora said this while vigilantly looking around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was furious. Helen was indeed the biggest obstacle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Zora, keep an eye on Steven and Diana. We can't let Steven and Diana share a room. As for your son's job, I'll arrange it later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zora was delighted, but she had some difficulties. "Ms. Marsh, they are a couple. I have no reason to prevent them from staying in the same room, but I know Mr. Gellar loves you. He won't stay in the same room with Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sneered, "Keep an eye on her. I'm afraid Diana will seduce Steven shamelessly."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="418.html">« Prev</a><a href="420.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
