"I should have known! Strangers can't compare to your own flesh and blood. When it comes down to it, I have to turn to my real daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of anger flashed in Queenie's eyes, but she said nothing as she looked at Paula's pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I raised you. For you, I sent my own daughter away and cut all ties with her. Now, after severing that bond, how can I possibly ask her for money? Even if I had no shame, how could I beg her to pay off these billions? I never raised her&mdash;not for a single day&mdash;you're the one I raised. Are you saying that the grace of birth greater than the grace of rearing? You really know how to irritate me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were the one who staged a kidnapping to frame Diana, and I was furious. To spare your feelings, I refused even to acknowledge her as my daughter. I went that far for you, and now you expect me to find her and ask for help? Where would I even find the face to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was visibly upset, her eyes blazing as she glared at the heartless Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising a dog would've been more rewarding than raising her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, the woman before her was worse than an animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff quickly comforted her. "Paula, don't cry. If you can't ask her, I'll go. I'm her father. I can swallow my pride if it helps. Alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How ridiculous! The money belongs to her brother, not to her! The project just started; how could she have the money herself? And I need everything paid back by the 10th of next month. By then, I'll reclaim all the assets given to you and sell everything off to cover the loans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff grew panicked, shouting. "That's impossible! Without the company, how am I supposed to survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face contorted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The love between them was buried beneath the crushing burden of one billion in debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you cursed jinx! You've ruined us! Your company is ruined, and now you want to steal my son's? I always told you a woman's place is at home, supporting her family. But you just had to go out there and flaunt yourself, and look what's happened! Now you've lost the company, racked up all this debt, and expect my son to pay it off? Dream on! Get out of my house! You're bankrupt now; don't even think of leeching off my son. You really think he's going to pay off one billion for you? Are you delusional?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey sobbed and wailed. She thought to herself, "What's going to happen to me in my old age? How could we be bankrupt just like that? Paula's spoiled us all these years, and if we lose everything, we won't survive&mdash;this will be the death of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tracey, how can you say that? I give you so much money every month. Why are you blaming me now? Business has its ups and downs; this failure wasn't my fault! Someone is sabotaging us in secret&mdash;I didn't see this coming either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's the dirty dog, scheming against me in the shadows? If I find out who it is, I'll curse their whole family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of anger flashed in Queenie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula caught it and felt a grim satisfaction. Just wait&mdash;she was going to drag Queenie'a family down to hell with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned and snapped at Tracey, "Tracey, do you think I wanted this bankruptcy? I wanted to run the company well and let everyone live comfortably. But the company's gone now&mdash;what's the point of blaming me? Can't we focus on paying off the debts first?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="552.html">« Prev</a><a href="554.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
