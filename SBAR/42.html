"Tell Mr. James I'm willing to give up one percent of the profits, and I appreciate his trust." Diana relayed Steven's message to Henry, who was delighted. After both parties signed the contract, Alexander arranged for Henry to be sent back to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, however, looked at Diana with concern. Observing how Queenie and Steven treated her, he suspected Diana might have had a hard time in the Marsh family. Queenie was known as the Marsh family's princess and had grown up with Steven. No matter what Queenie did wrong, Steven was always tolerant of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Henry was sent away, Alexander smiled and thanked Diana. "Diana, thanks to you, the partnership ended smoothly. Let me take you to dinner, and I'll make sure you get home afterward."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, having translated for four hours, was tired and sleepy. She nodded, her eyes sincere and charming. "Mr. Powell, could I have some steak? I'm really hungry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was captivated by her large, bright eyes and couldn't help but smile. "I'll get you a double portion."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you!" Diana replied happily, her every move lively and charming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie watched, surprised by Diana's transformation. "Where's the dull and boring Diana I used to know?" she thought. "Is she copying me now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you didn't act like this before. You're just a copycat, and that's embarrassing. Be careful in front of Mr. Powell," Queenie said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, tired of Queenie's noise, was speechless. "Does Queenie always have to flaunt herself?" she thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm just being myself. Am I a copycat? Did I learn from you? Are you as brilliant or as pretty as me? What have I possibly copied from you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was infuriated and looked at Steven with grievance. "Steven, look, Diana bullies me like this all the time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Queenie's act, Diana felt only disgust. "Did I bully you? Queenie, do you believe in retribution? What you did to me before will come back to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was stunned, unaccustomed to Diana's defensiveness. Diana looked at Steven. "I've done what you asked, but you and Queenie don't need to keep bullying me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, reflecting on his past wrongs against her. "Diana, I wronged you before, and it was us..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana interrupted with a sneer, "Don't apologize, Steven. You can't repay what you owe me with an apology."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes darkened. "Diana, do you have to make a scene like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What scene? Are you blind or deaf? Queenie set me up, yet you all blamed me. Get out of here, or I'll lose my temper!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was fed up and ready to stand up for herself. Steven was also angry, his gaze cold. "Diana, you're just vulgar."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed. "Yes, I'm vulgar. Queenie is the gentle one, right? Why do you all have to trouble me? I helped you tonight, didn't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Alexander. "Mr. Powell, let's go. Don't bother with them. I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, surprised by Diana's eloquence, shrugged and led her to dinner without a backward glance at Steven or Queenie. Queenie trembled with anger, realizing Diana was no longer a pushover.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Steven watched them leave, he suppressed his anger. Queenie, worried, asked, "Steven, Diana's always been like this. Why haven't you divorced her yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her deeply. "Why?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was stunned. "Steven, what?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her, suspicion in his eyes. "Why did you set Diana up?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="41.html">« Prev</a><a href="43.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
