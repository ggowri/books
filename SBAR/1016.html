"Cecil, this looks just like your death. Pretty brutal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil stared at her, his voice failing him as the weight of his past flashed before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tremor ran through him, as if he could feel the pain all over again. His whole body ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't you think it's odd? Why did Queenie's brother die the same way I did?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recalled the news she'd read earlier&mdash;Amelie had been committed to a psychiatric hospital by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had become partially paralyzed. These were things that had happened to Paula in her last life, but now they were playing out with Queenie's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered if Queenie's parents would react the same way Paula had, breaking down from grief after their son's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her voice, deep in thought. "Cecil, do you think it's possible that all the misfortune we faced in the past life is coming back to haunt Queenie's loved ones? After all, we were the ones who died the most unjustly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil stole a glance at her. Wasn't that the truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been a fool, dying just like that. The Farley family had lost everything to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was nothing more than a stepping stone for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil let out a hollow laugh, his voice dropping low. "Diana, so you're saying I've dodged a bullet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. Mystical stuff like that wasn't her thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow and grinned, "Cecil, why don't you ask Olivia? She's the one who can see your fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil thought of Olivia, a playful gleam in his eyes. "Alright, I'll go see her tonight. But you know, she charges a fortune for that stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana warned him, "Cecil, Queenie is a master of patience. Now that her parents are in trouble, nothing can threaten her directly. What happens next? It's anyone's guess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil understood her point, his tall frame leaning casually against Diana's desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't you have a plan for the next move?" He was curious. What did she have in mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Jeff and Amelie in their current state, Queenie was still standing strong. Diana wouldn't feel she'd avenged herself until that changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes flickered. What was her plan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought briefly of the altered paternity test. Then, out of nowhere, a question popped into her head&mdash;who was her biological father?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled softly, her tone thoughtful. "I have a plan, but it depends on what Queenie decides to do next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark thought crept into Cecil's mind. "Diana, I have a feeling that Queenie's completely cut ties with her family. She might be about to go full villain mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like those TV shows, you know? The heroine suffers for so long that when she finally snaps, she's unstoppable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed, her eyes sparkling. "Cecil, are you talking about me? Look at what I've been through. How many times has that little mistress, Queenie, rubbed it in my face? Every day, sending me screenshots, with pictures and everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She thought she could outsmart me. But behind the scenes, she was running a business while scheming against me. Then I made my move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Life's about progression, not stagnation. I took a three-year break, but some people still thought I was just a country girl with nothing to offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's not me. While I rested, I kept working. I've always known you can't be content with the status quo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, on the other hand, just keeps wanting more. Greedy. If she succeeds, she'll shoot to the top. If she fails, she's done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's passion surged as she spoke, her anger clear in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil chuckled, clearly impressed by her fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He agreed with everything she said. "Life's about standing tall and taking responsibility for your future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swept his gaze over her luxurious office before speaking, "Diana, just look at this place. You've really made it. If anyone deserves a new start, it's you, not Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She and Steven did all the hard work, and now they're letting you have the spotlight. They've faded into the background, letting you shine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was sure of it&mdash;Diana would be the ultimate winner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes, then smiled at him. "Cecil, do you think I'm just sitting back and enjoying the spoils? There's no such thing as a free lunch. It's all traps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What seemed like an easy win to everyone else was a trap Diana knew all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she often found herself staring at her divorce papers, wondering if she'd really gone through with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven Gellar was still alive. That was the trap he'd set for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't ready to make a move yet&mdash;he was biding his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was investigating Andrew and the guy behind it all, gathering all the intel he needed. Once he had it all, he'd strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, Steven would trap Queenie and the mysterious guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Cecil could ask more questions, Diana smiled and interrupted, "Cecil, no need to ask anything else. We just need to wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wait for Steven to deal with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had always been cautious. How could she trust that Steven and Evan were truly dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil narrowed his eyes, his gaze full of calculation. Queenie had plotted against him too many times&mdash;now it was his turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed Diana a fancy lollipop. "Diana, have one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the candy and smiled, opening it up to reveal a rich, chocolatey treat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil leaned in, his voice low and teasing. "Diana, tonight I'm waiting for you to watch the show. I'll call you this afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been caught in Queenie's schemes too many times. It was time to get some revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked, intrigued, "What show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's eyes gleamed with mischief as he smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, tonight the Farley family is hosting a big event. You've got to come. I'm inviting Queenie too, along with Owen and Yanson. Those bastards didn't treat you kindly before, but tonight, I'll show them who you really are. You, Diana Bishop, are the VIP of the Farley family now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana studied his confident expression, a tiny hint of concern crossing her mind. She hoped his "show" didn't end up being a spectacle for others at his expense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana kept her thoughts to herself, but she knew Cecil wasn't one to sit idly by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded slightly. "Alright! Just send me the address this afternoon. I'll have Luna take me there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's face lit up with a big grin. "OK!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil happily took the lollipop from Diana's hand, unwrapping it with a smile. "Diana, this is really sweet, smells great. It's delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a special lollipop, imported from overseas just for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He playfully brought the candy close to her lips, his voice soft and warm. "Diana, try it. Isn't it good?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1015.html">« Prev</a><a href="1017.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
