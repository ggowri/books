"</span><span>Well</span><span>, I know I can't convince Dylan. We both know how much he cares for Queenie. These past few years, he's been living abroad. To him, divorce or affairs between couples are just normal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie </span><span>is related to him</span><span>. He probably won't listen me. He's too stubborn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But can I just stand by?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought he was already foolish enough, but Dylan was even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula felt helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice carried a hint of disappointment. "You don't need to worry about Dylan. </span><span>W</span><span>orry about yourself. By now, Queenie probably knows you're managing the company. She'll definitely use Dylan to scheme against you. </span><span>S</span><span>tay alert."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told Queenie on purpose that all my assets are still intact, just to lure her into making a move. This time, I&rsquo;ll make sure she can never start over or hurt any of you again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric felt a deep pain. "Because of Queenie, our family fell apart, and Diana left us too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I'm still grateful. Thanks to Diana, at least we're all alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's hands, resting on her knees, trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only now did she realize how good Diana had been. Her impulsiveness and wrong choices had cost her Diana forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she smiled and said, "This lesson, in a way, is a good thing. At least you two have come to your senses. You'll achieve something in the future, and I won't have to worry about you anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, you need to focus on recovering now. Eric, I'll secretly help you manage the company. I've already sent your grandparents to a safe place. </span><span>We</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll have</span><span> a tough battle. You both need to be ready."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale and Eric nodded quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale smiled and said, "I've been learning all along. But, Althea..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop thinking about her. Your son has nothing to do with you. During this time, Althea met someone she truly likes. She loved you for so many years, but you broke her heart. Staying out of her life is the best."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula thought it was such a shame because Gale would never find a wife as good as that again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had watched Althea grow up. Althea truly was a good girl.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sighed, "Frank is such a fool too. Paige is such a wonderful girl, but he doesn't care. You two will never find girls who love you like they did again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your wealthy background makes you confident and arrogant, that's why you hurt a girl like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Paula thought about it, the more she felt like a failure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn&rsquo;t understand what she had been thinking before, or how she ever believed Diana would embarrass her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, everything she was going through must be karma, right?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric knew Paula was the most upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spoke softly, "I know you're hurting, but what's done is done. Don't dwell on it. From now on, we'll work together to make the company stronger. No one will dare to mess with us again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He understood something now. "</span><span>W</span><span>e need to become so powerful that no one can surpass us. We have to make the rules. Our existence should intimidate the weak and inspire the strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale instantly laughed, "Isn't that Steven? But he's already on the same side as Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at Gale and Eric, saying, "Alright, stop overthinking. Queenie will use Dylan to steal company secrets. Let's set a trap for Dylan, then hand him over to the police. That way, we can keep him safe for now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if that idiot ends up with a record, it's the only path left."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric chuckled, "Leaving him with a record and letting him live&mdash;he's already lucky."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Paula, Gale, and Eric fell into silence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven also got the news that Dylan was back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan had been secretly watching them. He even recorded videos and sent them to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, look at this. That's Dylan. If he doesn't die, I won't be able to calm my anger. How can</span><span> he</span><span> be this stupid?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie</span><span> made their mess</span><span>, yet he's still helping her. Is he stupid or what?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This had nothing to do with Evan, yet he was trembling with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After watching the video, Steven felt a pang in his chest at the sight of Diana's sorrowful expression. This wasn&rsquo;t her fault, yet everyone was blaming her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan kept calling her a bastard child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What an asshole!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied, "</span><span>D</span><span>efinitely an idiot. But he</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s </span><span>just Queenie&rsquo;s stepping stone. He&rsquo;s as good as dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, the Mysterium Organization is on this island. Andrew left today. Our people followed him all the way until he returned. This time, he brought four people. Here&rsquo;s the video."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes and took Evan's phone to watch the video.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the video, Andrew was holding a strange-looking box, with four men following closely behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven forwarded the video to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Diana, Andrew left the island.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just last night that Steven finally learned Diana's true identity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was Leopold's granddaughter and the CEO of Azure Group. The wealth of Azure Group was immeasurable. No wonder she didn&rsquo;t want any property back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she wouldn&rsquo;t even care about the little money he offered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold's identity was even more mysterious. Steven only knew his name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still hadn&rsquo;t figured out what other identities Leopold might have.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key was, Leopold knew Edward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward had always insisted that Steven marry Diana, which now made perfect sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward had always known her identity and she was a good girl. That&rsquo;s why he used those terms to force Steven to marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was grateful she was still his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Diana just got home. She went to her room alone. Dylan&rsquo;s situation left her feeling upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sat on the edge of the bed, feeling miserable. His words had cut too deep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was determined to find her father and learn who he was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's phone buzzed softly. She picked it up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had blocked Steven's number before, so now he was texting her from a new one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Andrew in the video, she grew curious about what he was holding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whatever was in that box, it wasn&rsquo;t ordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt something was off. With a box like that, Andrew would never get past security. She quickly called Steven.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1039.html">« Prev</a><a href="1041.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
