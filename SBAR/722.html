I wanted to warn you that night. I was worried something would happen to you, but I couldn't find you afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But hey, you're lucky. You met me. Your life is safe now, and the frostbite on your skin will heal with time. You have to wake up soon. Life only has meaning if you're alive. You can only get revenge if you're alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Foliot, if you can hear my words, you have to wake up. Before you get revenge, you can't just leave like this. Don't let those who wronged you and bullied you off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just about revenge. It's about your family too. Think about your mom and dad. They wouldn't want to see you lying here like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana held Lily's frostbitten hand, which had turned black but was now covered in healing ointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the layer of dead tissue fell off, her hand would return to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew she must have felt helpless and in agony at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had crawled out on her hands and knees, only scrambling towards Diana's car when she spotted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must have been desperate to live despite her severe injuries, fighting with everything she had to find help.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stayed with Lily and talked to her for a long time. After about twenty minutes, she saw Lily's fingers twitch and tears welling up in the corners of her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was thrilled. She quickly checked Lily's pulse, and it was normal. "As long as I come and chat with her every day," she thought, "she should wake up soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, Diana stood up and gave Lily a thorough check-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confirming that Lily was out of danger, she happily stood by the bed and said, "Mrs. Foliot, I'll come back tomorrow to chat with you some more. You need to wake up soon. They're trying to pin your death on me. When you wake up, we'll fight these monsters together."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's fingers twitched again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana saw it and left with a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then headed to Tom's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom set aside his work when he saw her cheerful return, his smile warm and gentle. "Diana, judging by that expression, I take it there's good news about Lily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded excitedly. "Tom, I just had a chat with Mrs. Foliot. She was crying, but her will to live is so strong. She'll wake up soon, and when she does, I'll show all those doubters how wrong they were."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her mood soured when she thought about her daughter's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie had thoroughly infiltrated Jean's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean only had eyes and thoughts for Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Amelie was doing was destroying Jean, yet she saw it as love.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana worried that Lily would be heartbroken to learn Jean only cared about Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain of knowing her biological daughter only cared for her adopted mother was absolutely gut-wrenching.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom noticed her mood dropping and walked over to hand her a cup of warm milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't care much for other drinks, but she loved her warm milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took the cup, happily taking a sip. "Tom, this is so comforting. I should get going now, don't want to keep you from your work."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom furrowed his brows as he watched her, disappointed this little troublemaker didn't have lunch with him. "You're not going to stay and have dinner with me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="721.html">« Prev</a><a href="723.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
