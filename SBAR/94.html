"Diana, I'll remind you one more time that you're still my wife."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His sexy and low voice held a sharp indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was about to break down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had thrown the divorce papers in front of her earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She insisted that she didn't want a divorce, but all she got in return was worse pain from him and Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now Steven pestered her with the fact that they didn't have a divorce.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I'm not going to argue with you about this anymore. I've signed the divorce papers, and I'm divorced from you. We've talked about this for a long time, and I don't want to talk about it again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I only recognize the divorce papers I signed, and I'm never going back to the Gellar family, much less the Marsh family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why couldn't Steven understand that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did he always think she was playing tricks?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hadn't she been clear during these days?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, Mr. Gellar, I have my own private life. Please don't bother me every day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was helpless, and he seemed to have told her that a couple of times before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Queenie wasn't feeling well and wanted him to stay with her. He was unavailable, working day and night, and Diana asked him to come home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had yelled at Diana like that when he met her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Diana said something like that, but he felt an inexplicable burn of anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that she was serious, Steven's eyes were filled with an anger that would be impossible to extinguish. "Diana, my patience is limited."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had loved him for years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was used to her meticulous care.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Diana had suddenly given up loving him, it made him uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, my patience is also limited. Diana treated you as her husband before, but now that you are divorced, you should get as far away as you can. The woman you love is Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias couldn't help but snarl, feeling that Steven was just bullying Diana because there was no one to protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Steven indifferently, looking arrogant and overbearing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pursed his lips tightly as he saw what the two had just done.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They acted that way because they were close.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Diana have known each other for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two also had a tacit understanding, which gave Steven a sense of crisis.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you?" Steven's sexy voice was filled with indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for Tobias to speak, Diana said, "</span><span>He's</span><span> my family. Mr. Gellar, please leave him alone. I won't fight with you for Queenie, and I won't bother you every day anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I used to be insensitive to argue with Queenie all the time. Didn't you always think I was annoying and vicious? I'm really like that, and a bumpkin from the country doesn't deserve you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana..." Steven frowned, not realizing that she would belittle herself like that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly remembered that Queenie would belittle Diana this way whenever she caused trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana calmly stated, "Mr. Gellar, for the past year, you've used the most vicious methods to humiliate me. Isn't that enough? Let's end it here. I truly won't bother you again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She began shedding tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought her heart wouldn't ache anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the past still hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned deeply, realizing he had indeed gone too far before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, when she retaliated, Queenie's true face gradually emerged. Who is the liar on earth?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood up and said, "Tobias, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias shot Steven a cold glare before leaving with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat quietly, his distinguished figure resembling a statue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Evan rushed in, "Mr. Gellar, the Chairman has returned."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold glint flashed in Steven's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where is he?" he asked coldly, his voice suppressed and intimidating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said softly, "He's already back at home and asks to see you now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="93.html">« Prev</a><a href="95.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
