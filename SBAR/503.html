Last night, Jeff and Amelie had been entangled in their usual games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff remained oblivious to the years of betrayal by the woman he kept on the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women like Amelie, who lived off men, had no sense of shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Jeff not always around, she must have had dated other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was attractive, slightly plump yet elegant. She navigated a world of men, using her beauty and wiles to her advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda gazed disdainfully at the scene not far off. "She's young and could've done anything, but she lacks self-respect, flitting between men just to live well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula struggled to accept such a life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Linda, people make different choices. You, for instance, would rather shine in your career than be a housewife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda smiled, "I've always been more clear-headed than you. Our husband's mothers are cut from the same cloth, thinking women should stay home, tending to husbands and children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when the chips are down and there's no money in the family pot, suddenly, they'll say we've contributed nothing. They'll just see us lounging around at home, not bringing in a dime. They think I'm living off her son's earnings, spending his money, and in their eyes, everything I do is just wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse to be treated like that. I earn my own money and spend it how I please. I buy what I want and get gifts for my family. No one dares say a word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her deepest regret was not marrying into a kind family or finding a good man to share her life with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Paula, chuckling. "I'm lucky to have a great boss. You've let me earn millions of dollars a year. I'm so confident now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula realized that a woman's confidence should stem from her own ability to earn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled bitterly, "My parents agreed to my marriage with Jeff on the condition I signed a promise not to hand over the company while they lived. They saw through him and thought him unreliable; that's why they had me sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness I was set on running my own company, so I didn't let him get his hands on it that easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paula finished, the door to a nearby room was kicked in by Lily and her friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's screams pierced the air immediately after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's friends rushed in, beating Amelie again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Amelie's wait for Jeff to come to her rescue was all for nothing, leaving her to become the talk of the town, branded as Mark's mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana and Nolan wrapped up work, they saw the trending news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Discovering the woman was Jeff's mistress, Queenie's mother, and now Mark's mistress, Diana was stunned. Amelie was quite the player.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder she'd been at Jace's banquet, giving Paula a show that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She had it coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was wicked and deserved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people were just born with malice in their hearts. In her previous life, Paula was driven to the brink of insanity, all thanks to Amelie's machinations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Paula knew the truth but stayed sane, changing the course of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat on the sofa, sipping the coffee Luna had made, scrolling through comments on her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comment section was a barrage of curses aimed at Amelie, offering nothing worth reading. Diana chuckled. It seemed the spectacle unfolding at the Foliot family was quite the entertaining drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was engrossed when an unfamiliar number called.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="502.html">« Prev</a><a href="504.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
