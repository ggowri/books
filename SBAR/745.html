Now, he realized that feeling was long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clasped his hands lightly on his knees and watched as she kept glancing at her phone, his brow furrowing gradually. "Diana, could you put the phone down for a bit? You'll let the food get cold."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of his slightly reproachful tone, Diana looked up, puzzled. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pressed his lips together, his voice low. "Just finish your meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." Diana quickly finished the rest of her food and got up to wash the dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no intention of having a conversation with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her distant, indifferent expression as she worked in the kitchen, Steven felt a pang of frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, he headed upstairs to prepare for a meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Work had kept him swamped lately, and he was exhausted from the seemingly endless issues piling up at the company. It was when he returned home that he could feel any sense of ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana finished washing up, she saw that Steven had left and returned to her room to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, she'd been going over the guidelines for an upcoming design competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just an ordinary contest but winning would still be good.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After careful thought, Diana decided to let Queenie be in the spotlight this time. She knew she needed to focus on the threats lurking in the shadows; now wasn't the time for her to step out into the open.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in her room, Diana didn't start sketching designs as usual; instead, she turned her attention to the stock market.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had she opened her laptop than a call came from Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it's rising! Our stock's been climbing like crazy. It's incredible! We bought it just before it hit rock bottom, and now it's just going up and up. You're a genius."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled. Luckily, her memory had served her well; otherwise, they would've missed this chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the top names in the stock market would have seen this stock's surge coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew that in three days, it would plummet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, make sure you sell everything once it peaks."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? It's been doing so well, almost skyrocketing. Why sell now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. "Trust me. Rapid rises come with rapid falls. It's just how the market works. We can't get greedy."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil replied, "Alright, alright, I'll listen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Good. Talk soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!" Cecil's voice was full of cheer as she ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana continued to stare at the stock charts, her mind wandering back to Steven and his sudden offer to help with dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't make sense of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't the Steven she knew; the Steven she remembered would never show such a gentle expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After puzzling over it at her desk for a while, she decided to let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was certain that Steven's mind was full of nothing but business, with no room for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was idle tonight, her thoughts drifted aimlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shut her laptop and began to organize her wardrobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these clothes had been chosen by Steven, and the fabrics were luxuriously comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their relationship hadn't yet reached the point of no return.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much was different from her previous life. With things so off-course, her fate would surely change as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, they wouldn't have a child, and those later events wouldn't happen. With that in mind, she thought, "Maybe it's best to coexist peacefully with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Letting resentment cloud your mind is irrational," she reminded herself. "It comes at a cost, one that I don't need to pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought firmly in mind, she put her energy into tidying up her room.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="744.html">« Prev</a><a href="746.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
