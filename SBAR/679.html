Steven still had his back to Queenie. But his expression was extremely cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned, thinking, "How could I know why she doesn't like me?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenny is unhappy every time she sees me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only met Diana once, but she liked Diana at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I poisoned Jenny. She went crazy and was finally sent to a mental hospital by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven deserves to die, and Andrew dislikes him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the time is not right now. Steven must protect me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie found an excuse to evade Steven. "Steven, maybe Diana said something bad about me in front of your mother. After all, at that time, everyone thought I was just the wrong daughter. She thought I was not the real daughter of the Marsh family and looked down on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly turned to look at her. His eyes were deep and difficult to understand. "Queenie, you have been getting one thing wrong. What my mother cares about is that Diana is the daughter born from Ms. Barnes' belly. The Marsh family is nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes were filled with shock. Humiliation overwhelmed her like a flood.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, do you look down on me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie then turned around and left angrily. Steven's words touched her sore spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her leave. He picked up his phone and called Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had already rescued Lily. She was just about to go back. Just as she got in the car, she received a call from Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Diana was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes became gloomy slightly. "Where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going home."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "I'll go home for lunch. I want to eat pumpkin soup."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana retorted, "Steven, I'm just going to change my clothes. I have to go to work then. I don't have time to make soup for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have lunch and go back then. I'll have someone send the ingredients over."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Steven hung up the phone, not giving Diana any chance to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless. She thought, "What a bastard!" She punched the steering wheel and drove home to cook.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Tobias, she compromised. She thought, "As long as Tobias could become more potent, he would defeat Steven one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is a long-time battle." With that thought, Diana calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one o'clock in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven returned home, and Diana had already prepared lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven saw Diana in the kitchen. A hint of warmth appeared in his eyes. He went to wash his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana saw him coming back and prepared to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat and waited for Steven. Then, Cecil called her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was drinking soup and turned on the speakerphone. "Hi, Cecil."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I have a question that I can't figure out. You have a very high IQ, normal thinking, calmness, and understanding. What exactly do you like about Steven? Is it his stupid brain or his stubborn temper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt someone behind her. She suddenly looked back at Steven, who had a gloomy face.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="678.html">« Prev</a><a href="680.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
