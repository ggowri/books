He leaned closer, whispering, "It's Frank. He owns that entertainment company everyone's talking about. He just got back the day before yesterday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned. "Has Frank been insane? Hiring paparazzi to smear his own sister?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A snort of laughter escaped Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you just as guilty? You helped the Marsh family smear Ms. Bishop multiple times, remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Evan!" Steven gritted his teeth, recalling how he had witnessed Diana act as such a drama queen, always turning small issues into big scenes</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan, realizing his misstep, fell silent. He had just put his foot in his mouth, but it was too late to take it back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a hint of mischief, Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, you have to admit, Mr. Powell and Diana do make a good pair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words were met with silence, the room suddenly quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen eyed Evan, impressed by his audacity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the friendship they shared, Owen found himself wrestling with a pang of disapproval towards Steven's recent choices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If love was absent, letting go was the noble path, yet years later, Owen had become the very embodiment of a man worse than Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The men in the room, all close to Steven, were well aware of his affection for Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was common knowledge among them that Steven was tied to Diana, a wife who didn't quite capture his favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan finally sensed the delicate shift in the air as he realized the weight of his own words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was making his final journey to the execution ground, only to find the executioner already there, standing before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan sprang to his feet with urgency. "I'll dig deeper into this, Mr. Gellar. I'll find out what's really going on and get back to you with a full report."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Evan reached the door, Steven called out, "Why are you leaving? Take me home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Relief washed over Evan; as long as Steven wasn't angry, he was safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, his legs felt weak from the near miss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swallowed hard, trying to steady his nerves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had come perilously close to believing he was out of a job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Steven took his leave, Evan leaned against the doorframe to make his own exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen, watching from behind, struggled to contain his amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another man beside Owen remarked, "Even Evan's scared?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen replied nonchalantly, "Few can withstand Steven's wrath when he's truly angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room filled with laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each man there shared a fear of Steven's anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Marsh Villa, Frank reclined on the sofa with his legs bent at the knees. A stunning woman was curled up in his embrace as he wore a gentle smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Across from them, Queenie watched the trending news with a glint of satisfaction in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Diana, one problem after another, let's see how much you could handle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a pity Steven wasn't around to witness the spectacle. Otherwise, I could add salt to his wounded pride."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, are you happy? Everyone's tearing into Diana," said Frank. He and Gale were fraternal twins, and they didn't resemble each other. Frank bore the closest resemblance to Diana. However, beneath his striking good looks, there lurked a heart steeped in malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie feigned concern. "Frank, while Diana was involved in Gale's accident, she managed to wriggle free. Now that Gale is abroad recuperating, I don't want to stir up trouble that might upset him. But he's so pitiful, doomed to a wheelchair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank sneered, "She's got her tricks, but I've got mine. I won't let her off easy. If I can't catch her with my magic, I'll make her life a living hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled with satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula, entering the room, overheard their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She entered with a composed stride, yet her eyes found Queenie in an instant, carrying an unmistakable air of menace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie Hadley, the woman in Frank's arms, blushed and slid off, standing aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, you're back," Frank greeted cheerfully, helping Paula to sit down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Drained by her relentless schedule, Paula barely acknowledged Frank with a look. Her gaze, instead, was locked intently on Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do your parents know about you and my son?" she asked calmly.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="258.html">« Prev</a><a href="260.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
