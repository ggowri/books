She hated coming back so early, but something was going down on the 10th, and she had to be here to handle it. Talk about a buzzkill&mdash;running into her ex right after getting back!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She lifted her chin and sized up Steven as he walked over, looking all cold and distant. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stood tall and straight, looking handsome as ever with that natural air of class. Every time she saw him, in this life or any other, he always made her feel he was way out of her league.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shot him a frosty look. What was this jerk doing here anyway? Shouldn't he be off with Queenie?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at Diana, noticing how different she seemed. It hit him hard&mdash;she'd really changed a lot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These past three months, he couldn't find a trace of her anywhere. And the house felt so empty without her around.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tell me, where have you been?" he asked, trying to suppress the panic rising in his chest as he looked at her unfamiliar, distant expression.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had just returned from a business trip and thought he saw her silhouette at the exit. As he got closer, he was thrilled to see it was really her. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked slimmer and fitter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's eyes were cold as she replied, "Mr. Gellar, we're divorced now. My whereabouts are none of your business."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, I should remind you that we haven't finalized the last step yet. Legally, you're still my wife."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her indifferent gaze annoyed him; things were slipping out of control, and he hated that feeling.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well..." Diana smirked, "Won't that break poor Queenie's heart? I signed those divorce papers, but you're the one dragging your feet. Your little girlfriend's been trashing me all over town, and you still won't divorce me? Steven, you jerk, shouldn't you be more worried about your sweetheart's feelings?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You! ... It was Queenie's fault last time. She said she would apologize to you personally. Don't be too hard on her."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew that he would defend Queenie, but she didn't expect that he would protect her to this extent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She staged that kidnapping all by herself to frame me. You knocked me out on the spot, made me sign a divorce agreement then a severance agreement. And now you think a simple 'sorry' from her makes it all better? You're even asking me to go easy on her? Steven, you damn jerk, stay away from me. Every time you open your big mouth, it's like a dumpster fire. Don't even show up ever again while I'm on the hunt for a hot young guy!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven wouldn&rsquo;t back up: . "Diana, you..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Bishop." A short distance away, Luna, sporting sunglasses, called out respectfully.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hi Luna," Diana acknowledged with a slight nod.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna strolled over coolly, took Diana's luggage, and stashed it in the trunk. Then, she politely opened the car door for Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't spare Steven a glance as she slipped into the car.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven watched the scene, dumbfounded. Diana was just a small-town girl. How'd she end up in such a fancy ride?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It hit him suddenly - he knew next to nothing about the woman he'd been married to for two years.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had always been this sweet, sensible girl who doted on him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For those two years when he was sick, she'd taken care of him like a pro, never once complaining about being tired. Steven could not see it at that time, and she would watch the news with him every day and read him the latest financial reports.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To treat his eyes, she even learned acupuncture and nursing...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven tried to reassure himself, "I only stood up for Queenie because she saved my life once...&nbsp;It doesn't matter now. With Diana back, it's just a matter of time before she comes around. Every time we fight about Queenie, she's always the one who caves first."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew he'd really messed up this time, but he was confident Diana would come back once she got tired of the drama. It had always been her who apologized first after their arguments.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven cockily assumed Diana would give in again, thinking she wouldn't dare to actually go through with the divorce. But this time, he was dead wrong.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two weeks went by, and Diana hadn't shown up to make amends. Steven was starting to lose his cool. He couldn't take it anymore and asked his assistant to dig up some info on Diana's whereabouts.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the back garden of Azure Hotel, Diana was sitting elegantly on the recliner, enjoying herself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past two weeks,&nbsp;she had figured out the situation in Capitole.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What happened in the Marsh family that day was kept secret from the public. With Steven covering the situation, no media dared to report on Queenie's scandals.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But it didn't matter. Queenie became bolder because of this incident, and she would create more drama.&nbsp;Diana didn't have to do anything, she could just sit back and watch the show.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She swore to take back everything she had given to the Marsh and Gellar families.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Admiring her rhinestone manicure, which sparkled beautifully in the sunlight, Diana gently swiped her fingers across her phone screen to make a call.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, end our cooperation with the Marsh family and the Gellar family."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="5.html">« Prev</a><a href="7.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
