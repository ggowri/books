She had seen him from a distance just now and had not seen his face. Now looking at him from a closer distance, she found that he had lost a lot of weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had not been reborn, she would have felt heartbroken seeing Gale like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gale Marsh, what's wrong?" Diana asked in a strange tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale's heart suddenly ached. She was no longer willing to call him by his first name anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale said, "Diana, I wrongly blamed you for what happened between Althea and I that night. I'm sorry. I didn't expect that all of this was planned by Queenie and Penelope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook his head and said, "No need to apologize. Your apology is cheap. Althea and I are very satisfied with the current result."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale said, "Diana, I know it's too late for me to say anything now. Will you never forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I will never forgive you and Steven." Diana would always remember what they had done to her for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, next time we meet, please pretend you don't know me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana left after saying this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale spoke quickly, "Diana, are Althea and the baby okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned around abruptly, glared at him, and said emotionally, "Gale, stay away from Althea. In a few years, she will meet a man who loves her more. I will never let you destroy her happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finished speaking angrily, Diana strode away against the wind and snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale said nothing more. The cold wind and snow hurt his face. He wanted to say that he was no longer qualified to see Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he felt distressed when he thought that Althea would marry another man with his baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had he made his life so miserable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle said, "Let's go. You have nothing left. Not disturbing you is your last kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale laughed at himself. "Kyle, do I deserve it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle said, "Yes. But broken bones well set become stronger. It's best for you to try to stand up again. Only when you improve yourself will the girl meet you." Kyle had been taking care of Gale for two months and had a good impression of Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale looked at the sky. His eyes flashed, and he secretly made up his mind to try his best to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope's incident caused a big stir on the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie returned home, she saw the news: [Penelope cannot be released.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Gale knew the truth, he could do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was very happy that another obstacle had been removed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she had left Paula's home, she lived in the apartment that Steven bought for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie happily popped the champagne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had gotten Paula's company. And next was the Foliot family and Cecil's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, Cecil escaped, and Wyatt fell. Next time, Cecil might not be so lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the wine glass, Queenie walked to the balcony and stood barefoot on the soft carpet. She smiled happily, picked up her cell phone and dialed a familiar number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, did you miss me?" A lazy voice came from the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, "I miss you. I have been the one who contacted you all these years, but you never contacted me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man said, "You know that our relationship cannot be discovered. If it is discovered, Steven will not help you, and my plan will not succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "I have already taken over Paula's company. Next is the Foliot family. I have slowly helped you open up the domestic market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man said, "You are amazing. Queenie, I will come back after you tear up the agreement. I will find a time to hypnotize Steven and make him forget about Diana. He is out of your control now. We can't wait."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="583.html">« Prev</a><a href="585.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
