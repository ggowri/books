He had been working hard to change and make up for his past wrongs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Evan, who had entered with him. "Evan, take Zora to the police station. Investigate everything&mdash;what she stole, the money, all of it. Hand over the evidence to the police and find her son. The villa and car were bought with money stolen from my grandmother. Look into every detail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora was stunned. She realized she had spoken too rashly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted provoking Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She should not have said such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she could control the situation as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and begged, "Mr. Gellar, I made a mistake. Please forgive my family. Over the years, I've cared for your grandparents. Doesn't that count for something?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I beg you. Everything was my doing. It has nothing to do with my son. The money for his villa was given to me by Madam Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana interrupted angrily, "You knew the money was from Helen. Go ask around. What kind of housekeeper gets a whole villa as a gift? That was a blessing! But did you show any gratitude? No! You repaid kindness with evil. You gave Helen slow-acting poison. She trusted and relied on you, yet you stole millions of dollars in jewelry from her. She didn't even hold it against you, but what did you do? Who do you think you're fooling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora was stunned by Diana's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was rich. She could have just turned a blind eye to it as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why report me to the police?" she demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at her and snapped, "If you hadn't worked with Queenie to poison Helen, perhaps she would have looked the other way. But you dared to conspire against her. Do you really think you're innocent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora turned ashen. It turned out they knew everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew she had worked with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced a laugh. "Diana, do you have any proof? Dare you make such accusations without evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no proof that she had poisoned Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her son knew the law well. He had told her that without evidence, Steven couldn't do anything to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed at her arrogance and pointed to a hidden camera in the corner. "The entire villa has surveillance cameras&mdash;installed legally. The last time I visited Helen, I noticed she had been poisoned. I overheard your conversation with Queenie in the garden. Helen opposed her marrying into the Gellar family, so Queenie targeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad for her. She underestimated me and my skills. She didn't think I could neutralize the poison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared at Diana, not expecting her to find out about the conspiracy so early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other night, Queenie had called him, claiming she had been followed by bad people. He had left Diana for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Diana, you knew back then? Why didn't you tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him indifferently. "Would it have mattered? Would you have believed me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I found out Helen was poisoned, I told no one except her. She had the cameras installed, which captured everything Zora did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even when evidence was in front of you, you wouldn't believe me. Why would you listen without proof?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her questions struck Steven like sharp arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this matter involved Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A year ago, he might have believed Queenie and hurt Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned back to Zora. "We have all the evidence. There's no use denying it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora burst into tears. "Madam Gellar, please forgive me. I was wrong. Please let me go. You're fine now, aren't you? The poison is gone. But my son is still young."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen sneered, "Oh? Youth excuses wrongdoing? Housekeeper, you've been with me for over ten years. You know how I've treated you. Do you think I should forgive someone who tried to kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your son studies law. Even his job was found through my connections. You don't understand the law, but doesn't your son?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And every day, you call him and ask how to get rid of evidence. He knows everything you've done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat on the ground, looking lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was smiling, but Zora knew how angry she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was determined not to let them off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven waved his hand, and the police took Zora away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora cried desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched with cold indifference. After Zora was taken away, she asked, "Grandma, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen took her hand and smiled lovingly, "Diana, I'm fine. I thought you were coming at noon. I just had some new bird's nests. It was very good. Remember to take some home when you go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should have the best food and the best things. Take good care of your skin and be the most beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you are still young. Don't always think about sacrificing for others. Be good to yourself. We women should think of ourselves. No one else will truly care for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are too kind. That's why those foolish people bully you. Do you understand now?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="883.html">« Prev</a><a href="885.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
