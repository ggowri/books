His suitcase probably contains liquids, so he can't pass security. He'll take a private jet. Keep an eye on him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned and then replied, "Alright, Diana. You've looked into the Mysterium Organization too, right? What do you think they're up to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to hear what the Mysterium Organization looked like through Diana's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "The</span><span>y</span><span> focus on biotechnology. It's been around for years, but all we know is just surface-level information.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>W</span><span>hatever Andrew's carrying, it's either dangerous, shocking, or something that could turn things around for George."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always been wary of Andrew's revenge. Now that he's back, so is the danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said seriously, "Diana, let's meet tomorrow. We need to talk."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana refused. "No. Queenie and George think you're dead, but Andrew is sharper and more suspicious than they are. Let's see what Andrew brought back first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The moment he's back, he </span><span>definitely</span><span> </span><span>wants to take over the Gellar Group. Your biotech company isn't ready yet. Let's see what he's planning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Tell me his updates</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied gently, "Alright! As soon as he arrives, I'll let you know right away. Take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Alright! I'm hanging up now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven hesitated for a moment, "Goodbye."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up first. Steven stared at his phone for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't called him in a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Steven used to get annoyed when Diana texted him, reminding him to eat on time or take his medicine. He found it irritating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As an adult, he didn&rsquo;t think he needed her constantly nagging him about meals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in his life, only she cared for him like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was in a good mood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Evan, "Evan, I'm hungry. Get me something to eat. Make sure there's plenty of beef ribs. I feel like having beef ribs tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan quickly put his phone down and smiled. "Sure thing, Mr. Gellar. You're finally feeling hungry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he went out, he grabbed something delicious to eat. When he came back, he asked Steven if he was hungry, but Steven replied that he wasn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had just taken a call from Diana. And then, suddenly, he was hungry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, only Diana could change him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan prepared him something light. Steven was in a good mood, so he ate a lot for dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie went with Dylan to the hospital to get his wound dressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His finger had been broken. By the time he finished surgery, it was already early morning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The long wait left Queenie feeling annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn&rsquo;t managed to teach Diana a lesson. Instead, she was stuck awake until the early hours.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan&rsquo;s finger was all bandaged up. He stared at his immobile finger, seething with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was determined to get revenge for tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had everything now, yet she still fought with Queenie. She even snatched the entire Gellar Group from Steven's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Dylan heard the news abroad, he found it unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was highly capable, and now he was helping Queenie. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan looked at Queenie and said, "Queenie, it's late. Let me take you home to rest. Whatever it is, we can talk tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She laughed and said, "Dylan, we don&rsquo;t even have a home anymore. </span><span>Paula</span><span>, Eric, and Gale moved into a shabby little apartment. She&rsquo;s probably afraid we&rsquo;ll take her inheritance, so now she&rsquo;s pretending to be poor while secretly handing the company over to Eric."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;m wondering if she plans to give the company to Eric. After all, among the four of you brothers, he&rsquo;s the most capable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious that Queenie&rsquo;s words were meant to sow discord, but Dylan didn&rsquo;t notice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face grew darker. "Why </span><span>would be </span><span>Eric? I&rsquo;m part of the Barnes family too. I still have inheritance rights. Even if you&rsquo;re illegitimate, you still have a claim. </span><span>Paula</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>gone too far. I&rsquo;m going back to confront her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled. "Dylan, you&rsquo;re back now, but they didn&rsquo;t even call you. And you came to see me. I think </span><span>they</span><span> probably believe I pulled you over. </span><span>Y</span><span>ou&rsquo;ll definitely get scolded</span><span> from them</span><span>. </span><span>T</span><span>hey might not even let you in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? </span><span>Not</span><span> let me in?" Dylan let out a bitter laugh</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The company belongs to the four of us brothers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why does Eric get to run it alone?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Mom really made that decision, I&rsquo;ll make a scene for sure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "Queenie, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll take back everything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let&rsquo;s go, take you home first. Where are you staying now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Dylan heard George&rsquo;s voice. "No need. I&rsquo;ll pick Queenie up. You should go back to </span><span>Paula</span><span> and your brothers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan saw it was </span><span>&lsquo;</span><span>Steven</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span> and smiled. "Steven, since you&rsquo;re here, I can head back with peace of mind. Wait for my good news."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie pretended to look worried. "Dylan, if you can&rsquo;t convince them, maybe fake joining them. Find out the location</span><span> of Eric</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s company</span><span>, take it back from them. We may be dutiful children, but we have to reclaim our</span><span> things</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan&rsquo;s expression was firm. "Don&rsquo;t worry. If </span><span>Paula</span><span> </span><span>refuses, I&rsquo;ll take the company back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why can Eric run the company, but I can&rsquo;t?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George said coldly, "Then you better head back. It&rsquo;s getting late. If there&rsquo;s anything, talk tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan said his goodbyes and took a cab straight home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour and a half later, he got out of the cab. Staring at the rundown neighborhood, he felt disbelief. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Paula</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">pretending to be poor, living in a place like this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was the rich daughter of the Barnes family. </span><span>She</span><span> had always been privileged. How could she possibly get used to </span><span>such place</span><span>?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">R</span><span style="font-style: italic;">eally broke, or fak</span><span style="font-style: italic;">e</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan felt completely lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the message Eric had sent him, he walked through the gate of the complex. There wasn&rsquo;t even a guard at the entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his twenty-something years of life, it was his first time in a place like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once inside, he found the apartment building. He was stunned&mdash;it was an old walk-up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was used to living in villas. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time he climbed to the fifth floor, he angrily pounded on the door.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1040.html">« Prev</a><a href="1042.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
