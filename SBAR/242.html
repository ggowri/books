"No, I couldn't get through. It's out of service."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana reassured him, "Don't worry. Olivia is there this time; nothing will happen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita and Cecil had no choice but to place their hopes on Olivia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">About ten minutes later, Olivia came out of the room, her face a bit pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita's voice trembled as she asked, "Ms. Laurier, is my son alright now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere was tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia wiped the sweat from her forehead and said, "Mrs. Gellar, I can't intervene too much, but I managed to save Mr. Farley's life. Today was his death tribulation, man-made, but it was possible to prevent it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita's heart finally settled. As long as a life was saved, it was enough. She repeated, "Thank you!" three times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're too kind," Olivia replied, then turned to Cecil. "Mr. Farley, I'll be leaving tomorrow and don't know how long I'll be gone. I see that you, too, have a death tribulation in six months, and it will be severe. I have a jade talisman here engraved by me. No matter what, don't take it off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia handed the white jade talisman to Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil expressed his gratitude. "Thank you, Ms. Laurier! How much should I pay you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Olivia smiled and replied, "For the talisman and saving your father's life, I'll only charge a merit fee of $3,666. You can send it to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil promptly sent the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita looked at her inflexible grandson and laughed angrily. "You don't know how to adapt, do you? Is your father's life worth so little? Transfer 10 million to Ms. Laurier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, no, no," Olivia quickly responded. "I only take what's deserved. It wasn't me who saved your lives. It was Diana. Based on your family's fate, to be blunt, there is almost no hope for survival in six months."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Initially, Rita and Cecil didn't believe in such mystical talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finding much evidence, they now believed Olivia's words, as everything seemed traceable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was very grateful to Olivia for her help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Cecil's phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello! Jack, how is my father now?" Cecil asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cecil, how did you know your father was in trouble?" Jack asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was anxious. "Jack, don't worry about how I found out. Is my father okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah! It's not good. We were set up; the project was stolen, and they even wanted our lives. On the way back, our car went off the road near the sea and was hit into the water. Luckily, the tide was low. As the car rolled down, nothing serious happened. Mr. Farley only suffered minor injuries while I fractured my arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're in the hospital now. Once we're treated, we'll head back. It's strange though. The car rolled over several times, but we only suffered minor injuries. The car frame is gone. It scared me to death."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil glanced sharply at Olivia. If it weren't for her, his father would've been in real danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cecil, I was so lucky today. It must have been God's blessing. When I return, I'll make an offer. At a crash site like this, we should've been dead or disabled. We were truly fortunate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil laughed. "That's great, Jack. Please be careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, I know. Heaven protects good people. I'll send you a photo of the wrecked car. Your dad and I only had minor injuries."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Cecil hung up, Jack quickly sent the photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil gasped when he saw the accident photos.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="241.html">« Prev</a><a href="243.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
