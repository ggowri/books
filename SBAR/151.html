He patted his mouth quickly and said with regret, "Mr. Gellar, I am sorry. You asked me to say it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Humph!" Steven said, "Evan if I threaten Diana by kidnapping her grandfather, will she change her mind and stay with me as always?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was shocked by Steven's question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan thought, "Steven is an idiot in terms of pursuing a woman. Steven had always been pursued by Diana, so he doesn't know how to be the active one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan told Steven the truth, "Mr. Gellar, you shouldn't be so self-centered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that time, Evan's cell phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Jeff. He said, "Evan, please ask Steven to come to the hospital quickly. Queenie committed suicide."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was speechless. He thought Queenie was really like a bitch, making a fuss and then threatening to kill herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Jeff Marsh, you should find a doctor first. My boss is not a doctor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff said, "Stop talking nonsense. Tell Steven that Queenie committed suicide because of him. Tell him to go to the hospital immediately. I've sent you the address."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff hung up the phone after he finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan looked at Steven and said, "Mr. Gellar, it's Mr. Jeff Marsh. Ms. Marsh committed suicide because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned and said, "Let's go and take a look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "Well, Queenie is the most important for Mr. Gellar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan knew the hospital's address and went to the underground parking lot with Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was in Diana's company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Alexander had breakfast together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander had a morning meeting, so Diana sent Alexander out and waited for the assistant to drive over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While waiting for the car at the door, they chatted happily. In the breeze, Diana's hair was slightly lifted, revealing her neck and collarbone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled, and she looked bright and beautiful in the sunshine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment Steven noticed her, he saw how beautiful Diana was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander was also very gentle. They stood together and seemed a good match.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing this, Steven was angry. He growled, "Stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan also saw Diana and Alexander. From Steven's voice, Evan knew that Steven was angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan thought, "Steven did such a bad thing to Diana. How could he be angry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan quickly stopped the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven opened the car door and got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He walked to Diana. His expression was gloomy. It seemed that Steven was very angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned and looked at Steven warily. She thought, "What was wrong with the look in this bastard's eyes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, Queenie committed suicide. Come with me to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's eyes narrowed slightly. She was surprised when she found out that Queenie committed suicide. She sneered, "If you divorce me, she will come back to her life and marry you even if she is buried. What does it have to do with me whether she commits suicide or not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If she dies and you commit suicide for love, wouldn't that be better for me? I'm still your wife now, and all your property will be mine in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Go to the hospital to see her quickly. If you want to commit suicide for love, call me in advance so I can collect your body."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing Diana's words, Alexander laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at Alexander angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander smiled and explained, "I'm sorry, Mr. Gellar, that your true love committed suicide. But, what does it have to do with Diana? You are here just to disgust her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana felt that Alexander was cool and he used the word "disgust" accurately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alexander, the car is here. You should go to the company first. I will call you later." Diana said in a gentle voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander looked at her worriedly and said, "Diana, how about I stay here with you?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="150.html">« Prev</a><a href="152.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
