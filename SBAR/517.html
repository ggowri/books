Mario was afraid that they would have more trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that things were changing, but he couldn't find anything. So, he felt a little panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario thought, "Paula dotes on Ms. Marsh, so our affairs go so smoothly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Steven's attitude is confused."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, do we still need to implement our previous plan? I feel Steven's attitude is different from before. In order to be foolproof, I think the master's plan should still be implemented."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie also noticed Steven's ambiguous attitude towards her. It made her feel like she was about to lose control of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrange a hypnotist. I will find an opportunity as soon as possible." Queenie felt that she could not wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If Steven forgets about Diana, the two old guys in the Gellar family will not be my match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Queenie thought about it, the more she felt that it could not be delayed any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven began to care about Diana. It was not a good thing for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, who was hiding in the dark, was shocked. He thought, "Is Queenie going to attack Steven?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doesn't she only love Steven? Why does she attack Steven?</span><span> </span><span>What the hell does she want to do?</span><span> </span><span>Who is the master Mario is referring to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was nervous. He quickly turned off the sound of his cell phone and saw that the two had already got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ran over anxiously and opened the door of the car. He then smiled apologetically, "Queenie, why didn't you wait for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned. If Eric hadn't suddenly run out, she would have forgotten that he was her driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, please take me to the company. I have a shoot later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Eric drove her to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario handed the tablet to Queenie, his eyes slightly gloomy. "Ms. Marsh, Diana has been cooperating with Alexander's company. This quarter, her sales volume increased several times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie already knew about this. She sneered, "What kind of talent does Diana have? She has been home for a few years. But I have never seen her draw a design. Her design may have been stolen from others, or someone else drew it for her later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said gloomily, "There will be a national fashion design league in a few days. Why don't we sign her up in the name of the Marsh family? Then, we can expose her true colors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled faintly, thinking, "It's a good idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Eric and asked with a smile, "Eric, Diana is a country girl. There will be a national design league next month. Why don't we sign Diana up to prove her ability? Eric, you know that everyone has questioned her position as a designer director."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't we give her this opportunity to prove herself and dispel everyone's doubts about her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric gripped the steering wheel tightly. He thought, "Queenie wants to embarrass Diana. She's really vicious.</span><span> </span><span>Why didn't I sense her vicious thoughts before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, does Diana really have that ability?</span><span> </span><span>If Diana does, she can defeat those rumors. It'll be a good thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled, "Queenie, you are studying design as well. Will you participate in the design league?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled when she heard that, thinking, "Diana has always been my foil. Now that I'm starting to enter the entertainment industry, let her continue to be my foil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So she smiled, "Eric, if I participate, will it be unfair to Diana?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="516.html">« Prev</a><a href="518.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
