Anyway, he can't hit a woman, right?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, Ms. Barnes is here, too. I just saw her get out of the car. Something even more exciting might happen.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but tighten her grip on her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did not reply, but she knew that Luna would send her a message later about what happened...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula got out of the car, walked gracefully into the villa gate, and gazed at Amelie, who was embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie suddenly glanced up at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instantly shouted excitedly, "Paula, it's you! What are you doing here? How do you know about this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smiled elegantly, "It's me! I thought you loved each other so much. However, a video led him to beat you up. His affection is nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It dawns on me now that Jeff doesn't care about anyone but money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you are talking nonsense. He loves me. He married you for money. But you, a fool, have supported us for so many years..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You impressed me. It's the first time I've seen someone so proud of getting something for nothing," Paula interrupted Amelie. Noticing that she was about to stand up, she kicked her hard in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie, who had just regained her balance, fell awkwardly again in the snow.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." She covered her aching stomach and glared at Paula fiercely, feeling aggrieved and angry. She could never have dreamed of such a scene. She was Jeff's wife, and Paula should have been humiliated by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why was Paula, even in such a miserable state, so confident?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, why did you kick me? You are abandoned. Kicking me makes no difference. You can't capture a man's heart, and your man is mine now. If you have the guts, hit Jeff. It takes two to tango."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I understand it takes two to tango. I kicked you for a very simple reason. Since I've covered your basic necessities, you should behave yourself and not be arrogant in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I realize what you want to say to me today. You just plan to show off in front of me and be proud of your victory. But did you really win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That disgusting and old man, Jeff, is quite suitable for you. If trash stays with trash, my house will be clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for what you took from me, I will reclaim it. And Mrs. Foliot will target you. You enjoy being someone else's mistress and destroying other people's families. Wait and see whether your man will protect you to the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile, Paula continued, "Do you think your good days are coming? No, from the moment Jeff and I divorced, your hard times began in earnest. Let's wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the villa with a confident grin, she sent a message to Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she turned and looked resentfully at the villa behind her. "Jeff, go back to where you came from. You had nothing back then, and neither should you now after our divorce.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you back to your dire straits," Paula muttered to herself. Then, she got in the car and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amelie was right. It took two to tango.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="617.html">« Prev</a><a href="619.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
