"How is Penelope even here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's heart raced as realization struck. "Penelope must have seen Althea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dashed back to Althea, who was struggling to stand upright amid the pain. "Althea, I just saw Penelope outside. She looks like she's figured out you're pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea scoffed, a bitter edge to her voice. "Let her know. This baby is mine, not Gale's. Even if he finds out, it won't change anything between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you have to help me. If Queenie catches wind of this, she's going to try to get rid of me and my baby. I've been burned by her schemes before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tried to comfort her. "Althea, switching hospitals at this point is risky. Why not stick around and see what Penelope's game is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worry creased Althea's forehead as she shook her head. "No, Diana. I can't gamble with my child's life. This baby is mine to keep, with no ties to Gale or the Marsh family. I've seen Gale's true character. He's not just blind but morally bankrupt, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for Queenie's deceit, I wouldn't be insulted by Gale. This baby appeared unexpectedly, but I refuse to abandon it. As a mother, it's my job to protect my child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Marsh family dares to come after it, I've kept evidence from that night. I will sue Gale for raping me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was icy, steely resolve evident in every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was done forgiving Gale, let alone loving him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since moving out of the Marsh Villa, Althea had severed all ties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would not give Gale another chance to hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took Althea's hands and smiled reassuringly, "Althea, you've got me in your corner. I won't let anything happen to you. I promise I'll be here through it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick nod, Diana stepped out of the room, easy determination etched in her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sought out the floor's doctor, discreetly dropping some cash to secure a room change for Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Althea's ward was occupied by someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, below, Penelope was busy on her phone, messaging her aunt, Rachel Max.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Aunt Rachel, keep an eye on the pregnant woman in room 408.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel replied curtly: [Got it, but I'm swamped right now.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rachel was buried under a mountain of tasks. She glanced at Penelope's photo, struggling to make out the woman's features against the backdrop of swirling snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was in the VIP room 408, but she'd have to check the records later to confirm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Rachel was able to look into it, the room had already been reassigned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea's ward had been switched to room 419, significantly far from 408.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up in Althea's room, Diana kept a vigilant watch, sensing unease in the air, though nothing out of the ordinary occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Althea's contractions grew more intense, the pain escalating as Diana stayed by her side, ever patient. Finally, at three-thirty in the morning, Althea welcomed a baby boy into the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this small island hospital, it was customary for Diana to accompany her friend into the delivery room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the baby arrived, Diana expertly washed him, a skill that elicited astonishment from the attending doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow, young lady, you've got some serious skills there. The baby really enjoyed the bath&mdash;cried a couple of times, but now it's all quiet."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="561.html">« Prev</a><a href="563.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
