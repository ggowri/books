She felt like her head was about to explode, the pain sharp and disorienting. Her mind went blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head violently, her eyes scanning the window inch by inch. Outside, she saw the car that had nearly hit them just moments ago, now plunged into the river.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna, still recovering from the shock, turned quickly to look at Diana. "Diana, are you okay? Did you get hurt? I turned the wheel too hard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head, still dazed. "I'm fine, I'm fine. Luna, are you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna winced slightly as she shifted, her arm aching, but it wasn't anything serious. "I'm good. But there's no doubt that guy was after us. That bastard was trying to kill us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna pulled out her phone and dialed 911, then added the emergency services number for an ambulance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the other driver had tried to kill them, she wasn't about to leave him to die alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were okay for now, but he had plunged into the river. In these freezing temperatures, he'd have a long, painful fight ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a few deep breaths, the worst of the pain fading. She finally pushed open the car door and stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was late, and since it was a holiday, the roads were practically empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cars passed by, none of them slowing down to check what had happened. No one was stopping to help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned to Luna. "Luna, move the car over to the side. I'm going to see what's going on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The river wasn't fast-moving, but it was deep. If the guy inside the car couldn't get out, if he was stuck in that freezing water, he wouldn't last long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna frowned. "Don't go. It's too dangerous. He came after us to kill us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head, her expression hardening. "No. He's not a threat to us anymore. He's got his own problems now. He's on his own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stepped into the biting cold wind, flinching for a moment as the chill cut through her. She tightened her jacket against the freezing night air. The temperature was well below freezing, and the sight of the man submerged in that icy river felt like something straight out of a nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked to the edge of the bridge, staring at the shattered guardrail. Her breath caught in her throat&mdash;the crash had been so violent, there was no obstruction at all. The car had just plummeted straight into the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Help! Help me! Please, someone, save me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cries for help were quickly shredded by the wind, lost in the freezing night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shouted back, her voice sharp and cold. "I can help you out, but you have to tell me&mdash;who's the one trying to kill me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman in the river paused, his body trembling from the freezing water. His voice came out weak, shivering with the cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just a few minutes, the river's icy grip had nearly paralyzed him, his teeth chattering as he spoke, "I... I don't know! The brakes failed, I swear, I didn't mean to hurt you! Miss, you've got to be mistaken. Please, just help me out, or call an ambulance. I'm gonna die out here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His head popped out of the window, blood trickling down from a cut on his forehead, quickly freezing in the frigid air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car door wouldn't budge, and the window was barely open enough for him to stick his head out. The car was sinking fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was terrified&mdash;more terrified than he'd ever been. He'd never imagined that Diana's driver would be so quick on the brakes, avoiding the crash completely, while his car had plunged into the river. It was maddening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's voice was cold as ice. "Since you won't tell me who's behind this, I guess I don't have to save you. Enjoy the freezing water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman's face twitched, the desperation in his eyes now mixed with frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This woman was heartless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was practically freezing to death, and she was still threatening him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lady, you've got a heart of stone. Just get me out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana raised an eyebrow, her eyes fixed coldly on the car sinking lower into the water. Her gaze was as frigid as the night itself. "Why would I save you? You're the one who tried to kill me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman screamed, panic rising in his voice, "But you're fine, right?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's expression didn't change. "Just because I'm fine, does that mean I should let you off the hook?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman's voice became desperate. "Yes! If you're fine, let me go! I swear, if you help me out, I won't hurt you! But if you leave me here... you'll regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fury ignited inside Diana. "Then stay down there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, no, no, please!" Norman's voice cracked with fear. "I didn't mean it! I've been frozen out here too long. I swear, I'm not your enemy! Please, just pull me out, or I'm gonna drown!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a tremor in his voice now&mdash;a real, raw fear. As the water continued to rise around him, his panic was palpable. He'd never thought it would end like this. All he'd wanted was money, not to lose his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana watched him struggle, her patience thinning. He wouldn't even tell her who was behind the attack. She had already called the cops, but whether he survived or not was no longer her concern. It was up to him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned to leave, and that was when the man completely broke down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, no, no, please, don't leave! If you don't pull me up, this won't be over. I'll come after you again, I swear. I'll kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice cracked with fear, tears streaming down his face as he realized just how ruthless she was. She could walk away without a second thought, leaving him to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana paused and glanced back over her shoulder, her tone chilling. "Fine. Don't want to talk? I'll find out myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman, desperate and near tears, could hardly believe the cold, unflinching strength in her. Most people would be terrified, wouldn't dare stand on a bridge and talk like that to a man who could kill them. But Diana? She stood there without flinching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahh! The water's coming in! Please, help me! Someone, anyone&mdash;save us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned back once more, her voice cutting through the air. "Last chance. Are you going to talk or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman felt the icy river seeping further into the car, the freezing water piercing through the cracks. It was like needles in his feet as the ice shards sliced into his skin. The cold was unbearable, and he could feel his legs going numb. Every second felt like it could be his last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A pained hiss escaped his lips. If this kept up, he was going to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't go. I'll talk!" he shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's voice was as cold as the water surrounding him. "Good. I'm listening."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman let out a sigh of relief and shouted, "I don't know who it was! Someone gave me 200 thousand dollars to run your car off the bridge. That's all I know. They didn't say anything else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face twisted with anger. "What the hell? Who's the bastard who thought 200 thousand dollars was enough to buy my life? Do they really think I'm worth that little?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman glanced down at the water, now rising to his waist, while the woman on the shore continued to stand there, casually tossing out sarcastic remarks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ugh...!" His body was wracked with pain. The cold was unbearable. Every inch of him felt like it was being pierced by a thousand needles. His legs burned with sharp, freezing pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahhh! Why aren't you helping me?!" he screamed, his voice filled with desperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood firm against the bitter wind, and her face flushed bright red from the cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! Help you? In your dreams. I'm not saving you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman's frustration hit a breaking point. "You've got no honor! I've told you the truth, so why won't you help me?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shot him a cold, mocking smile. "Why would I save someone who tried to kill me, and now thinks so little of me? 200 thousand dollars? That's what they think my life is worth? They're delusional."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Norman's eyes widened as the realization hit him. "Wait&mdash;no, no, I never said you weren't worth 200 thousand dollars! Someone else paid me that! It's not my fault. I'm just doing the job. Come on, pull me up, and I'll tell you another secret."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew exactly what kind of person he was&mdash;a mercenary who'd sell his soul for money. There was no secret, just another pathetic attempt to get her to rescue him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She raised an eyebrow, a sly grin spreading across her face. "Enjoy the rest of your misery. I'm out."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="973.html">« Prev</a><a href="975.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
