"What did you just say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie chuckled. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, Diana and Steven haven</span><span>'</span><span>t slept together yet. If you don</span><span>'</span><span>t act now, she</span><span>'</span><span>ll be his woman forever."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes at Queenie. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And how do you know they haven</span><span>'</span><span>t slept together?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie gave a mysterious smile, her gaze lingering on Alexander's slightly wicked yet handsome face. That face was undeniably captivating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, you don</span><span>'</span><span>t strike me as a man inexperienced in such matters. I refuse to believe you can</span><span>'</span><span>t tell the difference between a woman and a girl. Diana is pure. It</span><span>'</span><span>s obvious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and Steven weren</span><span>'</span><span>t together. Even after their marriage, they slept in separate rooms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew all of this&mdash;because she made it happen. Steven deliberately acted like he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t stand Diana. To this day, they hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t been intimate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After they split, she sent Diana countless photos of herself with George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana mistook George for Steven and found him utterly repulsive. How could she possibly sleep with him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, misunderstandings piled up between them. Even if they cleared things up, with Diana's personality, she would never engage in anything overly intimate with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she was certain that Diana and Steven were still innocent with each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Alexander knew Diana and Steven were innocent. So why did he choose to play the villain?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just leave. I won't work with you. Do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave Queenie a meaningful look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie understood. She smiled and said, "There's a business gala tomorrow night. Mr. Powell, will you be attending?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's gaze darkened, his voice low. "Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn't say more. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then, Mr. Powell, wait for my good news."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie knew Alexander was just pretending to be aloof. A simple scheme had torn through his facade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How boring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Queenie left, Alexander stood up, restless. He walked to the window, staring at the misty sky outside, a bitter feeling rising in his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still remembered the first time he met Diana. She was stunning, with big, bright eyes that seemed to speak. Her smile was radiant and captivating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes held an unmistakable admiration for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the first time he saw such a genuine, radiant smile in a woman</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes, paired with admiration just for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was the blind date Leopold had set up for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what he never expected was that she was Steven's wife&mdash;and they weren</span><span>'</span><span>t even divorced yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, he simply thought Leopold had made a mistake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold had set him up on a blind date with a married woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet in that moment, he suddenly felt that even if Diana was divorced, it wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He fell for her at first sight. Her radiant, captivating smile completely drew him in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dwelling in darkness for so long, a crack suddenly appeared before him. A faint light seeped through, giving him a glimpse of hope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he kept waiting. A year passed, and they still hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t divorced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waited patiently, moving all his overseas businesses back home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what he got was Diana willingly calling Steven "husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hah! Steven, what makes you think you can compete with me?" His face darkened with fury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, Diana woke up to a call from Althea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Althea's name on the screen, Diana hesitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She already knew what Althea was going to say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat beside her, the two of them just about to start breakfast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at Diana's phone, which kept buzzing. He asked, "Diana, aren't you going to answer that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes dimmed as she replied, "I will."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She swiped to answer. "Hello? Althea."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea's voice was weak. "Diana, I forgave Gale. Do you think I'm... useless?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a deep breath. What could she say? Hadn't she chosen Steven too?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, Althea. As long as you're happy, you didn't make the wrong choice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yeah, as long as it feels right, then it's not a mistake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale made up for his mistakes, and she changed the Barnes family's fate. Paula and her brothers all survived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could she have also changed Gale and Althea's marriage?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the previous life, Althea had married a wealthy Southern businessman and lived quite comfortably with her child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I had a dream. In it, my family married me off to a wealthy businessman. At first, he treated me well. But a year later, when I was pregnant with our second child, he killed Harlan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was too shocked to say a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe, after her rebirth, she was meant to save the people around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, what happened next?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea gave a faint smile. "How would I know what happened next? Diana, I even dreamed that you died too. What's that all about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This world was just too surreal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What kind of space was she in to trigger a butterfly effect that impacted everyone?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, is that why you chose Gale?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea said, "Diana, believe it or not, I think choosing your brother this time is the right decision. You know I've liked him since we were kids. Now he's asking for my forgiveness. I'm willing to give him a chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to protect my son and keep him from getting hurt by anyone. Before Gale met Penelope, he really was a good brother, a good man."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, he took care of Harlan alone last night. Harlan likes him. Diana, after dreaming about my son being hurt by that monster, I've been living in agony."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was too heartbroken to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, we all respect your choice. You'll find happiness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea said, "Yeah! Just wanted to let you know. I won</span><span>'</span><span>t keep you, I</span><span>'</span><span>m off to check on Harlan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up the phone, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her past life, Althea got married, and all Diana knew was that she seemed happy. She had no idea so much had happened to Althea afterward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's mind was a mess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven slid the steak in front of her and said softly, "Diana, eat your breakfast first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She picked up her fork and started eating her breakfast quietly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After breakfast, Steven asked, "Has Althea forgiven Gale?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Yeah! Maybe she hasn't fully forgiven him yet, but she's giving him a chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pressed his lips together slightly. He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t have a good impression of Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s brothers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, there's a banquet tonight. Come with me," Steven said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t have much going on today&mdash;just a business banquet in the evening.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked surprised. "This is the first time you're taking me to a banquet. You always brought Queenie before. Everyone said you two were perfect together. Now you're suddenly switching the leading lady to me. Aren't you worried people will give you strange looks?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1138.html">« Prev</a><a href="1140.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
