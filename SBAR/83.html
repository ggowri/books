Noticing the handsome and gentle Nolan beside her, a flicker of jealousy crossed Queenie's mind. Diana always seemed to land on her feet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She approached with a sneer. "Well, well! Diana, it was Cecil yesterday, and who's this guy today?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana marveled at the peculiarity of fate, running into Queenie every day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, </span><span>it</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s none</span><span> of your business. I've left the Marsh family. I'm not competing with you for anything anymore. You'd better keep quiet and stop messing with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven might protect you once or twice, but after the eighth or tenth time, do you think he'll still take your side?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When your nasty true colors are laid bare in front of him, do you really think he'll keep defending you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last night, she'd posted on Instagram about going back to her ex-husband's place, along with a photo of her cooking in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, Queenie had come rushing over right away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Queenie's most significant fear now was her getting back together with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's attitude towards her had already started to change, and Queenie was feeling threatened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Instagram post, of course, she'd come running.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Diana's Instagram was set to private, which was only visible to Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie faltered for a moment, realizing she probably didn't know what had happened after she left last night. She boasted smugly,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh Diana, after you left last night, I stayed to keep Steven company. He was so gentle with me. I'm still sore, if you know what I mean."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was sensible enough to catch what Queenie was saying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly felt heartbroken, and she thought she wouldn't be upset anymore if she heard such words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she would still grieve without warning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "Well, you were so eager to be a mistress, and you wanted to say it in public. Queenie, no one else would have done it but you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you..." Queenie was so furious that she stomped her feet, and she couldn't argue with it because Steven and Diana weren't divorced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Queenie had found a way to get them divorced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope stood condescendingly in front of Diana, looking aggressive as she smiled contemptuously,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, the unloved woman was the mistress, and you stole everything that belonged to Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, you have signed an agreement of disassociation with your family. I don't want a woman like you as my family, and I'll be ashamed if anyone finds out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope thought Diana was a tomboy from the countryside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Diana's outfit today didn't look like a tomboy at all. On the contrary, she looked more noble than a girl from a rich family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought Penelope was out of her mind. Why was Penelope so confident that Diana would be her family?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope wouldn't necessarily </span><span>be one of</span><span> the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Penelope, who's going to be your family? You haven't married into the Marsh family yet, and </span><span>don</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t claim it before</span><span> you </span><span>have</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if you marry into it, there's no way I'm going to be your family. Don't be so </span><span>arrogant</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale was an idiot. Not only was he stupid, but he didn't even know his girlfriend was scheming against him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="82.html">« Prev</a><a href="84.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
