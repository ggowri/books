"Queenie is very good. She stole my design drawings and won first place. I don't deny her excellence. However, can she succeed with a second copy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, this is the Flowers collection I designed for Steven. It includes clothing for all seasons. Without your trick, the collection would have been sold like hot cakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had always been sure of her design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Steven gave you the design drawings so that you could win first place and clear your stain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also understand his love for you. I lost, and I admit it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice and her mood were low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was slightly shocked that Diana mistakenly believed that Steven had given her the design drawings.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained, "Diana, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up." Diana interrupted him icily, "Steven, you always want everything. You both really disgust me to the extreme."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hurtful words made his brain go blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still in a hurry to find Paige. When she was about to leave, Yanson blocked her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, did I allow you to go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana warned coldly, "Get out of the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson liked to play tricks on people. He pointed at Queenie and said, "Apologize to Queenie. How dare you claim that she is a thief? You are incompetent, so you just accused her of plagiarism. Can you have some shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was furious. "Fuck off! Apologize? Why don't you apologize to her? You are seeking death by forcing me to apologize to this bitch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana kicked Yanson hard in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!" He was over six feet tall, but her attack caused him to fall to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked over and stepped on his chest with her high heels in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson felt extremely humiliated. How dare Diana hit him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot, I ignored you before because I valued my marriage to Steven. Now, he is nothing to me. Who the hell do you think you are to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you ask me to apologize? You'd better go back home right now. Your playboy father is about to ruin your company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, I have never offended you, but you insulted me again and again to stand up for Queenie. Well, this time, I won't tolerate it. At 9 o'clock tomorrow morning, I will make the Hastings family's stocks plummet," Diana growled before striding away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sucker like Yanson deserved to be Queenie's pawn. After all, his death was miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all happened so fast that everyone was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the most incredible thing for Yanson. He had always been bullying Diana, but today, he was bullied by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck! Damn it, don't let me meet you next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven approached Yanson and looked at him. "Yanson, from now on, you and I are no longer friends, and all cooperation between us is terminated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson couldn't believe it and stared blankly at the furious Steven, wondering if he was going to break off relations with him just for a country bumpkin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouted, "Steven, are you going to break off relations with me for a country bumpkin?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="847.html">« Prev</a><a href="849.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
