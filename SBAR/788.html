It was one of those rare moments of calm between them since she had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the shadow of Queenie was everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps they really could never go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he selfishly wanted to wait another year.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a year, things would be clearer, and their relationship might improve.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat on the sofa, cradling the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a seat opposite her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you not busy today?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've wrapped up most of my work," he replied. "I thought I'd take some time to spend with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "You don't have to. I'm doing fine on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment had passed; she had once hoped for Steven's company, but he had never been there for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she gazed at the baby, watching him smile, she couldn't help but smile back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little Harlan, you're so adorable! Give me another smile, come on."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven couldn't help but smile at her playful demeanor. Just then, his phone buzzed. He glanced down to see it was Queenie calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering the man she was with, he stood up to take the call outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recognized it was Queenie and felt a wave of calm wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Steven answered, "Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Steven. There's a gala tomorrow night. Can you come with me?" Queenie asked sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven declined. "I have a business trip tomorrow. I can't make it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I'm in the hospital..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care of yourself. After all, a miscarriage can take a toll on your health," he said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? You don't believe me?" Queenie's voice turned panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't the doctor tell me when I brought you in? You're pregnant, but it seems you need a thorough check-up. Don't spread anything to others."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up without another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of coldness flashed in his eyes, feeling no sympathy for Queenie's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already entangled with Levi, and not just him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Diana found him repulsive&mdash;he felt the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning to Diana's room, he instructed Evan to bring in a selection of fruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was about to be discharged from the hospital and had planned to call Steven to test his reaction, but to her surprise, he already knew about her pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he hadn't confronted her about it, had he? He was only upset because she'd been seeing other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario noticed Queenie standing motionless and asked, "Ms. Marsh, are we heading back now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glaring at him, she demanded, "Where's Steven right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario shook his head. "Ms. Marsh, I have no idea where he is."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, she realized that the two men she'd sent to teach Diana a lesson had already been caught.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she had been cautious and left no evidence linking back to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, inform your master that Steven no longer trusts me. He'll need to find another way," Queenie snapped before leaving the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her retreating figure, Mario sighed faintly, thinking to himself, "She really played her winning hand into ruins." Then he replied, "Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie walked towards the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped herself tightly in her coat and headed directly to the underground parking garage.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="787.html">« Prev</a><a href="789.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
