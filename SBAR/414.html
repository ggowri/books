Why was he here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joseph, I heard your grandmother is ill. Do you need any help? I've come especially to see you and your grandmother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jacob offered to help, but his expression was full of mockery, and he didn't seem friendly at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's face was cold. "I don't need your help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joseph, even if you don't love your grandmother, you shouldn't refuse others' kindness. If your grandmother doesn't receive treatment, she will die. As far as I know, your grandmother is the only family you have in this world. Can you really bear to watch her die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're also penniless. What can you use to help me?" Joseph raised an eyebrow. Jacob's presence here was definitely not simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were mortal enemies, often arguing over trivial matters at school. Of course, the troublemaker was always Jacob.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was more excellent than Jacob. Jacob was always unhappy with Joseph and always looked for opportunities to mess with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jacob was no longer wearing cheap clothes for dozens of dollars but was now dressed in brand-name attire. Joseph guessed he must have joined a company and was showing off in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jacob smiled smugly, with one hand in his trouser pocket, his gaze contemptuous and arrogant. "Joseph, you haven't been to school recently, so you probably haven't heard my good news. Our entire team was hired by a well-known company, with a salary of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. I'm now someone you can't afford to associate with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Joseph only found him ridiculous, showing off to him for such a reason. How childish!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey! Joseph, what are you laughing at? What's that look in your eyes? You look down on me?" Jacob raised his voice. He hated Joseph's arrogant demeanor the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph sneered, his manner imposing, "Is this worth you coming to me to show off?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was different. Diana urged him to continue studying and to study hard at the right age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right. My starting point is your finish line. Of course, I have to share this little news with you, so you can envy me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jacob had always been arrogant. Although he was poor, he had a lot of pride. He got to where he was today through his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He and Joseph had similar circumstances. Now that he had achieved something, he naturally wanted to show off and prove that he was more successful than Joseph at a younger age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph's eyes suddenly showed a hint of impatience. "Finished?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jacob hesitated, and then his gaze suddenly froze. He saw Diana's stunning beauty, flawless skin, and exquisite figure. His eyes suddenly brightened. "Joseph, you're really something, being so poor and still having such a beautiful date."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned at him. Jacob's behavior was frivolous and arrogant, making her feel very uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was dressed casually today, in a casual suit with a ponytail, not revealing any status, but her peerless beauty was captivating under the night sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Joseph and said, "Joseph, you go back and take care of your grandmother first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana?" Jacob smiled wickedly, like a bloodhound that had caught a scent. He narrowed his eyes and asked, "Joseph, this isn't the rich woman who's keeping you, is it? This woman is so young, with such good skin and an elegant temperament. She does indeed have the ability to keep you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss, I'm much better than Joseph. Why don't you keep me instead? I will serve you well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph was suddenly furious. How dare Jacob humiliate Diana like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned and suddenly slapped Jacob in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph was stunned.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="413.html">« Prev</a><a href="415.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
