He was too strong; she couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally seizing her chance, Diana bit down hard on Steven's lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain made him stop. His lip quickly swelled up, and seeing Diana's eyes red with fury, he gave a wicked grin. "Diana," he said, his voice a seductive purr, "you're my wife. Are you refusing to fulfill your marital obligations?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana roughly wiped her mouth, her eyes filled with disgust. "Queenie's pregnant, and you can't get your fix from her, so you turn to me? You scumbag! You want me to fulfill my marital obligations? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly rolled off the bed, keeping a safe distance from Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The charged atmosphere instantly dissipated with Diana's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes turned cold, hurt by her look of disgust. His handsome face darkened. "The baby is Levi's. Diana, haven't you been reading the news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at his swollen lip with its faint traces of blood. His gloomy expression held a haunting, broken beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat on the carpet, shouting angrily, "What good is reading the news? Everyone knows about your relationship with her. Even I, your legal wife, know how much you care about your mistress. Now that she's pregnant, you've already wasted so many years of her life. Are you going to waste your child's life too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt her whole being trembling with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he thought she would play the dutiful wife, he could keep dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven furrowed his brow, gazing at her intently. So this was how it felt not to be trusted... it hurt like hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he had refused to trust Diana and wouldn't even let her explain herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Diana didn't trust him and wouldn't listen to his explanations either. The feeling of helplessness and frustration was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, the desire was gone, replaced by an emotionless calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at the glass of milk on the table. "Drink your milk and get some sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned to leave, touching his lip as he stood, "Damn, it stung."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked lazily, a devilish glint in his eye. "Such a fierce little wildcat. But I like it, Diana. Those lips of yours..." He deliberately left the sentence hanging, his voice taking on a playful lilt. "They're so soft."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face instantly flushed hot with anger as she glared at him. If he hadn't been using Tobias to blackmail her, she would've stormed out right then.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flopping onto the bed, Diana felt a wave of despair wash over her. "Why? Why would fate give me a second chance at life, only to put me at the mercy of Steven again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, I can't be greedy," she told herself, taking a deep breath. "Being reborn has already saved me from countless dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Steven, apparently."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered she needed to buy stocks tomorrow - there was one that was about to surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of thinking about Steven, Diana picked up her phone to call Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, calling at this hour - missing me already?" Cecil's voice was playful yet gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Used to his joking nature, Diana said, "Cecil, remember I mentioned taking you stock trading? It's tomorrow. Make sure to sell after three days. I'm putting in two hundred million dollars, and you can invest whatever amount you're comfortable with."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was shocked. "Diana, two hundred million at once? You could lose everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana rolled her eyes. He dared to underestimate her! "Someone once dropped two billion on a single stock. My two hundred million is nothing in comparison. I'll pick you up at 9 AM tomorrow. Are you in or not?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="711.html">« Prev</a><a href="713.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
