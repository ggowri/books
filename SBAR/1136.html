Remembering the question she had just asked Steven, her face instantly went pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did Queenie have to overhear that? Now Queenie would think she was jealous of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie's face was even paler than hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven only treated her well on the surface, and she knew that. But she had been so lost in his kindness that she ignored the details.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no idea that Steven had always looked down on her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven raised an eyebrow when he saw Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why am I running into this woman again?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smirked as she glanced at Diana clinging to Steven's arm. "Diana, you're picking up the man I threw away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! It's not that you dumped Steven; he never wanted you in the first place. You have no right to say I picked up your leftovers. He was mine from the very beginning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cut Queenie off, tightening her grip on Steven's arm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She has no right to say such things</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven never had her in his heart. She has no right to say such things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, what right do you have to say that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's words struck a nerve, tearing open Queenie's wounds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was furious. Her back straightened, but her eyes stayed on Steven. His gaze was cold, devoid of any warmth. It hit her&mdash;Steven truly never had her in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, if you hadn't shown up, everything you have now would be mine. Steven, George&mdash;they were all stepping stones for me. And you... you'd be dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, the humiliation and lies you gave me&mdash;I</span><span>'</span><span>ll remember them well. Just you wait."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie delivered her icy threat and strode toward the car parked not far behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario pulled up, and Queenie yanked the car door open, shooting Diana a venomous glare before getting in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stuck her tongue out at her, making a face. Queenie, fuming, rolled her eyes in frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled. Seeing Queenie angry brought her pure satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go, babe. The more in love we are, the more it'll drive Queenie crazy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her, stunned. Hearing her call him "babe" filled him with joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But realizing those words were just to spite Queenie, his happiness turned to anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, if it's just to spite her, don't bother. I'll just take her out myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since Sandra showed up, I've already dug up everything about her company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smirked. "No, let's take it slow. I want her to lose everything piece by piece. Watching her suffer is the only thing that will make me happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why should I suffer for so long while she gets to go to hell so easily? That wouldn't make me happy. And trust me, if I'm not happy, your life won't be easy either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana murmured softly, "Just wait. I have a feeling things won't be that simple."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt the same, especially when she mentioned Alexander being the ultimate winner. A sense of unease crept into his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them headed straight to the private room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had reserved the private room in advance. By the time they arrived, all the dishes were already served.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the steamed shrimp and all her favorite dishes, she happily took a seat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven poured her a glass of water first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sipped half a glass of water, then used a warm towel to clean her hands. After that, she put on disposable gloves, ready to peel the shrimp.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven stopped her. "Diana, let me do it. You just sit back and enjoy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven moved quickly, placing a peeled shrimp onto her plate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t hold back and ate it right away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of these dishes were actually ones Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t care for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven only ate shrimp if it was already peeled. Seafood wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t really his thing. He preferred beef, especially black pepper steak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t touch anything raw either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The steak had to be well-done, no trace of blood, or he wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t eat it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was definitely not someone who</span><span>'</span><span>d waste time on food.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like peeling shrimp, for instance. This was only the second time she</span><span>'</span><span>d seen him do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first time was on the island, and he</span><span>'</span><span>d peeled them for her then too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana ate happily, and Steven seemed pleased too. After a few big shrimp, Diana was already full.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She found it a bit spicy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shook her head and said, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m done. I</span><span>'</span><span>m full. You should eat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching her enjoy the meal, he smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I had a batch of shrimp flown in. Freshly caught seafood, it'll arrive tomorrow. If you want, you can have it every day."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luna</span><span>'</span><span>s really busy. I</span><span>'</span><span>m planning to hire four chefs to prepare different flavors every day. They</span><span>'</span><span>ll only show up during meals. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sounds good. Luna</span><span>'</span><span>s been working hard, and now she</span><span>'</span><span>s got someone she likes. If she gets married and has kids later, you handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Either way, we can</span><span>'</span><span>t let Luna get too exhausted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When Luna gets married, Diana can assign someone else to stay with her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She wants Luna to get some proper rest. She</span><span>'</span><span>s been through so much over the years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded. "Alright, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll take care of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lowered his head, eating with effortless grace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had lost her appetite, so she just watched him eat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t like talking while eating. Sometimes, when he was busy, he</span><span>'</span><span>d review documents as he ate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What kind of scene was it, pairing gourmet food with documents? She had witnessed it countless times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he was always so focused. After reading, he could even go over everything again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a business prodigy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren</span><span>'</span><span>t for Charlie and his father</span><span>'</span><span>s schemes, no one could ever defeat him in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Jeff hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t swapped her, maybe things would</span><span>'</span><span>ve turned out differently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana rested her head on her hand, watching Steven eat with such grace. Her face was filled with admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze was so intense that it made Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s usually smooth eating movements a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked up, meeting Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes. With a slight smile, he asked, </span><span>"</span><span>Diana, what are you staring at?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, "You</span><span>'</span><span>re handsome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s ears turned red instantly. Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t say this often, but whenever she did, it was with absolute sincerity. To her, he truly was incredibly handsome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then take your time watching, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll keep eating." The food here really suited his taste. The black pepper steak was especially well done.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he lowered his head, Steven smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He liked the way Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s gaze focused solely on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time she looked at him, her entire world seemed to revolve around him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this world, she was the only one who would look at him with such unwavering focus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he wouldn't let such an amazing woman slip away again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lifted his gaze, meeting Diana's radiant smile. "Diana, once you forgive me, let</span><span>'</span><span>s have another wedding. I want to give you the grand celebration you deserve."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Diana could respond, the door to the private room swung open. Alexander's tall, commanding figure stepped inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flicker of murderous intent flashed in Steven's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gasped in surprise, "Alexander, what are you doing here?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1135.html">« Prev</a><a href="1137.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
