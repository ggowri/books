He stood up, hugged Diana excitedly, and spun her around three times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said unhappily, "Elroy, how dare you hug my wife. Stop it right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy made a face but still put Diana down. "Mr. Gellar, there are many kinds of hugs. This is a hug of gratitude. Don't be jealous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's lunchtime now. I had someone bring the local specialty lunch from the foot of the mountain. The lamb here is incredibly delicious. After we finish the lamb, let's give it our all to complete the race."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy was very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's great. Mr. Morrison is so generous today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Awesome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His team members were all very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy looked at Diana and thought she was so beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Too bad she's married.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana really liked this atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was also very passionate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over, pulled Diana into his arms, and domineeringly said, "Honey, don't get close to them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought his jealous look was quite cute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go check the track, wait for me here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her and said, "Didn't you say you wanted me to watch you race? I can't see from here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and said, "This track has ninety-nine turns, are you sure you can handle it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven really couldn't handle it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that after getting out of the car, he might not even be able to straighten his back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn&rsquo;t want him to endure that hardship. It wasn&rsquo;t something an average person could handle. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a recording inside. Give me your phone, I&rsquo;ll help you install an app. That way, you can watch me race on your phone.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The racing speed will be very fast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at the mountain's curves and firmly said, "No, I want to go with you once, at least once."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy patted Steven's shoulder and advised, "Mr. Gellar, I suggest you better not try. I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven interrupted him, "What makes you think you can sit next to Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven is so domineering and jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy smiled, "Fine. You take the passenger seat, I won't fight you for it. After you experience it, you'll feel worse than death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, not everyone can handle the thrill of extreme speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said, "If you take the passenger seat, where do I sit?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pointed to the simple sofa behind him and said, "Let Diana install some software for you, and you can sit here and watch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy frowned and said, "Steven, this is serious. It's Diana's first time in this race, I have to be with her. This is not the time for your jealousy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at him deeply and said, "I'm not jealous of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at them and said helplessly, "Stop arguing. Elroy, join me in the second round."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy compromised. "Alright! I'll find the track manager to clear the way for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Elroy returned. Diana took them to see her race car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the silver top-tier sports car, Elroy got emotional and cried again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently stroked the race car, feeling his soul resonate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is just so cool!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven and said, "Get in the passenger seat, buckle up, and put on the helmet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took a deep breath and said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy looked at Steven mockingly and said, "Mr. Gellar, good luck!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy's teammates also shouted, "Mr. Gellar, good luck."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt helpless and didn't think it was a big deal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled at Elroy and said, "See you in a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy smirked and said, "See you in a bit, Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was very gentle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting in the car, Diana put on her gloves, looked at Steven, and asked, "Are you ready? If you're ready, we'll set off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her, fastened his seatbelt, and then said, "I'm ready, Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana fastened her seatbelt and started the car. The race car engine suddenly roared deafeningly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, the turbocharger let out a high-pitched whine, and the engine rumbled deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The red warning lights on the dashboard turned off one by one. Oil pressure, oil temperature, and tire pressure data flickered rapidly on the LCD screen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pressed the clutch deeply and quickly shifted the gear lever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment she released the clutch, the car shot out like an arrow, soaring like a silver dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rapid speed made Steven uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The seatbelt pressed against his chest, making him feel suffocated. At the moment of acceleration, the back-and-forth jolt made him feel as if his organs were vibrating violently with the engine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the race car entered the first curve, the body tilted almost 90 degrees, and Steven felt like vomiting at the very first turn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven still looked at Diana. She wore a safety helmet, and her eyes were exceptionally clear and bright. She stared straight ahead like a falcon, able to catch every detail on the track.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her every move was seamless, as if she had become one with the race car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana seemed like a completely different person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she was radiant and dazzling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the lounge, the big screen showed the entire track.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said in surprise, "Diana is amazing. Look at that terrifying drift, it's even more thrilling than the engine sound."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A team member said, "Mr. Morrison, with Mrs. Gellar joining our team and Mr. Gellar's investment, can our team really make it to the World Championship in the future?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy laughed recklessly and said, "Steven is extremely wealthy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whether domestically or abroad, he has investment markets. He was able to get the car here so quickly because of his connections overseas."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team member said enviously, "Mr. Morrison, you're also from a wealthy family, so why is there such a big gap between you and him? Our team still has to spend money so cautiously."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy said unhappily, "You're so rude."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1163.html">« Prev</a><a href="1165.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
