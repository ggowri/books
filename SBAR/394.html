No wonder she dislikes Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, your parents are so kind, but they adopted an ungrateful person. Don't worry. I won't allow Diana to bully you. Next time, I will teach her a lesson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled gently and nodded. Her bright, innocent, big eyes were full of admiration. "Levi, thank you for your support. Let's go. Don't be upset about my affairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She deliberately pretended to be well-behaved and docile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Levi gazed at her with his heart pounding, thinking that she was pretty tender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay!" His voice gradually became soft.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie grew arrogant. Levi, part of the Robinson family, was wealthy and influential. If he fell in love with her, she would have endless resources in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They entered the restaurant, still talking and laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Not far away, Evan, who had come out to buy dinner for Steven, saw everything.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was shocked by Queenie's acting skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Levi was bewitched by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was so scheming that Evan really couldn't afford to offend her. He had already realized that she planned to deal with him and kill him because he had always helped Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He returned to the hotel with the meal. Steven was very busy tonight and had been in a meeting in the meeting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Paige left the restaurant. Paige almost cried with anger. Even with tears in her eyes, she tried to smile, "Diana, Queenie is so scary. Why can't anyone see through her despicable tricks?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled, "Her disguise blinds others. Moreover, she appears pitiful with a pale face and tearful eyes. A weak woman can always arouse men's most primitive desire to protect her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face was her trump card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But she is too bullying and annoying. No wonder Frank was almost killed." Paige still felt annoyed at the thought of what had just happened.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wasn't this the method used by a female supporting role in a romantic drama?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She rolled down the stairs and framed the heroine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh! Diana, I remember Steven hating you the most when Queenie fell down the stairs to frame you. Did she watch too many romantic dramas and imitate the vicious female supporting roles in them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing that her tears streamed down, Diana grinned and patted her shoulder. "Paige, don't be sad. The past is in the past. Steven and I are not destined to be together, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are no threat to Queenie. As long as you are not with me, she will not plot against you. She only plans to target me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had always wanted to drag Diana down to hell. For some reason, Queenie really hated her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because of Steven? But she didn't love him that much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was very worried about Diana. "Diana, Steven easily falls for Queenie's tricks. We can't afford to offend her in the future, so let's stay away from her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was well aware that she couldn't avoid Queenie's attack, but in order to reassure Paige, she smiled, "Sure! Let's stay away from her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana seemed relaxed and obedient. Paige felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, Diana. Let's go to another restaurant. I'll take you over there to eat barbecue. It's just as delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as they didn't meet Queenie, all the dishes would be tasty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I really want to ask Steven if he feels any guilt towards you about cheating on you."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="393.html">« Prev</a><a href="395.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
