"Impossible, she couldn't have known."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in disbelief, unable to fathom that Paula could possibly be privy to her scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, sometimes you're just too full of yourself. But it's alright; I'll help you find the technical expertise you need. Our project kicks off next spring, and we'll recoup all your losses by then," he reassured her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie murmured, "Okay, but what about Steven? He doesn't trust me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worry too much. If he won't have you, there are others. You're my woman, and I don't want you marrying him. Don't fret; I know he doesn't trust you, and I've already sent other women to get close to him. He'll be defenseless."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the words "you're my woman" reached her ears, Queenie felt her heart leaping with an overwhelming surge of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When will you be back?" she asked, missing him dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the day Steven dies. I have a plan, Queenie, and I need your help to see it through."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me," Queenie responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana stirred from her slumber, the world outside was bathed in the soft light of a new day. Yet, upon noticing the grey, overcast sky unleashing a gentle rain, she allowed her eyelids to flutter shut once more. It was the perfect kind of day for a lazy morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A knock on the door interrupted her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up, assuming it was Althea and Paige, who perhaps felt hungry and called her for breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She happily slipped into her shoes and opened the door, only to be slightly taken aback by Steven's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven appeared as though he hadn't rested well; his sleep seemed troubled, evidenced by the subtle shade lingering beneath his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked tired and slightly disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised. "You didn't go home last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then remembered this was his domain, where he had his own room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Steven replied with a soft nod, his deep voice tinged with allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven held up the breakfast in his hand. "Let's have breakfast together. I've already arranged something for your friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been craving a plate of spaghetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven added, "I got you spaghetti."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in, then. It's not like we can't have breakfast together."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She returned quickly to find Steven had laid out breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she sat down, Steven offered her a glass of milk. "Drink this first, then eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" Diana enjoyed milk and yogurt, and Steven had catered to her preferences.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained, "I'm here for an inspection and will be staying temporarily, next door to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, understanding the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drinking half the milk, Diana began eating her spaghetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had opted for a sandwich with an egg, while Diana had the same egg, which was meticulously stored away in an additional plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven harbored concerns that the food might be so greasy that she wouldn't be able to stomach it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana immediately realized Steven had personally bought the breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the realization dawned on her, and with urgency, she inquired, "Did you actually buy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven confirmed. "Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How rare!" Diana was genuinely surprised. Steven had never cared for her before, yet here he was, buying her breakfast. How could this not be rare?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven raised an eyebrow, looking at her. "What's so rare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pointed at the spaghetti, saying, "This is a treat Queenie used to have. Now, I do, too. What do you want from me by buying me this delicious food, Mr. Gellar? Or perhaps you're expecting me to apologize to Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, is that really how you interpret my actions?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="778.html">« Prev</a><a href="780.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
