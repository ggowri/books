"Isn't this how you've always been? You usually play humble when there's something you want me to do. Isn't that your usual trick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was at a loss for words. Reflecting on the past, he always hoped Diana would apologize to Queenie, after all, he thought it was Diana's mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, this time I won't ask you to do anything," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Steven turned back to his spaghetti, he suddenly realized it didn't taste good anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath and said, "Steven, please stop doing these things. You need to understand that the person you love is Queenie. You think I'm dull and uninteresting, that I don't know how to dress up, but let me clarify something.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not dull and uninteresting. I'm lively and cheerful by nature, but you like quiet, so I've toned it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say I don't know how to dress; I wore pretty dresses twice, and you criticized me for wearing too little, lacking the composure. Plus, during those two years, I was busy taking care of you and studying for my exams, so I admit I didn't put much effort into my appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, I thought you didn't know how to love. You were just a bit distant. But later, I saw you pour your heart into preparing gifts for Queenie and unconditionally trust and favor her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's when I realized you did know how to love, and you loved Queenie in a way that made everyone around you envious. They envied Queenie for having such a devoted and wealthy fianc&eacute;. It was then I understood that you just didn't love me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I loved you in the same way you love Queenie, giving you my affection, tolerating your indifference, and indulging your hurtful behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes began to glisten with tears. "Steven, I can confirm at this moment that you've never loved me. The only person you love is Queenie. You've filled your heart and mind with her, doing everything for her. So, Steven, we can truly get a divorce now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Continuing this entanglement isn't good for any of us. Think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked seriously at Steven. He and Queenie could love each other however they pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just wanted to live her life freely and happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were legally separated, her future could be bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven set down his fork, aware of the seriousness of her expression and the irrevocable nature of their past.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked earnestly, "Is there really no chance for us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." Diana nodded slightly. "There's no chance for us, Steven. The pain you've caused me, I can't forget."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew she wanted to talk things through; he wanted that too. "I favored Queenie because she and her father deceived me, claiming she saved me from a fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I defended her because of that life-saving grace and our childhood together. But your grandfather told me you were the one who saved me back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, I later realized she took advantage of our childhood bond. Diana, I've realized my mistakes. Give me another chance; I promise I won't disappoint you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sincerely apologized, feeling he owed Diana many apologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had already heard about this from Leopold and was surprised he had approached Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head. "No need. I know you'll let me down again because the only person in your heart is Queenie. Steven, admitting that you love Queenie won't diminish your dignity. You're so pathetic. Is it really so hard to admit your love for her?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="779.html">« Prev</a><a href="781.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
