"I know how much you love your parents. They're the ones in this world who care for you most, who forgive you unconditionally. Don't make them go through the pain of losing you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to wake up soon. Your parents need you now more than ever. Mark is already working on their estate. I'm telling you this because I want you to have a reason to keep fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what you went through that night, time will help you let go of it all eventually."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched as Lily's eyelids fluttered once more, but she still showed no signs of waking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing it was time, she gave Lily a pill and then left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah was scheduled for surgery today, and as she left, she noticed Tom wasn't around.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana headed directly from the hospital to the market. She bought some ribs, a whole chicken, and lots of vegetables. The market had no heating, and she shivered as the cold seeped through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the car, she glanced in the rearview mirror to find her nose bright red, her hands stiff from the chill. She got herself a cup of hot chocolate, and after a sip, she felt warmth spread through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down at the cup, she thought maybe it was the weather, but this hot chocolate seemed especially comforting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few sips, Diana started driving home, ready to make dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had messaged her, saying he'd be home for dinner tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant she had to go out and buy groceries. Steven didn't like having servants around, so a lot of things fell on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "What's with this weird quirk? Can't he use things other people have touched?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A little annoyed, she let her mind wander on the drive back to the villa. When she pulled up to the house, she noticed a car she didn't recognize parked out front.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not thinking much of it, she parked in the garage and gathered up the bags of groceries.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the load, it didn't bother her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she stepped inside, she heard Owen's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven rarely brought friends home, so hearing Owen's voice surprised her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I never thought you'd move here. These villas are nearly impossible to buy&mdash;how did you get one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting on the couch, Steven gave him a calm look and replied, "Because you didn't offer enough. I paid double."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Double?!" Owen was stunned. "That must have cost a few hundred million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression remained steady. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen sat there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He marveled at Steven's wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had wanted one of these villas himself, but they were never available.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked at Steven's words, surprised that he had paid double just so they could live here together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "He's insane. If he has that much to spare, why not donate more to charity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tossed her keys onto the entryway table with a loud clatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the bags in her hands, Steven quickly got up to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't refuse; the bags were heavy, and holding them for too long would get tiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed to the kitchen and said, "Just take it all in there. I'll go change and be down to start dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her warmly. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked across the living room without greeting Owen. Both he and Yanson had always looked down on her, and they'd insulted her for Queenie's sake more than once before. With their spoiled attitudes, she didn't feel the need to play polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't think they deserved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her walk past without a word, Owen knew why Diana ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she likely despised him, considering he had never seen her as anything more than an annoyance. If it weren't for Steven, he might've said even harsher things.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had met Queenie first, and he was well aware of how much Steven had once cared for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, he'd been on Queenie's side back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he wasn't about to force any friendliness with Diana now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven returned, Owen got up and said, "I'd better head out."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stopped him. "Hold on. There's something I need to discuss."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen slouched back into his seat with a lazy grin. "What's up?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="742.html">« Prev</a><a href="744.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
