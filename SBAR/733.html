"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was momentarily stunned by Steven's icy demeanor. Reluctantly, he asked, "Mr. Gellar, aren't you going to help Ms. Marsh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven remained silent and motionless, fixing Mario with a cold stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not daring to antagonize Steven further, Mario had no choice but to head to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his haste, he'd forgotten one crucial detail - Diana would also be summoned to the station.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario rushed toward the elevator, determined to reach the station first.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven called Evan over.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, are we heading to the police station?" Evan asked as soon as he entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave him a slight nod. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's face lit up with a grin. "Well... Mr. Gellar, you're finally letting Mrs. Gellar into your heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Evan's cheerful expression, Steven felt a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never indeed given Diana a chance, so what right did he have to let her sacrifice everything for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he saw others treating her right that he realized how wrong he'd been.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt uneasy, finding Evan's smile particularly irritating.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze turned dark and unfathomable. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Diana took Luna to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance, they ran into Mario, who shot her an icy glare. "Diana, you actually had the nerve to call the cops? Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Queenie isn't someone you can mess with. Drop the charges right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hadn't even said a word before Mario started throwing threats around.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow at him. This guy was really Queenie's faithful lapdog.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was freezing today. She wore a white down jacket, her hair pulled back in a ponytail, with light makeup that enhanced her natural beauty. Her smile revealed perfect teeth and sparkling eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied coolly, "Mario, are you really threatening me right outside the police station? And who exactly is Queenie? The mistress, or just Levi's latest fling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Mario started, but Diana cut him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't Queenie just another regular person? Or does she think she's some kind of princess who needs to be worshipped?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario spotted some officers approaching and shut up, though he was seething with murderous rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave him one last cold glance before walking inside. She found Queenie in the interrogation room, sitting comfortably in the heated space, though her eyes gleamed with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Queenie spotted Diana, her face contorted with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you dare have me arrested?" she snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana brushed the snow off her shoulders and said with a smile, "You should've seen this coming when you tried to trash my reputation online. What's wrong? You can dish it out but can't take it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was taken aback. Diana had changed! She'd become confident and beautiful, radiating with an inner glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stuck her chin out defiantly and shouted, "Where's your proof?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? The mountain of online posts where people watched you drag my name through the mud! Those are all evidence. Every word you said in public is evidence. Don't you know how the law works?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie faltered. She'd been so focused on smearing Diana that she hadn't thought about the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes darkened. "Queenie, you had a good life. Why did you have to try and drag me to hell with you? I left to give you what you wanted. What more do you want from me?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you stare into the abyss, it stares back at you. While you were trying to knock me off my pedestal, you fell into that same darkness."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Diana venomously. "Just wait, Diana. Steven will be here any minute to bail me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without my agreement to settle, what can he possibly do?" Diana sat down next to her with a swagger and grabbed her wrist to check her pulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Queenie struggled to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana snapped, "Stop moving."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't stay still - if Diana discovered her pregnancy, everything would unravel.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana held her wrist firmly. After a minute, she let go and said in surprise, "My God, you really are pregnant! It's almost fourteen days along."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="732.html">« Prev</a><a href="734.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
