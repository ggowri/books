Living in that environment, she thought these tactics were normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she had woken up, she realized just how vile her son's actions were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula grew angrier the more she thought about it. She walked over and looked at Jeff, who appeared to be in pain. "Jeff, you cheating in my house was bad enough. Now you're using your 'illness' to avoid going to work, and your small business is about to collapse. Just look at your test results! The doctor said you're fine aside from hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or is it that you don't want to give your parents the $10,000?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff paused, avoiding Paula's angry, exhausted gaze. "Paula, that's not true," he mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not true? I heard everything from the doorway. Didn't I transfer $100,000 to your account? I've been busy and asked you to give it to your parents, but you didn't?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They're your parents. I've treated them like my own for years. No matter how tough business was, I made sure to deposit $100,000 into their account every month. Do the math. How much has that been over 20 years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I gave you the money, so you should give it to your mom. How could you let her doubt my intentions?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're their son. How could you do something that breaks her heart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff paused, realizing that Paula had given him $100,000 a few days earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was supposed to give it to his parents, but he forgot and gave it to Queenie's mother instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I&hellip; I forgot. Honey, I'll give it to Mom tomorrow," Jeff stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey frowned at her son. How could he forget? She reminded him about the money every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey suddenly felt that her son wasn't as good to her as he used to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jeff, I've gotten used to that money. Without it, it's like my blood is being drained. You must give it to me tomorrow," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff nodded irritably. "Fine, Mom. I'll give it to you tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satisfied, Tracey went back to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula turned to leave, but Jeff called out, "Paula, where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula turned back and sneered. "Don't think I want to stay in this house. Have you forgotten about what happened at Mr. Foliot's banquet so soon? Jeff, you can't have it all. Think about your situation. Don't push things to the point where nobody can save face."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula finally said what she had wanted to, "You're already tainted!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff's eyes widened, glaring at Paula. "Paula, I&hellip; I was set up by Diana!" he insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was explained clearly that day. I don't get it. Why are you blaming Diana for this? Because you think she's easy to bully?" Paula shot back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, Paula, she's also our daughter, but she set me up&hellip;" Jeff argued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hah! Jeff, stop making excuses. I'm glad I don't recognize that woman, but if I did, I'd suspect the two of you had a thing going on," Paula retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was always good at creating conflict, wasn't he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, she'd use his own tactics against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey valued money more than life, and Jeff's tough days were just beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll be staying at the office for now. You can take care of your parents yourself. And by the way, your company just lost a few projects. In business, you need to leave something for others, or you'll find yourself targeted," Paula warned.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="306.html">« Prev</a><a href="308.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
