He was interested after reading it, the anchor of their company would be appointed, and they would get one percent more of the profits. Since it was a win-win strategy, Alexander agreed to sign on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt pity and looked at Diana appreciatively. "Diana, if you had told me earlier that you were a designer, I wouldn't sit here today with Mr. Watson and negotiate a partnership."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "I remember that I told you that when we first met."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't sure if he believed it or not. Anyway, she had told him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her with affection. She was truly brilliant, and she looked innocent when she smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry that I was so busy since I just came back home, so I just forgot about it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan smiled elegantly, "Mr. Powell, you are not allowed to take away the staff from my company. Diana is the senior designer in our company, and with Diana around, </span><span>you don't have to worry about the design because she has a constant source of inspiration."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Nolan who complimented her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just loved to hear what Nolan had said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned to the last page of the contract. "Don't worry, I'm not Steven who went straight to your company to take someone away. He did go too far in order to force Diana out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had poached the entire design department, leaving her as the lone designer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought </span><span>s</span><span>he couldn't possibly do anything now!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what he didn't know was her company's been carrying dead weight, and now they've all jumped ship to Steven's company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to Steven's foolish actions, Diana hired new people with attractive benefits.</span><span> </span><span>She had successfully handled the issues in the design department.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other departments began to settle down as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had weeded out the bad apples, keeping only those she deemed competent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was truly grateful to Steven for his actions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven heard this as he pushed the door open, and his eyes suddenly became somber. He just wanted Diana to go home without forcing her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This bad guy, Alexander, had taken the opportunity to badmouth him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked somber, pushing the door open forcefully and stepping inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander and Nolan were signing the contract.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three had different expressions when they saw </span><span>Steven walk</span><span> in angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was furious, thinking, "What's he doing here again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why do I keep seeing him lately?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had always wished for him to come home before the divorce, but her wish would just be an extravagant hope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It couldn't possibly be expected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander signed his name and handed it to Nolan. "Mr. Watson, I've signed it. I hope we can work well together."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan smiled </span><span>elegantly,</span><span> his tone gentle. "Mr. Powell, thank you for your trust. It's a pleasure to work with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Penelope, who followed them in, were shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why was Alexander also here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, both of them said it was a pleasure to work together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked upset and thought, "Damn it! Diana turned out to be over here to sign the contract."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why was this bumpkin here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn't realize that Diana was now a costume designer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over and sat beside Diana, a powerful aura spreading out from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and asked, "Mr. Gellar, what's the matter with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her with indifferent eyes. "Nothing, I just happened to see you when I was passing by, so I came over to say hello."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did he just so happen to pass by? She wasn't on the street but sitting in a private room, so how could he just happen to be here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie frowned and thought, "Was Steven concerned about Diana's mood?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said apologetically, "I'm sorry, Mr. Gellar. We're about to eat, so please leave us alone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was obviously trying to drive him away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes were grim. Diana was trying to drive him away, and he suppressed the anger in his mind as he asked, "When are you coming home? I'll come pick you up."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="84.html">« Prev</a><a href="86.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
