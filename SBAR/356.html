I will come to you tomorrow and let's go on a date. I'm going to the bar tonight. Please be careful on your way back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, he ran away with a smile. From his back, Diana could tell that he was in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. It seemed that Cecil had misunderstood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa always causes misunderstandings." Diana sighed, not noticing someone approaching her from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hanging up the phone, she put the phone back in her bag and raised her eyes. Suddenly, she was surprised because of a familiar fragrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had lived together with that man for two years, and she was familiar with this fragrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned around and met Steven's gloomy eyes, which seemed as if he wanted to tear her into pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a step back in fear. She had seen Steven like this in her previous life when he wanted to kill someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She swallowed, wondering if he wanted to kill her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Diana could finish her words, Steven grabbed her hand tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana opened her eyes wide and struggled, but failed to break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's hands were very hot, and the scorching heat spread throughout Diana's body, making her nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her with angry eyes. "Come back with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words were brief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at him coldly. "Steven, you asked me to go back with you. Aren't you afraid that Queenie will be jealous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It has nothing to do with me." He was nice to Queenie because she rescued him from the fire at that time, but now he knew that the person who rescued him was Diana, not Queenie. Queenie had been taking advantage of Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was very surprised. Looking at Steven, she felt a grievance in her heart. "How come it has nothing to do with you? You unconditionally believed her and bullied me with the Marrsh family. Now you said it had nothing to do with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven did not deny it. He did not like Diana but only felt grateful to her. He did not know how to love and no one told him what love was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had been together for two years, but he still didn't understand his feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You were very unlucky at that time." Steven's eyes were filled with regret. "I was very busy at that time. I had just taken over the Gellar Group and it was very chaotic. There were a lot of things in the company every day..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop talking, Steven. That's not a reason for you to bully me." Diana interrupted him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at her without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at her wrist. It hurt and felt hot. She hated this kind of contact. "Steven, let me go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come back with me. You are still my wife. I will never allow you to be with other men and cheat on me. It's a shame for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven dragged Diana towards the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a huge gap in strength between men and women. Diana was no match for Steven at all. She could only be dragged and stumbled into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven carried Diana into the car. She had no strength to fight back at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Queenie went downstairs, she saw Steven dragging Diana into the car and leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes were full of hatred, thinking," Steven, why don't you love me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She created opportunities many times to test Steven's bottom line. At this moment, she suddenly felt that she had gone too far, and Steven would never believe her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could no longer control Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now Steven regarded Diana as more important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was very angry. The more she wanted to hold on to something, the easier it was to lose it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No way. Steven, you are my bargaining chip. I won't give you away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes were full of hatred. She asked Mario to pick her up. Then she went to Steven's villa.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="355.html">« Prev</a><a href="357.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
