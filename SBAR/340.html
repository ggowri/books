She had never underestimated her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil had fallen victim to his arrogance; Diana hoped Rita wouldn't do the same.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, the cars ahead started moving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana switched lanes and quickly got onto the ring highway. She was now very worried about Luna.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was in the passenger seat, feeling slightly uneasy at the high speed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Diana's driving was steady, with no sudden braking.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glanced sideways at her. Her cool gaze and smooth skin were alluring under the moonlight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This version of Diana felt unfamiliar to him. In the two years she'd been by his side, she'd been so ordinary.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was always busy, but it was cooking that occupied her time. Whenever he returned home, he'd find her working in the kitchen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this side of Diana was unsettling to him. He preferred the old Diana, whose eyes were always on him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would prepare dinner and a late-night meal every day, waiting for him to come home from work. He seldom ate at social events because he knew there'd be delicious food waiting for him at home, made by Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the six months since she'd left, his appetite had worsened, and he frequently suffered from stomach pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven found it strange. When she was ordinary, he thought she was dull and boring.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now that she had become formidable, he longed for her to return to her simple self, with eyes only for him. That's when he felt truly happy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On many nights, the warm light in the kitchen had been a comfort to his lonely heart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, come back home with me tonight," Steven said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was focused on how to rescue Luna when Steven's sudden remark annoyed her. "I'm not going. Don't distract me while I'm driving."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Luna's location got closer, Diana's heart grew increasingly tense.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, she was near Luna's phone location, and police cars surrounded the area.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana quickly pulled the car to the side and parked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She opened the door and got out, running at full speed toward Nolan, standing nearby. "Nolan, where's Luna?" she asked anxiously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan pointed toward an abandoned building not far away. "Diana, Luna is hanging from that building. The rescue team is already on it, so don't worry."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked up and saw a figure swaying in the cold wind. Her face turned red with anger, but luckily, the rescue team had managed to bring Luna down safely.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Nolan ran into the abandoned building.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was on the fourth floor that they finally saw Luna.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Luna," Diana called, rushing over. The night in the outskirts was already quite cold.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna's hands and feet were freezing. Diana grabbed her hand and looked at her pale face, whispering, "Luna..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was frozen and shivering. "Diana, I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I uploaded the video to the cloud. Did you see it?" she asked, her voice trembling.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded. "Yes, I saw it. Thanks to you, Cecil will be fine."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna smiled. "That's good!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a wave of sadness. "You're still able to smile. Doesn't it hurt?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, it doesn't hurt. I can still move my hands, just a muscle strain in my arm. A few days' rest will be enough," Luna reassured.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was about to ask how Luna had been found, but the police arrived.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Perez, can you identify the people who kidnapped you?" asked one of the officers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna shook her head. "As soon as I stepped out, they put a bag over my head, so I couldn't see who brought me here."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, we'll review the surveillance footage in the area. For now, you should go to the hospital. We'll notify you once the investigation results are out," the officer said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana led Luna away, instructing Nolan to leave first, as she couldn't let Steven discover Nolan's identity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Azure Group was her strongest support and her last hope, and the company's performance was rapidly rising.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana helped Luna back to the car.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna spotted Steven, and her expression turned cold.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, why is he here? He's the one who brought people," Luna said, her tone icy.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="339.html">« Prev</a><a href="341.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
