Are you okay?" His voice was somewhat cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine, I'm having dinner. You just focus on your class."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph said, "Great! I'm glad to hear that you're fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Don't worry. No one can bully me," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Joseph had a delightful conversation before hanging up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven put down his fork, looked at her smiling face, and asked with a frown, "Why is he so concerned about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you not allowing others to care about me?" she asked, her gaze cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, meeting her cold and unfamiliar gaze, felt as if something had pricked his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did not mean that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you have no right to interfere in my life. The only reason I'm sitting here is because of your threat. My elder brother will become strong one day," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she lowered her head to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "Oh, by the way, since you don't acknowledge the child as yours, Queenie might continue to pester you. I think you should recognize the responsibility you need to take sooner rather than later."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana unlocked her phone and played Queenie's words for Steven to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen carefully. Queenie said the child is yours. Steven, do you know how adorable a child is? How can you let your child be subject to gossip?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By doing this, Steven should agree to divorce her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Steven said nothing and focused on eating. After taking a few bites of cabbage, he said, "Send me a copy of the recording."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him with a tacit smile. "I understand. After all, it's the voice of your beloved, and you want to listen to it several times every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was shocked by her thoughts and couldn't help but choke.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her mischievous gaze instantly doused the anger that had flared up within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your mind filled with this kind of nonsense all the time?" Steven gritted his teeth, holding back his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sent him the recording and then said, "Of course, I spent all day thinking about how to get a divorce from you. Queenie keeps sending me evidence, which makes me very happy. If she knew that I was living with you, I think I could get rid of you next."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stopped talking as she was getting angrier. She had gone through so much trouble to cook a meal, and she refused to let it be ruined because of Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for why she dared to say such things, it was because she truly feared nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already died once, and she couldn't let herself be too stifled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking her mind was what she wanted to do. In her previous life, because of her forbearance, her ultimate fate was truly tragic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana just buried her head in the food and devoured it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, who was in a bad mood, originally had no appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her eating with such relish, he regained his appetite. He was living in pain, and he had thought about letting her go, but he knew that without the constraint of their marriage, once Diana left, she would never return to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men around her were all excellent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he only had her!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven ate silently; he had grown accustomed to her cooking, which was better than that of the restaurants outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finished dinner in silence. Diana quietly cleared the table and then went to the kitchen to wash the dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her go to the kitchen, then he went upstairs and dialed Queenie's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven!" He heard Queenie's surprised voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven said coldly, "Did you tell Diana that you're pregnant with my child?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="707.html">« Prev</a><a href="709.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
