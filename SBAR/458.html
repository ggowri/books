"Mom, are you seriously taking her side? We were doing just fine before Diana showed up. Ever since she came into the picture, nothing's been the same. She's like a curse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, maybe she's unlucky but only because you all made her life hell. Eric, maybe it's time you felt what it's like to be pushed around and falsely accused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's not a single decent person in the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, would you mind leaving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words struck him like ice, and he started to panic, reaching for her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's gotten into you? You never liked Diana before! Why are you suddenly defending her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I've realized I was wrong. It's this family that's rotten. Diana is the only one with any decency around here. From now on, don't call me your mother. I'm not interested in having a son like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sighed, closing her eyes in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she'd failed with her sons, and there was no undoing that now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late for regrets, but the least she could do was protect what was left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so hung up on Queenie? Go on. Keep being her puppet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom! How could you say that about Queenie? She's... she's my sister. If it's because of Diana, I'll deal with her myself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula, fed up, slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, get out! You're nearly thirty and still mooching off the family, doing nothing with your life. Your father wanted you to chase your dreams, and how'd that turn out? Wasted time, wasted chances. And did you accomplish anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A real parent doesn't let their kids waste their lives. But every time I tried to straighten you out, you complained that I didn't love you. Well, look at you now. Is this the life you wanted? Fine. I've done my part in raising you. I'm done trying to fix things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need a son who's only good at tearing other people down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice cracked with disappointment. Of all her sons, only the eldest had any sense left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was exhausted, defeated. It was too late to protect anyone, least of all her own daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric gave a bitter laugh, convinced that Paula's resentment was really aimed at Jeff. "If you don't want me, Dad will..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, please, go right ahead. I'm sure he and his girlfriend will be thrilled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I heard that was Diana's doing. She's the one who set Dad up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, use your head for once. If Queenie told you to jump off a cliff, would you do it? I saw it happen with my own eyes. Your father walked into that situation willingly. And you're still trying to pin it on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, that whole 'kidnapping' of Queenie's? She staged it herself and blamed Diana. Gale's car accident? Arranged by her. Frank going missing? Queenie's handiwork. She even hired Elsie to seduce him, pulling him away from his business until he lost it all. And where's his company now? In your father's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have nothing left, Eric. Queenie's only keeping you around to do her dirty work with Diana. Once you're out of the way, she'll come after me next, and then your dad can have his happy ending with Queenie's real mother."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="457.html">« Prev</a><a href="459.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
