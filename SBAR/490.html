It almost drove me mad. None of this would be happening if you'd just left her out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff, clearly irritated, retorted, "Do you think I honestly wanted to bring that spoiled girl back? If Queenie hadn't ditched Steven after his accident, I wouldn't have been forced into this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie was so irresponsible. If she'd stayed back then, she'd have Mrs. Gellar's position by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If my company hadn't been tied to Steven's, I'd have lost everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I had no idea what Mr. Edward Gellar was thinking back then. Once he learned Diana was the real Marsh family's heiress, he insisted she marry Steven. I still don't understand why he did that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bringing Diana back was my only choice. But I've already kicked her out, and Steven will divorce her soon. I won't let Diana block Queenie's path. Our daughter only deserves the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie felt bitter whenever she thought about the two decades she'd spent hidden in the shadows. She scoffed, "Diana and Paula owe me so much. It's only because my daughter caught Steven's eye that their company's been so successful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter has Steven's attention now. Once you get that divorce, I'll be the mother-in-law of the richest man around," she said with a smug grin, thoroughly pleased with herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff chimed in, "Alright, alright. Actually, we hit a snag&mdash;Steven can't divorce Diana just yet. Now that Eric's back, I'm planning to use him against Diana. That idiot's so heartless he'd even throw his own sister into another man's bed. He's an utter jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana despises Eric. If those two end up tearing each other apart, Queenie will have an even better shot at getting close to Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our biggest obstacle now is those two old fossils in the Gellar family. They only recognize Diana as their granddaughter-in-law, not our Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was actually the real challenge. Jeff had been plotting ways to turn Diana into his sharpest weapon against Helen and Edward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, Jeff hadn't had the chance, but with Helen not feeling well recently, he felt that an opportunity was on the horizon. But he couldn't act on his own&mdash;he needed Amelie to handle it. Steven's </span><span>revenge</span><span> would be too terrifying if Jeff got involved himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Eric stood frozen, tears streaming down his face as he watched Jeff walk away, a cold glint of hatred flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric thought, "Now I see Jeff's true colors. Queenie</span><span> i</span><span>s his biological daughter</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All this so his mistress' daughter could have a cushy life! My own father abandoned Diana just to bring that woman and her daughter back to the Barnes family, giving them the life they wanted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he ruined us on purpose just to get his hands on Mom's entire inheritance. Queenie fed me all those lies about Diana, making me think she was worthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Every time Diana got hurt, it was because I favored Queenie and ignored it. That night, I hurt Diana so deeply...and she's my real sister."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="489.html">« Prev</a><a href="491.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
