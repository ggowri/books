Rising from her seat, she bowed deeply toward the camera. "Everyone, I'm terribly sorry for letting you witness such a spectacle and for wasting your time. All I want to say here is this to my daughter, I'm sorry. Everything that happened before was my fault. I wronged you. I broke your heart for the sake of an ungrateful wretch. Whether or not you forgive me, Diana, you will always be my most beloved daughter from this day forward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The live chat audience wasn't having it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Late apologies are worthless. Nothing can undo the damage she caused!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[She treated her biological daughter like a foster child. A mother like that doesn't deserve forgiveness!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Her daughter was abandoned for over a decade, and when she finally came back, she was treated like dirt. This poor girl... That kind of "motherly love" is worse than none at all! This mother is a demon. Delayed affection is meaningless! How does she plan to heal the scars she left?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[A mother like her is a devil in disguise. This isn't love; it's a pathetic show! And Queenie? Don't even mention her. Like mother, like daughter. I know Queenie. Her biological mother also seduced Mark. She destroyed a happy family.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[The pain of abandonment cuts deep. Late "motherly love" is a joke. Treating your own daughter like a foster child? That's not love. That's an insult!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Delayed apologies can't erase the past. I'd never accept it!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The audience was furious, their indignation palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Paula remained unfazed. She knew she had been wrong. Her apology wasn't about seeking forgiveness. It was about expressing her remorse to Diana, no matter the outcome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, however, was livid as she watched Paula bow deeply and end the livestream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She grabbed the glass on the table and hurled it straight at Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula tilted her head, dodging it effortlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Coldly, she said, "Queenie, try that again, and I'll have you charged with attempted murder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your reputation is already in the gutter, and today happens to be your movie's premiere. I chose this day on purpose. I want to make sure you understand what it feels like to lose everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I gave you everything you have, and now I'm taking it all back, piece by piece."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula laughed wildly, a manic edge to her voice. She had made up her mind. Everything Queenie had gained because of her, she would strip away. She would leave Queenie with nothing, sending her back to where she belonged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie trembled with rage. Her eyes burned red, wild like a cornered beast. "Paula, you ruined me. I'll kill you for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And next, I'll destroy Diana. If you'd played along a little longer, maybe I'd have spared you both. But no, you just had to push me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice cracked with fury, her hatred boiling over. If looks could kill, Paula would've been shredded to pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Paula wasn't intimidated. "Diana's no pushover. And as for me? I'm not scared of you. Bring it on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie froze a sudden realization dawning on her. She stared at Paula, stunned. "Paula... you planned all this. You've been setting me up from the start."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's laughter was merciless. "Took you long enough to figure it out. Too late now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Queenie. On Christmas Eve, I told your mother the truth. It broke her. She's devastated because everything she cares about is now in ruins, thanks to me. That's how you truly destroy someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I knew you'd call me after that, and I knew you'd come running. People are predictable when consumed by rage. You're so overconfident, you don't even see me as a threat. I ask, and you answer without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You didn't need much coaxing. You spilled every disgusting secret to your fans all on your own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's smile turned icy. "You took my daughter from me. Now, I'll take everything from you. Tell me, Queenie, how am I wrong for doing this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stood there, lifeless, her body cold and her mind spinning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula picked up her streaming equipment and left the room without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the door closed, Queenie collapsed to her knees, pounding her fists against the floor. "No! It wasn't supposed to be like this! Paula, why would you destroy me? I was your favorite daughter! How could you be so cruel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the first time, regret consumed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it hadn't been for Amelie, she wouldn't have reached this point. She'd believed that killing Paula and her children would give her happiness, a family of four living in harmony. She thought she wouldn't become the despised illegitimate daughter anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd imagined herself as the rightful heir of the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that dream was shattered. Her life was in ruins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes stared blankly into the void, devoid of any light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tears had long since dried, leaving behind only a hollow shell of despair and numbness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bright future she once envisioned now lay in pieces at her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her office, Diana sat silently, watching the livestream end. A heavy weight settled on her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna looked at her with concern. Paula might've been Diana's biological mother, but Luna worried this would take an emotional toll on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, there's nothing urgent left today. The shareholders are pleased with the new product line. Why don't I take you home to rest?" Luna suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "No need. I'll stay at the office. Bring me my laptop. I'll check the stock market. Might as well make some money while I can."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna hesitated for a moment before leaving to fetch Diana's laptop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Luna stepped out, Diana slumped in her wheelchair, like a balloon deflated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pressed the power button on her laptop, watching it boot up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had no intention of checking stocks. Instead, she muttered to herself, her voice heavy with sorrow, "Diana, you're just a product of an affair. You don't even know who your father is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more she thought about it, the sadder she became. She was grateful her grandfather had loved her and made her childhood less lonely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she still couldn't understand who had tampered with her paternity test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Jeff had no clue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana picked up her phone and dialed Leopold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few seconds later, he answered. "Grandpa," Diana choked out, tears threatening to spill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold's voice filled with worry. "Sweet pea, what's wrong? Are you crying? Who upset you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, I miss you. When are you coming back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold chuckled warmly. "Ah, so my little darling misses me. I won't be back until April, so I'll miss your birthday. But I've already got a gift prepared for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana fell silent for a moment, disappointment washing over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't expected him to stay away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know what Leopold was up to overseas. He had been unusually secretive lately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, how's Tobias doing?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry about Tobias, Diana. The project is progressing smoothly. Construction will start after the New Year, but it'll take a year or two to complete.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, and don't worry. I invested some money in it. You've got a share in the profits."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a swell of gratitude. Leopold had been investing everywhere, but all the shares were in her name. She was wealthy now, and it gave her an undeniable sense of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled, "Grandpa, hearing you're making money for me cheers me right up. I'll get back to work now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold's voice was full of affection. "You cheeky girl. Are you sure you're okay? If anyone bullies you, just say the word. I'll have Nick teach them a lesson."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="985.html">« Prev</a><a href="987.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
