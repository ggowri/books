Not let her down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you want me to disappoint Diana and marry you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you were supposed to marry me." Queenie gazed at him, aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was determined to marry him. In doing so, she wouldn't end up the loser in this game of hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I was in that car crash, you were the one itching to walk away," Steven's voice was icy, his gaze deep and unreadable, like a dark, still lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promised to marry you, but you'd be the one to give up first. Looks like my words last time didn't sink in, did they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was suddenly startled. It had been a while since she'd seen Steven look so bloodthirsty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had always loved her; she didn't know what had gone wrong. Diana's departure was good for both her and Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven had suddenly decided not to divorce. Was it a common male flaw to cherish things only after losing them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did men only feel the sting of regret once they lost something precious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had worked ten years just to marry the man before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never let Diana win him over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's ambiguous stance made Queenie unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, the Gellar family is in your hands now. Are you still afraid of that useless agreement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't understand why he'd stopped loving her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it just because of discovering her past actions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven had known about her actions all along. He had seen everything yet chose to be endlessly forgiving because he harbored a deep-seated resentment towards Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled enigmatically, "Queenie, if you want me to marry you, donate the Gellar family's assets and live a hard life with me. Are you willing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled awkwardly, "Steven, what do you mean? Would you really donate the Gellar family's assets? Mr. Edward Gellar speaks and acts without clarity in his old age. Are you unclear, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, are you planning to stir up trouble like Mr. Edward Gellar? With your family's legacy spanning a century, would Mr. Edward Gellar really just give it all away? Mr. Edward Gellar has a broad mind, caring for the world, but you can't just give your hard work away for free, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had called Andrew, telling him about the agreement, but he was unaware of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps this was an excuse Steven used to stall her from divorcing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled playfully, leaning back slightly. His tone was indifferent, "You know my grandfather cares for the world. Why couldn't he donate the entire Gellar Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandfather made that will fearing the illegitimate children would taint the Gellar family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My father's illegitimate kids pop up like weeds. But my grandfather only ever had me in his heart, which is why he drew up that will. Naturally, my father's clueless about it. His world revolves around his illegitimate kids, nothing more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into his playful smile, Queenie couldn't understand Steven anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt she could no longer control Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This signal spelled danger. Once the arrow left the bow, there was no reeling it back in. Their schemes were all set in motion, unstoppable now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had crossed paths with all kinds of men, and lately, she even had the leading actor on her current film set wrapped around her finger. His emotions were under her spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his reputation for being both thoughtful and ruthlessly cunning, Steven managed to cloak his true nature from the world. Yet, with her, he revealed only his tender side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However</span><span>, the expression Steven had just shown terrified her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His unveiled ruthlessness made her uneasy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="505.html">« Prev</a><a href="507.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
