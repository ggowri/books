If Emma had known earlier that Diana had the video, she would not have taken the risk. Her career was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana never expected any evidence. However, she suddenly thought of the surveillance camera at the corner. She replayed the video and found it was recorded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She showed the video to Steven. "Mr. Gellar, how do you think we should solve this matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He saw her in the video sitting at a bright marble desk, gravely drawing designs and looking beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind her was a floor-to-ceiling window, and the sunlight shone through onto her, forming a soft halo that accentuated her figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes were intent, and the pen in her hand moved smoothly over the paper, forming amazing pictures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was completely immersed in her own world, undisturbed by the outside world. Her concentration and devotion impressed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her designs gradually took shape with smooth, graceful lines and perfectly matched colors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven whispered in a hoarse voice, "Diana, I didn't know the design drawings were yours. They have already been stolen and released. How about selling them to our company?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure." Diana agreed without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have two conditions. First, I only want the sales dividends of these ten pieces of clothing. Second, I need you to explain how Emma got the design drawings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you cannot meet these two conditions, I now have enough evidence to sue your company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was ruthless. She did not cause trouble to Steven in this matter because she knew that he did not need to plot against her over the design drawings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie clenched her fists and stared at Diana's cold face. She was very furious. What should she do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She failed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After waking up at her birthday party, Diana had really changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glared at Emma sharply and growled, "Emma, I'll give you two choices. Tell me who gave you the design drawings, or go to jail for life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was frightened. She came back to her senses and glanced at Queenie. There was evidence for this matter, and she could not escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how stupid she was, it finally dawned on her that she was being used by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale sent them to me." Emma lowered her head, tears in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though outstanding, she ruined herself for those petty gains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was her work and her achievement. She could do nothing but design in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma walked up to Diana, gazed at her, and said, "Ms. Bishop, I was reckless. Because the design drawings were very impressive, I took advantage of them on an impulse. Please forgive me. I can't do anything but design."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at her coldly. "Emma, I know it's not easy for you to have such an achievement, but you didn't tell the truth. Before coming here, I went to find Gale. You should understand what I mean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's heart suddenly ached. A few interests or an impulse could really destroy one's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry. Ms. Bishop, I'm sorry." She fixed her eyes on Steven, for whom she had betrayed her former company. Was this retribution?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="218.html">« Prev</a><a href="220.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
