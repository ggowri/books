She stared at him warily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exuded a unique temperament, calm and composed, with a hidden sharpness. His eyes were deep and sharp as if he could see through everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under her guarded gaze, a subtle smile appeared on his sexy lips. "Diana, you are my wife. Can't I enter your room?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice carried a hint of teasing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed angrily. She really felt powerless when facing Steven. Had he forgotten the hurt he had just inflicted on her in the private room?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I know you're good at playing with emotions, treating love as a game, and hurting those who truly love you. So, please don't appear in front of me again. Leave right now. If Queenie knew you came to see me alone in my room, she would definitely slander and insult me again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked to her side, his breath surrounding her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana moved back quickly, her eyes showing disgust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I'm going to call Queenie right now and tell her you're here, and let her take you back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana immediately reached for the phone on the bedside table, but Steven stopped her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven grabbed her wrist, his eyes gloomy as he questioned, "Diana, are you trying to push me towards another woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt disgusted upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly became furious. "Let go of me. You make me feel sick!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven recalled the conversation he had with Olivia, in which she mentioned that Diana felt disgusted whenever he was around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His anger was kindling. Did she really despise him that much now?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't push it. I won't marry Queenie. My wife will always be you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana only felt the pain in her wrist. He was gripping it so tightly like iron chains binding her. She frowned, her eyes misting with rage, "You're like a wolf in sheep's clothing, preying on the weak and cunning at heart. Do whatever you want, but don't involve me. You have no limits, never appreciating the kindness others show you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt that saying more would be pointless, so she stopped abruptly. She looked down, dejected, no longer looking at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched as she deflated like a punctured balloon, unable to say another word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get up and come with me. Let's sort this out. Hiding here won't solve anything," he said, his voice a mix of anger and gloom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It still pierced Steven's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let go," she said, her tone unusually cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven released her hand and sat aside, planning to have a proper talk with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, let's talk," he said, lowering his stance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes were filled with a murderous intent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This realization hit Steven like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had never despised Steven as much as she did today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven still asked, "My grandmother said you saved me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't. Helen said that to make you go easy on me. How dare I save you? I can't stand my dirty blood and kidneys in you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes suddenly darkened. "It was not you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, it was not me. Queenie saved you, not me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, he and Queenie were destined to be entwined. Only two people without scruples could create an exciting life together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie would be like a cancer, constantly corroding Steven, and she could rest easy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sneered, staring at Diana. She was so disgusted with him that she was willing to give Queenie credit for the deed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I knew it wasn't you. You're such a liar!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I'm not lying. Did I ever claim I saved you? Steven, we're divorced. Please stay away from me. I really won't stand in the way of you and Queenie. You can get married tomorrow. I'll definitely send you a generous present."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a deep breath, trying to calm down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had to stay calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Getting angry with such a jerk would be a loss for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her heart ached so much it made her whole body tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven indifferently. "Mr. Gellar, you've never believed in me, so don't ask me. Just believe what you see and hear."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her sad expression and the loss in her eyes, feeling heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To distance yourself from me, you don't even want me to know that you spent a hundred million dollars when you saved me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was shocked. How did he find out about that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lowered her head to avoid his gaze. "I didn't, but you're right about one thing. I want to distance myself from you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, wanting to say something more, but his phone rang.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at it and saw it was Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart sank when she heard the name.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was crying, "Steven, save me!!
