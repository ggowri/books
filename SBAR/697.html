The emotions in his deep eyes became even more incomprehensible to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, since Queenie is pregnant with your child, divorce me. For the sake of the child, your grandpa and grandma will accept Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she wanted to do now was to live a good life and work hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Steven laughed out of helpless anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him laughing and asked in confusion, "Steven, what are you laughing about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven lowered his eyes, looked at her coldly with his deep eyes, and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For over 20 years, he had never been with any woman, yet suddenly there was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a grim tone, "I won't sign the divorce agreement!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, hearing his shameless response, said angrily, "Steven, I've never seen such a shameless man like you. Your mistress even has a child now. Why are you still clinging to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew that Queenie had intentionally lied to her for the purpose of ruining their relationship, but he hadn't yet found out who the man behind her was.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Diana was also investigating that man, which would put her in a dangerous situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to worry about why, just stay at home obediently. I will never divorce you unless you die. I will give you a clear explanation about this matter later," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a deep breath, he looked at her and wanted to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana was fed up with his excuses and went upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her back with a dark expression and insisted, "And also, Diana, you don't love me. If you truly loved me, you would have been able to tell right away whether that man was really me or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Diana turned around to look at Steven with some confusion. He was looking at her quietly, his jawline tense. She frowned and asked, "What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven remained as he was, not saying a word, just looking at her quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to be in pain, but when Diana looked at his expression carefully, he was calm again, as if the pain he had just shown had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven ultimately did not answer her. He turned around, walked past her, and went straight upstairs to the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was confused about his obscureness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned. Today's incident was orchestrated by Queenie. It seemed she wouldn't repent unless she put herself in a desperate situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was feeling tired and didn't go to work; instead, she stayed home to work on design drawings.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She planned to go to Tom's lab after Christmas to continue her research on the artificial intelligence medical system.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Steven, there was nothing to do but wait until he got tired of her, and then he would naturally let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she couldn't compete with him, all she could do was wait for the right opportunity. Now that Queenie was pregnant, the day of her divorce from Steven was also drawing near.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana received Tom's message as soon as she returned to her room. Tom: [Diana, Mrs. Foliot is out of danger now. Don't worry.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. Tom always made her feel secure.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana: [Thank you, Tom!]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom replied with a smiley emoji.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and felt cozy being doted on.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and sent a message to Alexander, Cecil, and Joseph, informing them that Lily was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all three replied to her, she then opened her computer to start working.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven's words kept echoing in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said she didn't love him?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly loved Steven very much before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was like a devil. He actually couldn't feel her love at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "He said I can't distinguish him from other men. What does that mean?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="696.html">« Prev</a><a href="698.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
