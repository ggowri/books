Hearing what Paige said, she turned her head to look at the phone in Paige's hand. Seeing the news about Queenie and Zion's contract, she smiled, "Paige, you must believe that bad people will be punished in the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's retribution was yet to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige also felt the same way. "Well, Frank was so mean to me at that time that those terrible things happened to him. Now, his legs may be crippled, and this is his retribution. I have feelings for him, but he doesn't deserve it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige sometimes felt heartbroken when she thought of Frank covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had forgotten that relationship slowly. When she recalled it now, she thought Frank was just a passerby in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Paige's clear eyes, knowing that she actually no longer loved Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, the past is the past. You are more beautiful and better now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige smiled brightly, "Of course. I got rid of a heavy burden. I can walk lightly now. I feel relaxed and clear-headed. I never had this feeling before."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had the same feeling. After letting go of Steven, she discovered that the winter she hated the most was also very beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, Paige, what are you talking about?" Althea came over with the child in her arms and sat next to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the cute baby and explained, "We are living well after getting rid of our past love."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea smiled happily, "The three of us have had similar experiences. Our love was so pure that we only wanted to give our love to that man, but he didn't appreciate it and hurt us badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we don't regret it. When we loved, we gave our whole heart and soul to him. It's him who didn't cherish our love. I don't blame Gale, I just blame myself for falling in love with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt that Althea had always been a kind and good girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige also said, "Diana, I think so too. Let's take the baby out and play."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Althea. "Althea, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea smiled, "No problem. We can go out and play with the baby. Although the weather is cold, we can play inside. The baby is easy to take care of. He eats and sleeps every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige said, "Then let's go to Baison Mall. I want to go to pub. Let's go sing songs and have fun there."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea smiled, "If we want to go to pub, I will go to get a room upstairs and have a nanny to take care of the baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women took action immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea asked the nanny to pack the baby's things. After that, Diana drove them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baison Mall was in the city center and was very crowded on weekends.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was not the weekend, but there were still a lot of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that this was Steven's industry and one of his most profitable projects.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She parked the car in the underground garage and then they took the elevator up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea was carrying things in her hands, Diana was holding the baby, and Paige was carrying their bags. The two nannies were carrying the child's things.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took the elevator together. Coincidentally, Steven came here for an inspection today. As soon as he got out of the car, he saw Diana holding the baby and chatting with Althea who was beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought Diana looked very beautiful while holding the child. He remembered the snowman he saw in the garden when he passed by it this morning. The snowman was also holding a baby in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly realized that he and Diana had been married for two years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Dianas make such a snowman?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she want a child? Steven felt a little excited when he thought of the child.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="761.html">« Prev</a><a href="763.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
