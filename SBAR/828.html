Do you think that you can lecture me just because you won today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just want to remind you to take care of yourself. After all, we still have to fight. If you collapse, I will win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled playfully and beautifully!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie grew jealous as she watched Diana grow more beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said proudly, "Diana, you will never be able to beat me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that Queenie was in a bad mood and came to her to vent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie would be mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Queenie, why should I compare with you? It is enough for me to live better than you. What do you have that is worthy of comparison? You are not richer or prettier than me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you more talented or more educated than me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! There is one thing I am not as good as you. I'm not as good at seducing men as you are, but I don't want to learn that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's even more unnecessary for me to beat you. Why do I have to beat you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have not contributed to the country or served the people. You are a person who only knows how to use despicable means. What on earth should I compete with you for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Queenie coldly. Seeing her face getting paler, Diana felt happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie suddenly felt a sense of frustration. She had always wanted to surpass Diana, but Diana had never regarded her as an opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said directly, "Queenie, I cared about the people of the Marsh family and Steven before, so I didn't fight back. Now I don't care about them anymore, so I will give them all to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you plot against me once, I will pay you back a thousand-fold. There will be more battles between the two of us. I hope you will continue to be as vicious as before. Only if you are cruel enough will you get closer and closer to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's merciless words made Queenie tremble all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Queenie was scared, Diana continued, "Look, the wind and snow outside are gradually getting smaller. When summer comes, those who hibernate will gradually wake up. Andrew's illegitimate children will attack the person Steven cares about the most. And that person is you. In a few months, you will also live a life of exhaustion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had not forgotten this and knew more than Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven himself didn't know how many illegitimate children Andrew had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie originally came to vent her anger to Diana but was very angry at Diana's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you lost Paula's protection. Those people have been ready to make a move for a long time. They only took into account Steven's attitude towards you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana kept on talking. And Queenie stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie trembled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she realize that Diana was the most sober person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew the situation. But Queenie was immersed in revenge and ended up being retaliated against by Diana instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood up suddenly and looked at Diana. "I still have the trump card. As long as Steven protects me, no one dares to hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, smiling. "That's right. Steven's love for you is unmatched. You should cherish him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie would plot against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glared at Diana fiercely and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked and was surprised.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="827.html">« Prev</a><a href="829.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
