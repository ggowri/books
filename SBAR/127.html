I just wanted to force Diana to come back and apologize to you. I feel sorry for you because I see that you are in a bad mood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale looked at Queenie's unfamiliar eyes and always felt that he didn't know Queenie very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie sneered and said, "Isn't it just an apology? Do you think I care about it? The one who is most pitiful when Harry is arrested is his mother. From now on, you should take care of his mother. He went to jail because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie went out with her bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't dare to ask Steven for help with this matter, for fear that if he found out, she would be finished with Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now she still needed Steven's money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for Harry, she would find another way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would not let Diana live well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would let Gale die during the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would deal with them one by one. She didn't want to be an adopted daughter, she didn't want to be an illegitimate daughter, she wanted to be the eldest daughter of a noble family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope had also become an abandoned pawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana returned home and asked Luna to go and rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She accompanied Tobias and Leopold for dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold was very angry when he heard what happened to Diana today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sweet pea, all the kindness you showed to the Marsh family has gone to waste. You are not allowed to come back to the Marsh family anymore." He looked angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Marsh family was bullying Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even animals couldn't do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana stood up and patted him on the back to calm him down. She smiled and said, "Grandpa, calm down. I won't go back again. This is my home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold felt much better after hearing this. "Sit down. We have your favorite abalone tonight. Eat more. Tobias has almost eaten them all. I will give you two."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias was speechless. He also loved abalone. There were six in total, and the three of them had two each. Would he eat the other four?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias gave one of his to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold directly gave all his to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked happy. From now on, she would live a happy life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because Leopold and three brothers would love her all their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had dinner happily, and Olivia also came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia received a big order these days and made some money, so she wanted to take Diana out to play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, let's go. I'll take you out to shop and have fun. How about we go to October Mall?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's eyes flashed slightly for a moment. October Mall was under the name of Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why was it called October Mall?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="126.html">« Prev</a><a href="128.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
