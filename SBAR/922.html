Everything she had worked for turned into nothing but an empty dream, and in the end, everything ended up belonging to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was even more infuriating was that Diana was better than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was Diana so exceptional?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much Queenie racked her brain, she couldn't understand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, who had been retrieved from the countryside like a wild child, had somehow managed to study abroad all these years. Where had it gone wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly turned to George, and her gaze cold. "Diana has already divorced Steven, yet she still managed to take everything from him. George, how can I accept this? How can I stay calm? How can I compose myself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've waited for this moment for over a decade, and in the end, it was all for Diana, the woman I hate the most. George, my heart hurts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't accept it. All these years of scheming, all for Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Diana's calm, unhurried expression made her collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie buried herself in George's arms, crying her heart out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had slipped quietly through her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in too much pain. Over a decade of planning had consumed her endless effort and energy, not to mention the constant need to console the anguished Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had designed countless schemes to capture Steven's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All her hopes and dreams had been carefully planned and executed with all her might. Yet, at this moment, everything had crumbled into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George gently patted her back, smiling as he comforted her, "Why are you crying? You still have me. Even without everything Steven had, my company can still give you a happy life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his comforting words, Queenie felt better and stopped crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't enough for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not nearly enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her dream was to become a businesswoman admired by everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her current achievements were far from sufficient to shock everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to leave a legacy for generations to admire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But George? He didn't have Steven's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought she loved George. Yet, seeing his cowardly demeanor today, she finally understood. If Steven had been the one here, the outcome would have been different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven would have had control of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But George, this useless man, could accomplish nothing without her and Andrew preparing for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't understand why they looked the same, but George was so stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In anger, Queenie pushed him away and asked, "George, I've been wondering, did Steven already know about your existence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly thought of the photos she sent to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had shown them to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was taken aback, thinking, "Could this be the reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George frowned and asked, "Queenie, why would he know? Do you know something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wiped her tears and said, "I sent the photos of us to Diana to provoke her and make her leave Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She must have shown the photos to Steven. Could he have discovered your existence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George slapped her hard without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was dark. "Queenie, how many times have I warned you? Steven is cunning and suspicious. He grew up in an environment without love and guards against everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So my dad let you get close to him on purpose when you were a teenager so you could develop a bond of friendship and lower his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what did you do? Someone as smart as you, who can run so many companies, how could you be so foolish? So careless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George was trembling with rage, his face turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was struck across the face and glared at him with hatred. She had endured so much hardship over the years for this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he failed, he hit her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was furious. "George, are you taking advantage of my love for you to repeatedly cross my boundaries?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you many times. You can scold me, you can be angry, but you can never hit me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how Steven treated me? His kindness to me isn't something you can compare to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He gave me all his love, but what have you done for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our companies were all thanks to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this all I got in return? A slap?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her questions were piercing and painful. She despised men who hit women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, only useless men hit women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt she had wasted her life being entangled with him for so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had she known this would be the result, she would have married Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, she would have had endless wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Steven's help, she could effortlessly become a successful businesswoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George was enraged. Every word made him angrier, but knowing she was still useful and realizing he had been too impulsive, he suppressed his temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his heart, he cared for Queenie. Over the years, her warmth was what had kept him going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her into his arms, gently patting her back with his large hand, and comforted her, "Queenie, don't be upset. I was too angry earlier. If it's because of those photos that we failed, then our efforts of over a decade have been for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I not be angry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are angry now because you failed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hesitated. She thought, "Could that really be the reason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it is, then my failure is my own doing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in deep agony. She had always thought Diana was weak and incompetent, which made her arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had never responded to her provocations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back, Diana was the most resilient one. Meanwhile, Queenie had grown complacent over small successes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With tears in her eyes, she asked George, "But Steven is dead. Who is helping Diana? Who exposed the Foliot family's thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana admitted it," George replied angrily. Even he didn't know where things had gone wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie lowered her head in defeat. She couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought about Diana's smart medical system, which Diana claimed she had started developing two years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Could she really be that capable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been too arrogant, always looking down on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had once said, "Never underestimate any opponent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the Gale incident, Diana had spoken those words, and Queenie hadn't understood. Now she did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Diana had only been focused on treating Steven's eyes, so she hadn't reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's patience made her label Diana as useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, Diana's stunning performance had left her completely in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's mind went blank as she asked George, "George, what do we do now?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="921.html">« Prev</a><a href="923.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
