This isn't just affecting our company, it's dragging Jace into it too."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had really played her cards right.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had exposed entirely Queenie's true colors.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana must've been ticked off by the recent trending topics to strike back like this.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said, "Queenie made her bed, now she has to lie in it. Tell Jace we're pulling our hundred million dollars investment."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was trying to smoke the guy out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the only way to make that man surface within the year.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan smiled, "Mr. Gellar, you've finally made a smart call. I'll notify them about the divestment right away."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven held his head in his hands, feeling miserable. His mind kept replaying Diana's resolute words - she wouldn't take it lying down anymore. She'd fight back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her counterattack was as fierce as it was swift, showing a side of her he barely recognized.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff caught the livestream and frantically tried to get Queenie on the phone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie finished snapping photos of the design sketches before answering her phone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, what are you doing in Diana's office?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, what else? That woman's been living it up since she left the Marsh family. I won't let her..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut it, Queenie. Diana's office has a livestream running. Everything you just did was seen by viewers online. Get out of there now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie bit her tongue.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced around but couldn't spot any streaming equipment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She scrambled to leave in a panic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the door, she ran into Luna.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She raised her hand to slap Luna.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna took the hit without flinching, her face a mask of icy amusement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt a chill run down her spine at Luna's cold stare.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna stepped forward, her eyes flashing with fury. "Queenie, I've been itching to get even for Diana. She's too kind-hearted and always held me back. But now you've walked right into this. You've already messed with my hand, so you might as well kiss it goodbye."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stumbled back, eyeing Luna warily.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch it, you little brat. Steven's right across the street..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish, Luna's foot connected hard.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's slight frame went flying like a leaf in the wind, crashing to the ground with a sickening thud.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ouch!" Queenie felt like her insides had been scrambled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It hurts so bad," she whimpered, face-down and quietly sobbing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna loomed over her, a cold smirk on her face. "Oh, does that hurt? When you framed Diana, when you plotted against her... that pain was a thousand times worse. And you can't even handle this?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we're just getting started. Diana knew you were up to no good. She had me set up a little livestream for you. You like scheming so much? Let's see how you like being on the receiving end. Time for you to know what it feels like when the whole internet turns on you."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="318.html">« Prev</a><a href="320.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
