"Diana, I'm kneeling to thank you&mdash;for saving my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana offered him a faint smile. By saving him, she had saved herself too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel, if you're serious about turning over a new leaf, stay away from Queenie," she said calmly. "Work with your parents to build your family business. Learn to collaborate with Cecil&mdash;lean on each other and grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Life's too short, and you've got all the money you could need. Why not just enjoy it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie has powerful allies, and while she hasn't been openly ruthless, she's burned a lot of bridges. If you want dirt on her, follow her closely. You'll find enough skeletons in her closet to take her down without destroying your own future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are plenty of people who've suffered under her. Dig into her past&mdash;workplace bullying, abuses of power&mdash;they're all there, waiting to be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worst of all, she's even locked some of her victims away in psychiatric hospitals. With enough evidence, you could destroy her without ever lifting a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why get your hands dirty and ruin your future?" Diana's tone was sharp but practical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like Samuel&mdash;a privileged playboy with time and resources to spare&mdash;had no need to act recklessly. He could easily use his wealth and connections to dig into Queenie's secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their world, even tax regulations could be bent into unwritten rules of the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel knew how to navigate that terrain. With a little effort and strategy, he could unearth plenty of dirt on Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when the time came, he could catch her completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Samuel standing in her way, no matter how far Queenie tried to extend her reach, she'd find herself forced back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But remember, Samuel," Diana added. "Because you didn't kill me tonight, Queenie won't let you off the hook. You'll have to stay ahead of her if you want to bring her down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel blinked, taken aback by her warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Queenie really be so cruel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's soft smile didn't falter. "What's wrong? Don't believe me? Go see Jace Foliot. </span><span>He'll tell you everything you need to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel hesitated. "You're really not going to call the police on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Why would I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small act of mercy often left the biggest impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel stared at her, disbelief etched on his face. "I literally just tried to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shrugged lightly, her expression unreadable. "I'm not turning you in. Sure, I'm not a fan of your parents or spoiled kids like you, but life's full of fleeting encounters. You're just a passing face in my story. You came, and now you'll leave. That's all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Samuel, we're young. There's no need to live like this. If you really want answers, talk to Jace Foliot. You might be surprised by what you find."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel bowed his head deeply. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rising slowly, he fixed his gaze on Diana. "Diana, you're a good person. From now on, no matter what happens, you can count on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was right&mdash;they were still young, living lives others could only dream of, surrounded by wealth and privilege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spending the rest of that life rotting away in prison? That would be nothing short of a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze softened as she looked him over. The light from the room illuminated his sharp features, making them even more striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel," she said, almost as an afterthought. "You've got a good-looking face. Don't turn yourself into someone everyone hates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm letting you go today, not because you're young, but because life is hard for everyone. You're not the only one struggling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel blinked, surprised by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had ever said something like that to him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he had money, but happiness? That was another story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father was unfaithful, his mother lost in her own world. Samuel had grown up in a fractured home. Out of guilt, his parents had showered him with money, hoping it would fill the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But was he happy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, not at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to find his own sense of purpose or joy, Samuel had drifted into the role of a spoiled rich kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found fleeting satisfaction in dominating others, using his privilege to mask his emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, for the first time, someone had told him a truth he'd never considered&mdash;life is hard for everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked suddenly, "Diana, why would you say something like that? Look at this mansion, at everything you own. Your life is a dream compared to most people's. How can you claim it's hard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a small laugh, shaking her head. "Samuel, do you think money makes life any easier? People like you and Queenie are constantly after my life. Does that sound simple to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me this&mdash;if I dropped you in a place with no connections, no resources, would </span><span>you be afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Running a business is about more than money. It's about relationships, balance. Could you manage that without your family's safety net?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Samuel faltered, unable to find the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't," Diana said bluntly. "Without the Farley name, without your parents' resources, you'd be left with nothing but a dwindling bank account."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was the kind of person who lived with a constant undercurrent of insecurity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't stand idle&mdash;every free moment was spent researching new ways to make money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, no matter what the future held, financial security was the only safety net she could truly rely on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she had a way out, she believed she could start over anywhere and carve out a fresh path for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed dryly, his tone tinged with self-deprecation. "Even if I only had my savings, I think I'd survive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, shifting gears, "By the way, Diana. Where do you think Queenie will strike next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked at the sudden change in tone. Samuel was quick to adapt, much like Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think about Cecil. He wanted what his brother had&mdash;a chance to be on Diana's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Cecil had become friends with Diana, his career had taken off, reaching heights Samuel couldn't ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel envied his brother for dodging Queenie Marsh's schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had narrowly escaped Queenie's trap himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, people could be so blind they didn't realize they were being sold out until it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what Queenie's next move was, Samuel was determined to strike her down where it hurt most&mdash;her business empire. This time, Samuel vowed to take his revenge head-on, without stooping to dirty tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, on the other hand, mulled things over. The course of events had shifted drastically from her past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her instincts were right, Queenie's next move would involve sabotaging the two projects Diana had presented earlier that day in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's methods were always varied, always underhanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the moment, her focus would likely shift toward the entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew how to leverage her infamy&mdash;equal parts scandal and notoriety&mdash;to turn it into profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had to guess, she'll target the entertainment industry. She recently signed a deal with Zion Swift. That's not a path she'll abandon easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With her resources and connections, she might climb higher than anyone expects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's fists clenched at her words, the muscles in his arms tightening. The determination in his eyes was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's why she went after Jace Foliot's company&mdash;it's a giant in entertainment. </span><span>She's trying to build a shortcut to the top."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But nothing would be that easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone turned colder, more resolute. "But she won't get away with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning toward the door, he glanced back at Diana. "Wait for my news, Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Samuel strode out, his steps purposeful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched his retreating figure and called after him, her voice tinged with irony. "Samuel, take your weapon with you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="933.html">« Prev</a><a href="935.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
