He quickly tried to clarify. "Mr. Hastings, I think there's been a misunderstanding. I never reported your uncle. We've had a good relationship with him. He's the one who's introduced many of our top graduates. Why would we turn on him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, he did get drunk last night and try to take advantage of one of the students, but she managed to escape. Could she be the one who reported him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario couldn't think of anyone else who could have reported Brandon except for Kara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson's voice came through, dripping with sarcasm. "Mario, do you really think this makes any sense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario's frustration grew. He had no idea who'd reported Brandon, but he didn't like being blamed without proof. "Mr. Hastings, I'm not joking about something like this. Ms. Marsh was attacked today, and we're still at the hospital. She's still concerned about Mr. Brandon Hastings' students. How could we report him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson didn't respond and just hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie heard about Brandon, her face went pale. Everything was falling apart today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario lowered his voice. "Ms. Marsh, Brandon was reported. He's been trying to take advantage of his students for a while, but I didn't expect someone to report it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson said it was us who reported him and then just hung up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario felt it had to be Kara because her attitude last night had been way too extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless!" Queenie </span><span>snapped,</span><span> her voice sharp. "I told you to get Kara to sign the contract. How could you mess up something so simple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario hung his head, acknowledging his mistake, but his mind was still on who could have reported Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shot him a look. "Didn't you go to Kara's school?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario shook his head. "No. I called one of her friends, and apparently, she didn't even go back to her dorm last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought for a moment. It was Christmas, so maybe Kara had gone home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. Mario, go take care of the hospital paperwork."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario noticed her mood had improved, so he went downstairs to handle the necessary paperwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she left, Queenie looked at George, lying in bed. His face was so bruised that she could barely recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart clenched. Mario had bought her an electric wheelchair, so she powered it up and wheeled herself over to George. She took his hand gently, speaking softly. "George, don't worry. I'll make sure we get our revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held his hand tightly, her voice trembling. "You have to wake up soon. Seeing you like this breaks my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered to herself, unable to shake the fury building inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she remembered those two men insulting George, calling him worthless, she wanted to make them pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind turned to Diana, the hatred in her eyes burning. If her Christmas had been ruined, she wasn't about to let anyone else have a peaceful one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered last year Paula would personally design custom dresses for her, take her to exclusive events, and introduce her to powerful people in business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brothers would spoil her, buy her gifts and take care of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this year, everything had changed. She had nothing, no beautiful dresses, no mother's love, no lavish parties, no family warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her leg broken on this Christmas day felt like a final blow. At that moment, it felt like she'd fallen from the highest point to the lowest. The weight of the difference was almost too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp look in her eyes, she pulled out her phone and dialed Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Diana was enjoying a lovely meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan and Nick had really outdone themselves with the cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at them with a smile, praising their skills. "Nolan, you three are getting better and better at cooking. This fish and salad are amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget about the turkey. Everyone needs to have some."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan smiled </span><span>faintly,</span><span> his expression relaxed. "Got it. We'll make sure to eat plenty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick chimed in with a grin, "Ms. Bishop, the pancakes are really sweet and delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry laughed softly, "Nick, your words are even sweeter than the pancakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna looked around at the group with a contented smile. "It feels so much </span><span>more lively</span><span> with all of you here for Christmas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana agreed, feeling the warmth of the atmosphere. She was about to suggest they play a game when her phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked it up, seeing it was a call from Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of irritation washed over her. "What could this woman possibly want right now?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She answered the call, and instantly, Queenie's voice erupted through the phone, filled with fury. "Diana, is it you? Did you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback but had a feeling that something had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie only ever sounded like this when she was absolutely furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what are you talking about?" Diana took a sip of her drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't even let her finish before shouting again. "Diana, if you ruined my Christmas, I'm not going to let you get away with it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tobias is your eldest brother, right? I'll make sure he can never come back to the country. This is the price you'll pay for messing with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled. She almost couldn't believe what she was hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, yeah, my brother's name is Tobias. But are you really so sure your little hands can reach that far?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you credit for having a few tricks up your sleeve, but do you even know who Tobias is? Have you looked into his connections? Try making a move and let's see if your company can survive it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew how to turn the tables when it came to threats, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie fell silent for a second, realizing that Diana was right. She knew Tobias had wealth and influence abroad, and even more so in the domestic business world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was making a valid point. Trying to target him without fully understanding his power was nothing but a foolish move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're unbelievable! How did you survive that car accident? Why didn't you just die?" Queenie's words were sharp and full of venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath, silently telling herself not to get worked up. But a part of her was curious about what had pushed Queenie to this level of rage and viciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused for a moment and wondered if this was a form of retaliation from Paula against Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Dylan wasn't back yet and Gale was still recovering, Paula wouldn't have made a move just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A calm smile spread across Diana's face as she asked, "So, Queenie, are you admitting you had someone run me over?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="959.html">« Prev</a><a href="961.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
