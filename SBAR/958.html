"Don't worry. Even if they can't have a good Christmas this year, next year when they come back, they'll have a great one. By then, Evan will have you, and he'll be even happier than before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna blushed, clearly anxious about Evan getting hurt and not having anyone to take care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, she couldn't even reach him on the phone, and there was no news at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, do you think they were seriously hurt that night? We haven't heard anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't entirely sure, but she was confident it couldn't be too bad. "Luna, when I woke up, it had already been three days. But don't worry. Dalton had everything under control at the company. They should be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Diana was feeling uneasy, knowing that Dalton had taken care of everything and had been respectful to her made her feel better. It meant Steven must be okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton was fiercely loyal to Steven because Steven had saved his life and even helped pay for his education abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently patted Luna's hand. "They'll be fine. Seriously, no need to worry. Even if they're hurt, it's not life-threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan is smart. If he sensed danger, he'd get out of there fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana remembered when they went diving, and when Queenie showed up, Evan immediately realized the danger and made sure they both got away safely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was still upset, looking miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana saw how worried she was and tried to comfort her. "Luna, stop stressing. It'll be okay. Trust me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded, but she still didn't seem convinced. "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her still down, Diana smiled and tried to cheer her up. "Hey, come on, don't be sad. No more moping. Go to decorate the Christmas tree! We're going to have a happy Christmas, and the new year will be smooth sailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No more long faces. If something had happened to Evan, we would've heard by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Luna stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll go do it. But you need to change the bandages on your leg. I'll go grab the first aid kit for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched as Luna limped away. It was hard to watch her struggle like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you go ahead. I can change it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna came back with the first aid kit and set it on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana opened it and was surprised to see the anti-inflammatory and hemostatic medicines were both gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd been full last time she checked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out her phone and checked the security footage. She went back to the footage from three days ago and quickly saw Evan. He had taken nothing but the anti-inflammatory and hemostatic medicines before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, feeling a sense of relief. It looked like they were fine after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind drifted to Steven. She wondered if he had ever regretted what happened that night with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out some iodine to treat her wound. Her knee had a large gash, and it hurt like hell when she touched it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She winced, eyes welling up as she looked at the open wound. The pain was so intense that it reminded her of the time she'd suffered an even worse pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never wanted to go through that again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carefully, she treated the wound, but as she looked up again, tears were falling freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hurts so much... Steven, you jerk!" She cried through her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven, watching the footage, felt his heart break as he saw her in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people that night had actually been sent by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and Evan were celebrating Christmas at another location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven heard the door open, he turned around to see Evan entering, arms full of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was just them and a few bodyguards, they were still going to make the holiday special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Evan and asked, "Where's Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan </span><span>blinked,</span><span> a bit wary. "Sir, are you planning to give Ms. Marsh a Christmas gift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything that happened with Queenie, he couldn't believe Steven was still thinking about getting her a gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was clearly frustrated. "What are you giving her? A luxury car? A mansion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't stop thinking about her, maybe you should just stay away from Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least Diana was smart. She knew you'd sacrifice anything for Queenie, so she divorced you. Honestly, it was probably the best decision she could have made."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven just stared at Evan, who was clearly angry. He didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough with the ranting," Steven said, his voice cold. "Tell the bodyguards to find Queenie. Break one of her legs and let her know she messed with the wrong person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's expression shifted, looking a bit awkward. "Ah... so I misunderstood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face hardened. "What else did you think it was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan scratched his head sheepishly. "Sir, I just didn't want you to fall for her again. I know how you used to be, completely entranced by her. You'd believe anything she said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at him nonchalantly, leaning back in his chair with a relaxed, almost carefree air. His demeanor radiated a laid-back confidence, effortlessly cool and a bit enigmatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make the call," he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was feeling better physically, though he still couldn't stand or walk. He'd gotten used to it after the accident years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan eagerly went to make the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven's attention shifted back to the monitor showing Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sitting on the couch, changing her bandages, tears streaming down her face. She looked so cute despite being a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a twinge of heartache but also helplessness. He wanted to comfort her, but he couldn't show up right now, not with George still involved in his own plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Queenie's place, she was spending Christmas with George. They had decorated the tree together in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had cooked a meal for him, and as she was preparing dinner, there was a knock at the door. She thought it was her takeout delivery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the door, only to be met with two men standing there. Her expression faltered, and she eyed them suspiciously. "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men smiled faintly, and before she could react, he swung a baton at her leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Queenie didn't have time to dodge. The baton struck her leg with a sharp crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man grumbled, "I don't usually hit women, but you're just too cruel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain shot through her body, and her face twisted in anger. She glared at the man, eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you messed with the wrong people, Queenie. Enjoy the rest of your life, crippled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man dropped the baton and muttered under his breath, "I'm stuck dealing with this wicked woman on Christmas. What a bummer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what happened?" George came out of the room, alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men froze for a moment, then exchanged a glance and grinned maliciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them quickly pulled off his jacket and used it to cover George's head.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="957.html">« Prev</a><a href="959.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
