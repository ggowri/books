Why are you against it? I'm warning you, if you think you can treat me as a disposable tool, that's not going to work. I'm not like that fool Diana. The money must be transferred to my account on time every month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your brother's request. I am carrying the Marsh family's child," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said with a cold smile, "Penelope, you can't threaten me anymore. Gale is already crippled, which is exactly what I hoped for. Since he no longer has the ability to manage the company, you have indeed lost your usefulness now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So,</span><span> I </span><span>won</span><span>'t </span><span>care about</span><span> you or your child anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I believe you know better than I do whether the child you're carrying is really Gale's. I have videos, evidence that can prove the child in your belly isn't my elder brother's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As soon as I tell my mother about this, your days won't be pleasant anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, I won't give you any more money. I have evidence of your forgery and also evidence that you committed murder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What evidence of murder?" Penelope seemed panicked, thinking, "What does Queenie know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Penelope, you really are a fool. Did you think I would seek cooperation with you for no reason? It's because I have evidence of your murder and knew that you could be exploited by me, so I deliberately let you get close to Gale." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone as rotten as you is quite fitting for my elder brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a video proving that you drove that girl to her death. The parents of the girl who was bullied by you </span><span>still keep</span><span> searching for evidence. What do you think would happen to you if I were to hand over this evidence?" she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope, upon hearing these words, suddenly remembered what Diana had said, "Penelope, you were just being used by Queenie. After she's done with you, she'll discard you, or perhaps there will be an even worse fate awaiting you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart suddenly skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, it turns out you've been using me all along," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. You've slept with many men, and I used you to seduce Gale, just to humiliate him. Diana had warned you, but you didn't take it seriously. Now, you're even more presumptuous, asking me for money to support another man's child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Penelope, you are such a whore," Queenie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope's voice was trembling. "So, Queenie, you don't plan to give me money anymore, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, my little indiscretions are nothing. You know how much the Marsh family dotes on me. If I say that the child in your belly isn't Gale's, no one will believe you. Besides, I have evidence of your murder. If you dare to expose my affairs, I can make sure you spend the rest of your life in prison." Queenie hung up the phone after she finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not at all afraid of Penelope; the reason she had sought her out for collaboration in the first place was because she knew her secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People with secrets were easier to manipulate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope stared at the phone that Queenie had hung up. Without the 50,000 dollars per month, she didn't know how she would survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered, "How did Queenie find out that I drove that woman to her death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you bastard!" Penelope was so angry that her belly hurt slightly. She didn't dare to be angry anymore. Gale had never called her since he went abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really didn't care about her at all. In fact, she was already very panicked, fearing that Gale would know the truth and ignore her on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She raised her eyes and glanced at the third floor, wondering whose child was in Althea's womb.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="546.html">« Prev</a><a href="548.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
