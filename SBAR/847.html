She was anxious to find Paige. With Queenie here, everyone around her would be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way. We have nothing to talk about. You've schemed against me time and time again. From now on, I will no longer trust you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's brows furrowed, and he stared at Diana deeply. Seeing her in pain, he felt sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her discomfort and her grievance had been brought upon her by him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven understood that she was furious. Coincidentally, the designs he obtained were exactly the ones worn by Queenie's models.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he really didn't know when the design drawings were leaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was very satisfied with the drawings and was aware that they would be a hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always trusted Diana's design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, this time, I definitely didn't help her," Steven explained, observing her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, she didn't believe him at all. She mocked, her eyes so icy that his heart skipped a beat, "Steven, I find that you are really a scumbag. Is it so difficult to admit that you helped Queenie and that you love her deeply?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you plotted against me like this, I used to feel heartbroken for many days, but now I am not sad at all. Instead, I am very calm. Having been extremely disappointed in you for a long time, I don't expect anything from you, so please get out of my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Diana was still very sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She appeared calm on the surface, but the pain spread throughout her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It still broke her heart that Queenie was the person Steven cared about the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned with complicated emotions, knowing that Diana wouldn't listen to or believe his explanation right now. He fell silent. Helpless, he was determined to find out the truth and prove his innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was so </span><span>worried</span><span> to find Paige that she stopped arguing with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went out and bumped into Paige's assistant, Joanna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Joanna, where is Paige?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna shook her head and replied, "Ms. Bishop, I'm looking for her, too, but I can't get through to her on her phone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was now completely anxious. Although the venue was noisy and no cell phone ringing could be heard, many things had to be communicated through cell phones. It was impossible that Paige wouldn't check her cell phone for a long time. Moreover, after the competition was over and she left, Paige would not stay at the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had a premonition. "Joanna, let's split up and look for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna said, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood motionless, not knowing where to find Paige. In such a big venue, where did she go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she went to answer a call, it was time for her to come back now. Also, her phone could always be reached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was very worried about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven strode over and advised in a low voice, "Diana, let's go to check the backstage surveillance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Diana said, "Okay! I'll go to check it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was about to leave, Queenie appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gazed at Diana with a smile and blocked her way, preventing her from locating Paige so early. "Diana, I've told you that I will definitely trample on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "Queenie, you stole my design drawings and won first place. Do you feel a sense of accomplishment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I care about is the result. I won, so you claimed that I stole your drawings. Diana, aren't you a typical sore loser?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at her calmly in silence. Sometimes, when people were in a rage, their faces were expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that her previous decision was wrong, which allowed Queenie to act so arrogantly in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, this is the first time I've seen such a confident thief."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, is it so difficult to acknowledge other people's excellence?" Yanson walked over haughtily with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at him and frowned slightly.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="846.html">« Prev</a><a href="848.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
