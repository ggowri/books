You can just call me Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara was momentarily surprised, recognizing her as the woman who had been all over the news recently for taking over the Gellar Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her beauty and evident capability, Kara couldn't help but feel a surge of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're Ms. Bishop. Thank you for saving me. I'm Kara Black, a senior in the Design Department at Silverwood University. You can call me Kara."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd be graduating next semester, and she was looking forward to it. Once she graduated, she could start earning money and finally live life on her own terms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Kara, it's a pleasure to meet you. Let me have someone take you back </span><span>to school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Luna quickly interjected, "Diana, she can't go back to school. It'll only be more dangerous for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Kara tensed, confused by Luna's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned, "Why is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just now, Kara told me her teacher arranged for her to come here tonight to sign that contract. If she goes back to school, her teacher won't let her off the hook. Tomorrow, he'll send her right back to those partners, and she won't be able to escape being forced into that unfair contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A teacher like that doesn't deserve to be one. This situation needs to be handled properly so Kara can return to school safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback. Now, it made sense why Kara had chosen Queenie all those years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara had a gambling-addicted father and an indifferent mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had fought tooth and nail to get where she was, and now, her teacher was taking advantage of her, forcing her to serve Queenie through a contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew she couldn't stand by and do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been overly focused on taking care of Steven in her past life, ignoring a lot of other things. But this time, things were different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Kara. "Kara, what's your teacher's name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brandon Hastings," Kara replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's expression turned icy. "That's interesting. He's actually Yanson's uncle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's brows furrowed. "I just ran into Yanson outside. We had a bit of a disagreement. I didn't realize his uncle was causing trouble, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it made sense why the two men had brought up Mario earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pressed on. "The man who wanted you to sign the contract, his name was Mario, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara nodded quickly. "Yes! That's him! Even my teacher treats him like he's untouchable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Luna. "Find everything you can about Brandon, his background, anything that could be used against him. If there's something shady, we'll turn it over to the police tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded. "I'll investigate right away, but Kara can't go back to school just yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana now realized she'd overheard the conversation in the elevator earlier. One of the men had to be Brandon. She'd missed that detail earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Kara. "Kara, I'll arrange a place for you to stay for now. Once we've dealt with Brandon, you can head back to school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara's eyes brightened with gratitude, tears welling up. She felt like she had finally met a truly good person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Bishop! I'm a jewelry designer. If you ever need any designs, I'll do them for free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled but shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to do them for free. You have real talent, and your designs will only become more valuable over time. But first, you need to graduate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When our company hires, we need to see your degree, plus the award-winning designs you've worked on. Bring them along when the time comes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana offered her a chance, a real one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara wasn't facing her hardest time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her toughest challenge was after graduation when her father's gambling debts reached one million dollars. He tricked her into coming home and tried to force her into marriage to pay off his debts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara forced a smile. "Thank you, Ms. Bishop, for giving me this opportunity. With this, graduation will be much easier for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll work hard and always keep a grateful heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew what she was capable of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. You can apply for an internship at our company. You don't have many classes left, do you?" Diana liked to see things through when she helped people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara's voice shook with emotion. "Yes, not many. Thank you so much! I really appreciate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Nick, who was standing outside. "Nick, come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick walked in, nodding to Diana. "Ms. Bishop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gestured toward Kara. "Arrange a place for Kara to stay. Also, get her some basic supplies so she can enjoy her Christmas in peace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick noticed the tear-streaked look in Kara's eyes and his expression softened. "Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Kara. "Ms. Black, please follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kara bowed deeply to Diana in thanks before leaving with Nick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna pushed Diana out quietly, and they slipped away without disturbing anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the other side, Owen had just finished signing the contract with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen looked at the signed document, and as soon as he saw Queenie's name, a smile spread across his face. "Queenie, Steven really spoils you, huh? He handed this contract to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled softly. With George using Steven's name, he couldn't afford to betray his connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only she could sign this contract. Once she took over Owen's company, no one would bat an eye, and Owen would just have to take the loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled lightly, her voice bright. "Owen, you know how much Steven cares about me. We share everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, however, understood that Diana had been right all along. Queenie wasn't just after his company. She was aiming for Yanson next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if on cue, the door burst open, and Yanson stormed in, fuming with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie! Owen! Diana is out of control! I tried to teach her a lesson earlier, but the man she brought along beat me up! My face is swollen, and there's a chunk of flesh torn from my gums. I haven't been able to eat for days. It's so painful!" He winced in agony, his teeth gritted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen frowned, "How exactly did you try to teach her a lesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson smirked. "I pushed her wheelchair, planning to knock her over and have a </span><span>laugh. That damn cripple. She deserves it. But you know what else? I ran into Ethan. This guy's been doing business for the past couple of years, and now he's expanded all the way to </span><span>Capitole</span><span>. I'm honestly shocked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen stared at Yanson, bewildered. They were so set on making Diana the villain, while Queenie's sweet demeanor had completely blinded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen sighed, "Did Diana get hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie narrowed her eyes, sensing something was off. She studied Owen closely, her expression shifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson, still seething, leaned toward Owen and spoke in a low voice. "No, I didn't really hurt her. She just bumped into a wall. She's fine now. The worst part is that she threatened to call the cops on me! If Ethan hadn't shown up and stopped her, I would've been hauled off by the police by now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="955.html">« Prev</a><a href="957.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
