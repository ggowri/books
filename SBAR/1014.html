Ever since Diana started fighting back, things had been cropping up one after another, and nothing good had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened every day made her angry and frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked irritably, "What happened to him? I have already broken off relations with him. He doesn't care about me. He only wants his company and money. Why are you calling me when something's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever she thought about the things he did at Christmas, she hated them deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put everything on them. How could they lose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie shouted, "Queenie, your father's company has gone bankrupt. Lily and Paula planned all of this. Paula's company didn't become insolvent, instead, she possesses assets amounting to billions of dollars. Noah's overseas company was also a victim of her schemes. She tricked us all. Queenie, your father had a stroke. The doctor said that from now on he can only lie in bed. We have nothing now. Queenie, your father treated you well, and we still love you. You can't sit back and do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, Paula is really wicked. She said that we should go back to where we came from. Queenie, she kept her word. Now, we've been stripped of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Woohoo..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her cry, Queenie burst into tears too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, what the hell did she do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did she end up penniless and possess nothing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she was good at scheming. Every one of her schemes to frame Diana succeeded. Was it the confidence Diana gave her that made her calculate and go against Paula with such assurance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she really thought of every possibility. When did Diana gradually rise and make her fall into their trap?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice weary and choked with sobs, she felt distressed and said, "Amelie, why did you let me lose? I've staked everything on you, betting that I would have a happy and perfect family. How can you lose? How?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie screamed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold wind outside the window ruffled her hair, and the tears streamed ceaselessly down on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted, "Why is your love based solely on money? Without money, there is no love. Why are you like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are my biological mother. How could you do this to me? I schemed against Paula, who had raised me for 20 years, just so that you could become Mrs. Marsh open and aboveboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how could you let me lose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she had nothing, as long as she had a family, she would not be so sad and desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She planned everything for the sake of Amelie at the very beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was stricken with unbearable pain when she heard her words. She cried, "Queenie, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please, don't leave me. I know now that you are the only one who treats me the best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For you, I was with Mark before. But I didn't expect Paula and Lily to plot against him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was heartbroken and in so much pain. Why was she so stupid? She could never compete with Paula with her capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't been exposed, she would still be as cool as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really regretted it. It was so tragic to be old and have no one to depend on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen many elderly people in the village live a solitary life throughout their lives. She struggled to get out and finally lived the life she wanted. But...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt helpless. She said ruthlessly, "I will not help you this time. I already gave you 30 million dollars at Christmas. I have done enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Jeff, you saw the scene that night with your own eyes. Being heartless and unrighteous, he doesn't deserve to be a father, and you, you are worse than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was that desperate for you back then, and now I only hate you that much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You made me lose miserably. You made me lose everything. Now, I can't even protect myself. Don't call me anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still have a son, and Jeff has four sons. I won't help you. Go find them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she hung up the phone. It dropped to the ground, emitting a dull sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood by the window, closed her eyes, and felt great pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she couldn't hold back her tears. She slowly crouched down, hugging herself tightly. It hurt so much, her whole body was in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lost, totally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lost everything she cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Diana was at the height of her elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her head in pain and screamed, "Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia heard that Queenie would no longer take care of them, she slumped to the ground in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blankly looked out the window. Even Queenie had abandoned her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears streamed down her face in a fierce torrent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cell phone suddenly rang. "Buzz buzz buzz..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spun around abruptly and grabbed the phone. Seeing that it was from her son, she didn't feel like answering for some unknown reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hung up the phone. But Noah called again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, wiped away her tears, and answered, "Hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, help me. I was set up in the casino. They want me to pay 50 million dollars. Mom, please bring the money to bail me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his heart-wrenching voice, she felt as if the sky was about to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this karma?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to scheme against everything Paula had and even plot against the lives of her five children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it all came back to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her daughter didn't care about her anymore, and her son was a gambler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, but then cried, "Noah, I can't help you. I sold my villa. I can't even take care of myself now, let alone you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are already an adult. So you'd better look out for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah shouted, "Mom, no. Mom, no one will help me except you. You can't abandon me. They set me up. I didn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, please help me. They will chop off my hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia laughed angrily, "It's only been a few days since I gave you 30 million dollars. Now you ask me for 50 million dollars. Even if I ran a bank, I wouldn't have that much money. Figure it out yourself. If you have to die, do it far away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally understood that Noah was truly hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's sons were good to her no matter how useless they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah shouted, "Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without giving him another chance to speak, she hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her son was over as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell softly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff lay on the bed, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched her faint, and there was nothing he could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to speak but could only make "hmm..." sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he felt helpless and desperate. Looking at Amelia, tears welled up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she was still there for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so miserable and completely useless. He didn't understand why they ended up here.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1013.html">« Prev</a><a href="1015.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
