She smiled, "Diana, you are in a good mood today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised her eyebrows and smiled, "If it weren't for Steven and Queenie affecting my mood, I might be in a better mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of what Paula had done, Diana thought Jeff would make a big fuss.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was really trampling on Jeff's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was indeed furious when he saw what Paula had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went straight to Paula and scolded her on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana happened to see this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana passed by the shopping mall, she wanted to buy a pair of gloves. It was too cold. The cold wind made her hands hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she got out of the car, she saw Jeff meet Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff looked haggard. He looked at Paula with cloudy eyes and roared, "Paula, you disgraced me last night. Today, you let four children take your surname Barnes. They are also my children. What qualifications do you have..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula interrupted him coldly, "Jeff, you have long severed ties with them. Are you dreaming now that you say they are your children?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and that mistress have your child, and you look down on my sons and daughter. Haven't I already helped you to be together? Was it me who caused the incident last night? It was your mistress and your daughter who caused it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are so disgusting. You were with that kind of woman and slept in the same bed with me. I have to go to the hospital for a check-up today. It's really disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff looked embarrassed and trembling with anger. Paula looked good. Although her company was gone, she was much more relaxed than before. From the look in her eyes, he could tell that she was doing well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff felt uncomfortable, thinking, "Shouldn't Paula have been living a bad life after the divorce?Shouldn't she be haggard?Why am I the one who looks haggard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff took a deep breath. He regretted that his life had turned into this. "Paula, I was wrong. How about we remarry? Amelie is not sincere to me at all. I was deceived by her before."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt uncomfortable. He could have countless women, but his woman could only have him as her man.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula frowned and looked at his greasy appearance coldly. She thought, "Before, I have spoiled him. He had everything he wanted every day.It's only been a few days, and he's already regretting it. It's really shameful what he said about true love."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula laughed and mocked, "Jeff, isn't this the result you wanted most after planning for decades? It's only been a few days, and you can't stand it anymore and want to remarry me. I still have a debt of 500 million dollars. Do you want to pay it back for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned. "Didn't you say you have paid it off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone helped me pay off the debt, but I still owe that person. You can remarry me if you want. But you have to help me pay back the 500 million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was excited. "Paula, I knew you are the best. I especially miss the fish you cooked. The clam chowder you made is the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "After the divorce, I often couldn't even have a hot meal.Amelie is very lazy and sleeps until ten in the morning every day.I have to go out and buy breakfast myself.Her gentleness, dignity, and generosity in the past were all pretended in front of me. They all disappeared in just a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff said, "Paula, I was wrong. Queenie is ungrateful. She threatened me. Can we remarry?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="682.html">« Prev</a><a href="684.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
