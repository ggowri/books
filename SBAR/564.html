You're the one who stole the baby! Where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice replied, dripping with smugness, "I'm on a boat out at sea. Just transfer the money to the designated account, and I'll hand the child back to you. If I don't get the million by dawn, your son is as good as gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze turned icy as she stared out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "So that's it. It's all about the money. Penelope has grown so accustomed to Gale's indulgence. Now that without Gale's protection, Penelope is desperate enough to pull something like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind? It's the middle of the night&mdash;the banks aren't even open! How am I supposed to get you 10 million dollars?" Diana shot back, her voice firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Tomorrow morning then. If I don't see the money by then, I'll toss your kid into the ocean to feed the fish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot to her feet, her heart pounding. She rushed to the window, staring into the stormy night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind howled, and snow whipped against the glass, obscuring her view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure the baby is safe?" Diana feigned concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry; I'll take good care of him until I get the cash. Now stop stalling and get that money!" the voice barked before cutting the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage ignited within Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to act fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There must be surveillance footage near room 408," she thought, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly accessed the hospital's security system through a special app on her phone. The internet connection was slow, and it took a few agonizing minutes to log in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she found the footage of Penelope lurking by the room door, taking video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched the video, a red "X" flashed on the screen, indicating that the original footage had been tampered with. "They were prepared for this," she realized, frustration boiling inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recorded the video and promptly sent it to the local police department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her phone was a powerful tool, and she knew it could come in handy in moments like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the footage, she quickly cleared her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can find Penelope, I can find that baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a mess she's gotten herself into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of all the kids to steal, she chose the police chief's child. She's going to regret this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But first, Diana needed to explain everything to the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't shake the feeling of unease. "I wonder why Queenie hasn't cut ties with Penelope yet. Does she still see some value in Penelope?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off the thought, Diana turned her attention to her nephew, who had a rosy little face and was waving his tiny hands in his sleep. His lips pursed, indicating his hunger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled softly and got up to wash the baby bottle, preparing to mix some formula. "With the cops still grilling down below, I'm timing myself to make my way down right after they wrap up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the police department received the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confirming Penelope as a suspect, they decided to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police chief, Felix Jameson, wanting to avoid raising alarms, called in the nurses one by one to identify her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope had been on the island for several days, frequently visiting the hospital to bring lunch to her aunt Rachel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse who recognized her was Freya Miller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked terrified under Felix's intense gaze. "Mr. Jameson, that's Dr. Max's niece. She's been here delivering lunches for the past few days. In fact, the doctors taking care of your wife included Dr. Max.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know, we had two kids kidnapped for ransom last year. After the money was paid, the kids were returned."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="563.html">« Prev</a><a href="565.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
