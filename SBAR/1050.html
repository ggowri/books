Diana took one bite of the steak and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her gently and smiled. "Diana, do you like it? This place has the best food," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was his favorite restaurant in the area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ingredients were incredibly fresh, and the flavors were unique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied cheerfully, "It's delicious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander passed her the foie gras, "This foie gras is really good too. I know you like it. Try it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. "Thank you, Alexander</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The foie gras tasted amazing!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled gently and started eating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the first floor of the restaurant, Nick and Luna were also having dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sat across from each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick looked at Luna and asked, "Luna, do you think Diana will like Mr. Powell? I just feel like Mr. Powell is... complicated. And his business overseas seems messy too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was his first impression of Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna hadn&rsquo;t thought about it that way. She was busy thinking about coming back for the foie gras next time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The foie gras was just too good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna took a bite and said, "Nick, have you ever thought that maybe it's just your male ego talking? Mr. Powell is an outstanding young entrepreneur. Why would you think he has ulterior motives?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And he's always been by Diana's side, helping her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick looked at Luna&rsquo;s indifferent expression, surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "Luna, just my instinct as a man. I&rsquo;m not jealous of Alexander, I just think he&rsquo;s up to no good. I&rsquo;m doing pretty well myself right now, why would I be jealous of him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna thought Alexander was great. Rich, gentle, handsome&mdash;practically perfect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't think so. I think Mr. Powell is perfect for Diana&mdash;handsome and rich." Luna still thought Alexander was great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick shook his head and said, "Luna, I know as a woman, you admire capable and handsome men. But as a man, I understand men very well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna thought, "Alexander hasn&rsquo;t done anything to hurt Diana. Nick&rsquo;s probably overthinking it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna placed half a fish in front of him and said, "Eat. Stop talking."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling wronged, Nick muttered, "Women blinded by a man's looks are terrifying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dinner ended pleasantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander offered to drive Diana home, but she declined. "Alexander, you just got back from your trip. Go get some rest. Luna and Nick will take me home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sighed and said, "Fine! I'll walk you to the car."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked her down the stairs, still chatting happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their conversation was interrupted by a mocking voice. "Diana, another man tonight? Looks like you can't survive without one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at Dylan and said, "Dylan, my business is none of your concern."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shot a cold glance at Dylan, Queenie, and "Steven" as they walked over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was still sitting in her wheelchair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had no idea about the things between Steven and George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Dylan and said, "Dylan, watch your mouth. Insulting your own sister? That's just despicable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan said, "She took over Steven's company. Isn't that ruthless?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned and said, "That's because Steven was stupid. He gave up everything for his mistress. Dylan, why don't you ask Queenie and Steven why the company ended up with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you trying to make Steven's loss of his fortune over his mistress public?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After everything, you still haven't learned your lesson."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and George had long known how sharp Diana's tongue could be, yet every time, she still managed to leave them trembling with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood behind Diana, struggling to hold back a laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan snapped angrily, "You cripple, stop talking nonsense!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Queenie and George standing behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George was still limping, and Queenie was sitting in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smirked, "Why don't you take a look behind you and see who's really the cripple?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was left speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you're shameless!" he snapped, his face flushing with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered, "Idiot. Next time you see me, don't talk to me. I don't want my friends knowing I even know you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Alexander and said, "Alexander, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander guided Diana away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until the elevator doors closed that Dylan snapped out of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Queenie in the wheelchair and asked, "Queenie, does she always bully you like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie gave a bitter smile, "Dylan, I took her place. Diana has every right to hate me. If </span><span>we</span><span> hadn't been switched, </span><span>you should dote</span><span> her, not me. I can understand why she treats me this way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Queenie, don't you ever think like that again. You did nothing wrong," Dylan said firmly. "Steven, don't you hate Diana? Can't you do something to put her in her place?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George frowned and said, "It's not the right time yet. Stay out of this. When the time comes, I'll take back everything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan asked, "Steven, what do you mean by the right time? I want to help you. Can you tell me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1049.html">« Prev</a><a href="1051.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
