Damn it, this bastard had finally found a way to threaten her.</span><span> </span><span>Even after reliving her life and signing divorce papers, she still couldn't escape Steven's grip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just you wait!" Diana grumbled as she stomped upstairs to change into something more comfortable, her mind racing to find a way out of this mess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A confrontation with Steven wasn't the right move, not yet. His fate was in Queenie's hands. For now, she would play along, be the pawn in their game.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just one meal, after all. It wasn't like she hadn't done this before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana returned to the room she had previously occupied. Everything inside was as she had left it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was her first time back since her rebirth, yet she felt no attachment whatsoever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once your heart's done, it was amazing how easily you could let go of everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She rummaged through the closet, throwing on some comfy clothes and swapping out her shoes for a cozier pair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sent messages to Leopold and Tobias.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Grandpa, don't worry about me. I'm fine. I'll be back soon.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold: [Is that jerk Steven giving you trouble?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: [Grandpa, he can't bother me anymore. It's okay, I can take care of myself.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias: [Remember to call me if anything happens.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: [Of course! I'll definitely bug you if I need anything, Tobias.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled as she tucked her phone into her pocket, then grabbed her bag and headed downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't look at Steven but instead went straight to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't like outsiders coming in. Usually, it was just the two of them at home, but most of the time, she was alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew her way around the place by now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She found some pumpkins in the fridge. After prepping them, she set them to stew and then started cooking pasta for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat on the couch, looking over some documents, occasionally glancing up at the kitchen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the warm light, watching her busy figure, he felt a sense of peace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forty minutes later, she had finished all the dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that she'd finished making dinner, Steven got up and went over to eat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana crouched down to get glasses from the cabinet. As she poured water, she fumbled, dropping her glass. It shattered on the floor - her smiling face on the custom couple's mug now in pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt an inexplicable pang in her heart. She'd specially made those couple mugs for them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She and Steven each got one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over and saw the broken mug with Diana's photo on it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven crouched down to look, then pulled out another mug from the cabinet. It was identical to the one Diana had broken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This mug had his photo printed on it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven froze, looking at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana kept her eyes down, not meeting his gaze. She stared at the broken pieces on the floor, her voice calm. "I had these couple mugs made on our third day of marriage. I guess they knew we were getting divorced, so this one just broke on its own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How lovely!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana picked up the pieces and tossed them in the trash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had never seen these mugs before. She'd actually gone and had them made.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her say it was lovely, his eyes darkened. "Diana, a mug with so much meaning breaks, and you tell me it's lovely?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said nothing. Instead, she found two other mugs and made coffee for them both.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was thirsty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't have to stay here tonight. Queenie would be here soon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come eat," Diana called, dishing up a bowl of soup for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at the trash can before heading to the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat across from her and said in a tone that brooked no argument, "You're eating too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was already full and couldn't eat more. "No need. I'm stuffed. And don't worry, I didn't poison your food. I have too much respect for cooking to mess with it like that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven trusted her on that point, at least.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He picked up the bowl of soup and took a sip. The familiar taste washed over him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the spread of home-cooked dishes, he polished off two full-bowl dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he set down his fork, he watched Diana sipping her coffee with her head down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I was wrong to doubt you before. From now on, I'll try to trust..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There is no 'from now on.' I'm quitting tomorrow. I refuse to let you manipulate me. Do you think you can tear me to shreds, and I'll come running back with a simple 'my bad'?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'd rather die than stay with you. That's where I stand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought to herself, "He thinks he can threaten me? Dream on."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze darkened instantly. The air grew frigid, the atmosphere suffocating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana..." Steven's voice was tight.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="77.html">« Prev</a><a href="79.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
