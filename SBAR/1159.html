I have no confidence in the overseas investments."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now she's short on funds, unable to invest further in the overseas projects, and unsure about handling the follow-up work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "Alright! Tell them we're pulling out the investment."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this $1 billion, she can plan again in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario's phone rang. It was a call from his assistant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He answered the call.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Powell, we've been scammed. After the $1 billion was transferred, their company went bankrupt and they ran away. All their registration information is fake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Mario took a few steps back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible. How could this be a scam?" Without that $1 billion, their company's future operations would become much harder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie suddenly stood up, grabbed his collar, and asked, "Mario, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario's phone fell to the ground, and he trembled as he said, "Queenie, the overseas project is a scam. Our money is gone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sank back into the chair again, her face pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had actually been deceived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George was right; she was gradually losing everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Paula's office, she looked at the billion dollars in the overseas account and smiled, "Queenie, everything you owe me, I've taken it all back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric looked at her and smiled, "Mom, so there's so much to learn in business. I really learned a lot this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula sat by the window gracefully and said, "Eric, you still have a lot to learn. I'll teach you slowly in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric confidently said, "Mom, I will learn well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was just sad; her daughter would never come back to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This billion dollars was her wedding gift to Queenie. At that time, she truly loved Queenie, so she gave her a lot of money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Paula has taken all the money back. From now on, this money will belong to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula regrettably thought, "I was the one who pushed Diana away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana is in a good mood today. She took Steven to a restaurant for lunch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chose a restaurant with a great location.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After lunch, Diana dozed off on the armchair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was kept up late by Steven last night and is now very tired. As long as she has a place to sit, she can fall asleep quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Steven was full, he saw an urgent document on his phone. He sipped his coffee while going through the file. Over 10 minutes later, he replied to the message and then looked up at Diana across from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had already fallen asleep. Her sleeping face was very peaceful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven put away his phone and smiled helplessly. She really can fall asleep anywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gracefully stood up, walked over, put Diana's phone into his bag, and then picked her up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His movements were gentle, and Diana remained sound asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lowered his head, kissed her forehead, and carried her downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He placed her in the passenger seat, adjusted the seat to recline, so she could sleep comfortably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven just received a message, learning that Queenie's investments abroad were all scams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a trap set by Paula.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The olive branch Steven offered, Queenie didn't take; instead, she believed Paula's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sneered. Queenie is gradually losing everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie took two hours to come out. Her company is gradually heading toward ruin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I've worked so hard, so why did I fail? Why was I deceived?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie slowly stood up. Mario quickly walked over to support her. He said, "Queenie, I have another solution."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie heard his words, and it felt like she saw her last hope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said excitedly, "What solution?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario smiled, "Queenie, do you remember Diana's new product? They postponed its launch by half a year, which gives us an opportunity. Chloe can provide the new product to us. As long as we sell this medical treatment system, we can still make billions of dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie almost forgot about this matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Have Chloe prepare immediately. I can find a buyer very soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario called Chloe. He had given her a house and money before, all for today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chloe, bring out the data you prepared earlier, along with Diana's computer. I'll give you another hundred million dollars so you'll never have to worry about anything again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe was thrilled. "Great, darling. Today is the perfect opportunity. They're all out of the research lab. I'll grab the computer and meet you right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "Alright! Let's meet at the same club as last time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe exclaimed excitedly, "Alright, I'll be there right away. We've tested this system internally, and it works incredibly well, worth at least 2 billion dollars. If your company develops it on its own, it will bring limitless wealth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario smiled and said, "Alright! I'll give you more money then. Hurry over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe quietly left the lab.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The newly awakened Diana received a call from Joseph.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was still a bit groggy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, are you awake? I'll take you to see a good show," Joseph said gently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked around, unsure how she got back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, send me the address. I'll be there soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph said, "Alright, Diana. Bring the police. This time, Mario is going to jail."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned. Last time, she told them there was a traitor in the lab. It seems they've found out who it is.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said seriously, "Joseph, I'm coming right away. You can't let them escape. I've spent nearly four years developing this system. If it hadn't been delayed before, they wouldn't have had this chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph gently comforted her, "Diana, don't worry. I won't let them escape. You come over first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hung up the phone and looked around the room. Steven wasn't there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She put on her shoes and went to find Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was folding roses in the study. Hearing the door open, he put the paper down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He opened the study door and saw Diana, who was about to knock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently said, "Diana, you're awake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded and said, "Steven, I remember you have a police friend. Can you call him and come out with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Don't worry. What's going on?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1158.html">« Prev</a><a href="1160.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
