You don't have to go to Alexander," Steven said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It felt strange, like someone had taken away something precious to him, leaving his heart heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "No need. The only thing I want is a divorce. Alexander is easy to get along with. Now I understand that when someone cares about you, they're more afraid of you getting hurt than themselves. He treats me well and never lets me suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you&hellip; you only make me suffer. Steven, you clearly love Queenie so much, so why did you suddenly refuse to divorce?" Diana asked, her clear eyes fixed on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven also looked at her quietly. He had always known that Diana was more beautiful than Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that Alexander meant that much to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's heart ached dully. The feeling was unbearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Queenie left back then, he was only angry. It hadn't hurt like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I've reached my limit of disappointment and decided to walk away. You've always wanted to push me away, so now I'm asking you to do it. I'm not trying to play hard to get or make a scene. I just truly want a divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana hadn't made a fuss about Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't the right time to cause a scene. Exposing Queenie as the mistress now would only hurt Diana herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she did that, how would she be any different from someone like Queenie?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would make sure Queenie got what she deserved, but in her own way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stared at her for a moment, then changed the topic. "Grandma says she misses you and wants you to join her for dinner tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew Helen had always been kind to her. Throughout the marriage, both the elders treated her well. Helen often sent her gifts and cooked for her on weekends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She loved cakes, and the ones made by the chef at the mansion were the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She always got to have some when she visited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can join Grandma for dinner, but you can't come. I don't want to go with you. They'll eventually find out, and I've been gone for over six months. Grandma is a strong woman. She's likely already figured out our issues. I'll explain everything to her tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, do you really like Alexander that much? Are you divorcing me for him?" Steven's calm expression finally broke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head, her face full of disappointment. "Steven, you and Queenie are the same. I'm only 'right' when I let you control and insult me. I'm suddenly wrong and dirty when I stand up for myself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to end this relationship, and you accuse me of being with other men. Steven, how blind was I to have loved someone like you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven pressed his lips together, the answer all too clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I don't even want you anymore, so why should I keep loving you?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="301.html">« Prev</a><a href="303.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
