Her tone was cool, almost playful. "Sure, I can hand it over. But it'll cost you five billion. If you're willing to fork out that much, the land's yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the land would be worth twice as much soon enough, far beyond that in a few years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Five billion? Diana, are you insane?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking grin crept onto </span><span>Diana</span><span> face. "Look who's talking. Aren't you basically trying to rob me? You're all head over heels for Queenie, saying you'd die for her, but </span><span>when it comes to </span><span>five billion? Guess your love's got a price tag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered the last life too well. Eric, the man standing here now, had ended up dead at the hands of Queenie's hired killers, </span><span>and </span><span>his body vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, tied to Steven, Diana couldn't do anything about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd watched as Eric, with his unfailing loyalty and blind sense of righteousness, was destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man always thought he was right, and nothing could change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had placed a woman next to each of the Marsh brothers to tighten her grip on the Marsh and Barnes families. But Eric was the only one left untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his face twisted with a bitter sneer as he looked at her, his voice low and full of venom. "Diana, I'll always put Queenie first. Nothing you do will ever change that. I'll never care about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. The thought of you caring is sickening. Eric, remember those three days you had that raging fever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed. "You think bringing that up will make me grateful to you? I'd rather die than </span><span>call</span><span> you my sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, disappointed by his arrogance. He was so caught up in his own delusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just so you know, that fever was from a severe kidney infection. You were one step away from uremia. If I hadn't stepped in, you'd be long gone. I treated you with meds that cost three million each. I gave you three of them. That's nine million. If anything, I've more than repaid you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So let's be clear. We're not family anymore, so kindly stay out of my life." Her last words carried a tinge of resignation, as though she'd finally accepted that some bonds weren't meant to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! Who do you think you are, Diana? Trying to trick me with this nine-million nonsense. It was the doctors who saved me, not you. You think you're some kind of doctor?" Eric's gaze turned vicious. "And today, you're giving us that land whether you want to or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana only felt pity. This man was beyond help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? Diana, you've finally come to your senses?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="451.html">« Prev</a><a href="453.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
