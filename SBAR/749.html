Yvette knew that Steven was a quiet person, so she didn't notice that he was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another thing was that she was determined to get Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was nothing to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Steven had a wife, she was sure she could win his heart and soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her, with a meaningful smile on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His deep eyes were sharp, and after a while, his cold voice slowly rang out. "Ms. King, you might as well donate your corneas!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Yvette heard that, she was confused. "What does he mean?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she looked at Steven, she found that he had a blank expression on his face, his sexy lips slightly pursed, and he was so cold that no one dared to approach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if people like Steven didn't speak, they were intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette took a deep breath to encourage herself. Once they became familiar with each other, Steven would be easy to get.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them entered the room and saw Owen inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lounged in the chair, looking meaningfully at the two people who came in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a coincidence! How come you two are here together?" he asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette glanced at Steven happily before explaining, "We met in the parking lot and came up together."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's kind of predestined. Let's order some food. I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen handed the menu to Yvette and asked her to order first.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced sideways at Steven beside him and found that his face looked grim. "Tsk, what happened to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not even interested in such a beautiful woman like Yvette?" Owen wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next door, the dishes had been served.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Alexander had met many times. They were familiar with each other and could talk to each other easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were talking about fashion design.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After lunch, Diana gave Alexander the spring design drawings and said, "Alexander, there are 20 styles for this year's spring collection. Take a look at the styles first. If you are not satisfied, we can discuss it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been busy doing that these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took the design drawings from her hands and was surprised at the first look. He quickly read through the design drawings and was greatly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were styles that had never been seen before on the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The style of each piece of clothing could become a unique one among high-end brands.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Diana with eyes full of amazement. "Who said she was just a wild girl from the country?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can a wild girl have such great talent?" Alexander thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were shining brightly as he said, "Diana, I'm very satisfied with these design drawings. Leave the rest to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was relieved to have met Alexander's standard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'll participate in a fashion design competition in a few days. I was tricked by Queenie into doing that. Actually, I have an idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana told Alexander about her idea. After listening, Alexander smiled and nodded. "Diana, just do what you want. However, what pen name will you use in our company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Laurel."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was slightly stunned. He seemed to have heard the name somewhere, but he couldn't remember it for the moment.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="748.html">« Prev</a><a href="750.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
