"Alexander, thank you for treating me to dinner tonight, but my divorce is my top priority right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander looked at her worriedly. "If you have any problem, feel free to call me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled calmly. "Okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She unbuckled her seatbelt and got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at her smiling happily at other men, and the anger in his eyes was about to turn into reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Diana got off the car, Alexander drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Steven was about to make trouble, Diana's phone rang again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and called out, "Grandpa."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold smiled happily. "Diana, come to the bar across the street. Hurry up, there's something great going on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked across.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was surprised. "Grandpa, you're going to have fun in the bar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tsk, do you think young people are the only ones allowed in bars? Besides, I'm not old. Come here, come here quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana hung up the phone, feeling speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana pointed to the opposite side and said, "I'll go to the opposite side. My grandfather is over there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana left after saying this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven followed her. "I'll go see your grandpa too. After all, I'm your husband."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought Steven was weird.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Diana entered, she saw Leopold. Leopold seemed not to have seen Steven and pulled Diana over to trot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, look, I have personally picked out ten male models for you. They are six feet tall and each has eight-pack abs. They are all very handsome, aren't they? Are they good enough to serve you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Leopold finished speaking, Diana felt a chill on her back and her scalp tingled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew very well where this chill came from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was radiating from Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at Diana's back and thought, "Diana wanted to find a male model, even ten?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was very irritable, and his anger and brutality were terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't dare to look back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She walked forward and saw ten handsome men in white shirts. Each of them was very handsome, and they were all the type of young men she liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at the first one, and grinned at him. She poked his abdominal muscles on his chest, and smiled charmingly. "How many years have you been practicing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her voice was gentle and sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven cast a sharp gaze at Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana retracted her fingers involuntarily, and she felt that her fingertips suddenly felt a little painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man smiled calmly. "Ten years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Great, I'm very satisfied with your figure." Diana was very satisfied. He thought that choosing them as models would definitely be a good choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at them one by one, smiling. She was very satisfied with the top-quality male models that her grandfather found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leopold walked over and asked with a smile, "Diana, are you satisfied?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and nodded, then looked at them one by one. She couldn't help but nodded. "Satisfied, very satisfied."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not far away, Penelope saw this scene. She quickly took a video and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought, "Diana, just wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope left happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven, who was not far away, walked over. She took Diana's hand, and asked angrily, "Diana, how much do you need men that you ordered ten male models at once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His voice was filled with anger and he was very furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's hand was pinched by Steven and it hurt. She frowned and looked at him. "Let go of me, don't let your dirty hands touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You..." Steven looked at the ten male models, and each of them was really handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, "Diana likes this type? Girlish!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It looks like they have some abdominal muscles, but they don't look good enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at the ten male models and asked, "My grandfather has told you the rules. If you are willing, you can sign a contract with my company. There will be a fashion show at the end of the year, and there will be special teachers to train you. If you are willing, you can come to me to sign the contract tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All ten male models nodded happily and said in unison, "Thank you, Miss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana waved her hand and let them go first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did Steven realize that he had misunderstood Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sorry, Diana, I thought..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What do you think? Do you think I'm as lowly as you and Queenie?" Diana shook off his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Leopold, who was looking at Steven with sharp eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You bastard, stay away from my granddaughter." Leopold was angry and full of vigor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned and looked at Leopold. He thought, "Who is this old man?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="161.html">« Prev</a><a href="163.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
