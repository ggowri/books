After Steven had thrown her into the ocean, Queenie had fallen gravely ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She barely managed to recover after IV treatment. As soon as she could walk again, she rushed to find Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Evan was alive, Queenie felt there was nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two men would take the blame, and without evidence, Steven wouldn't target her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she arrived, she overheard Diana speaking. She even recorded it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wouldn't let any opportunity slip by. She was determined to drag Diana into hell and emerge as the sole winner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her calmly. She couldn't understand how Queenie dared to say such things. "Queenie, Gale is not only your half-brother but someone who's spoiled you since childhood. If you can hurt him, why can't I refuse to get involved with someone like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, stop accusing me. I had nothing to do with what happened to Gale," Queenie retorted defensively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she regretted not running Gale over completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want him healthy. She knew he'd cause trouble if he recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You know you're lying," Diana said, not bothering to argue further. Instead, she turned to Tom. "Tom, let's grab dinner. I'm starving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom glanced at her pale face and gently ruffled her hair. "Sure. My treat. Let's eat something nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without sparing another glance at Steven or Queenie, Diana and Tom walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched Diana's retreating figure, his lips pressed into a tight line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned. She hadn't expected the hospital director to be Diana's acquaintance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much is Diana hiding from us?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time to dwell on it. She turned to Steven. "Steven, about Evan's kidnapping, I didn't mean for it to happen. Evan is fine now, and those two men have already turned themselves in. I never ordered them to take him." Queenie had come to clarify this matter to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's gaze turned cold as he finally looked at her. The icy aura he exuded made Queenie tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I truly underestimated how vicious you could be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze, panic flashing across her face. She knew Steven wasn't just angry; he was furious. "Steven, what do you mean by that? I was just retaliating after being bullied. How does that make me vicious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice wavered as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven chuckled faintly, but there was something menacing and ruthless in his smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I mean? Queenie, I've indulged you again and again, and every time, you repay me by hurting the people I care about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... Steven, I'm sorry! About Evan, I truly didn't mean for it to happen. Paige keeps insulting me. I just couldn't take it anymore and wanted to teach her a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hadn't expected Steven to find out about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his icy demeanor, she felt like she was losing her mind. She felt she was about to lose Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I realize I was wrong. I truly do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie apologized anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gestured toward Paige's hospital room. "The person you need to apologize to is Paige. What good does apologizing to me do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Steven turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's apologetic expression instantly twisted into one of venomous rage. "Steven, how dare you treat me like this? Do you think you can get away with showing me that attitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking voice interrupted her. "Queenie, your ability to switch faces so quickly is truly impressive. No wonder we all believed in your so-called kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie whipped around to see Gale sitting in his wheelchair alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that if he was here, then he must have overheard Diana's earlier conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gale, you worthless cripple. Even Diana won't save you. How do you have the nerve to keep living?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone as pathetic as you should just rot in hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale let out a low chuckle. "You're right. Someone like me probably does belong in hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Queenie, I'll watch as you spiral into ruin. I'll watch as you fall into hell yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana lives a life far more genuine and sincere than yours. At least she cared for us with an honest heart, unlike your shallow pretense of goodness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that day comes, the day you hit rock bottom, I'll throw a party to celebrate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Queenie's face twisted with rage, but a sudden thought made her pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You came here to ask Diana to operate on you. Can she even perform surgery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale narrowed his eyes, suspicious of her intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether Diana can or not is none of your business," he replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already heard everything. Diana refusing to operate on him wasn't a surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he understood how foolish he'd been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was to recover, to take care of his mother and Diana. She might not need his care, but he still wanted to be a good brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, Diana warned me not to join the competition. I didn't listen, and that's why I ended up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if that man took the blame for you, Queenie, you can go on living as if nothing happened. But your good days are numbered. Your luck is running out fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll never meet a good end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale showed a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's body trembled violently. She shook her head frantically. "No, Gale. You'll never live to see that day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned and stormed into Paige's hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was awake and chatting with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana left, she had promised to bring Paige dinner. When Queenie entered, Paige quickly texted Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, Queenie is here.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied promptly: [You're in the hospital. She won't dare do anything. Don't be afraid.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige looked at Queenie calmly. "Why are you here, Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie walked over arrogantly and stood in front of her. "Paige, locking you in the storage room was just to teach you a lesson. I know I was wrong, and I'll make it up to you. Anything you want, as long as you don't press charges."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige chuckled bitterly at her words. "Pressing charges and sending you to jail would be too easy. Rest assured, I'll make sure you pay for everything you've done to me, piece by piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered at Paige's innocent and naive words. She couldn't fathom where Paige found the confidence to think she could fight back. "Paige..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of today, the evidence is clear. Transfer one million dollars to my account, and I'll consider this incident settled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige suddenly smiled brightly, cutting Queenie off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew that she couldn't make a big deal out of it now. If her malicious side were known to the public, everything would be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfect persona was no longer perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, Paige. Problems that can be solved with money aren't real problems. But honestly, you're cheap. Just one million dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige wasn't offended. Her smile grew wider. "Since you put it that way, one million dollars do seem too little. Let's make it 10 million dollars instead."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="870.html">« Prev</a><a href="872.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
