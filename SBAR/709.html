Did Diana tell Steven?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana used to silently swallow her pain, suffering alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Steven, I'm not pregnant at all; she's the one lying. Steven, she's just trying to discredit me. Don't believe what Diana says. I really am not pregnant; it's all her slandering me. She sees that I'm doing better now, and she wants to ruin me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By saying this and then clarifying it later, she could turn the tables, and Diana would still not escape her scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was very displeased. Standing by the window and looking at the snowy scene outside, Queenie's reaction proved that he had been nothing but a fool all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout his life, he had been cautious and prudent, only to be completely manipulated by Queenie over a falsely claimed act of life-saving kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, enough is enough." After Steven gave a cold warning, he hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's plot wouldn't stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where had Andrew been after he left Capitole?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whereabouts were always secretive, and none of his people could find out which mistress he went to.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father favored all the children born to his mistresses, but he did not like the one born to his wife. However, Steven did not value his father's favor anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly froze, realizing that in Diana's eyes, he was no different from his despicable father.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, Andrew, and the man behind her were closely connected.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had already escaped her control, Queenie would make a move against him next.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Diana, just wait a little longer. When the time comes, I will explain everything to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood by the window for a while, then went downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana also efficiently tidied up the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning around, she saw Steven standing at the kitchen door. She was slightly taken aback; in fact, apart from the topic of him and Queenie, it seemed they had nothing else to talk about.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave off a strong sense of distance. With her head down, she walked past Steven. Just as they were about to pass each other, Steven grabbed her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was suddenly startled and tried to shake off his hand. However, she failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned and said coldly, "Steven, get off your hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath, reminiscing about the half year when he couldn't stand up, and the times she would push him out for walks. Often, it was her talking while he listened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a nice voice with a pleasant smile, so carefree and happy all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, her happiness gradually infected his depressed heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that time, because he was blind and his legs were disabled, he was in low spirits and didn't remember much of the stories and words she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only remembered that Diana was chattering with joy all day long.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, she took good care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandparents really liked her, and she was very good at winning people's affection. However, after Queenie returned, all her care and concern were misinterpreted. Her kindness was wrongly defined as ill-intentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to their preference for Queenie, everyone held hostility towards Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just as Diana had anticipated, the members of the Marsh family began to experience a series of unexpected incidents.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale lost his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's company went bankrupt, while the only one who remained unscathed was Eric. Steven thought, "So, will Queenie still make a move against Eric?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="708.html">« Prev</a><a href="710.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
