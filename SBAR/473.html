Can I learn to swim in spring?" Swimming in the cold winter wasn't exactly a good idea. Besides, as the dean of the hospital, he had a lot on his plate and spent long hours there every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, "Tom, you've been trying to learn to swim for years and still can't do it. You might as well give up! Just wait on the shore while I catch fish for you. </span><span>Just l</span><span>et me know what you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The grouper is the best! I'll take you fishing next spring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could tell he wanted to go, but he was a bit timid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tom learned to drive, he failed three times before finally getting his license. He could handle a scalpel just fine, but a steering wheel? Not so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Diana asked him to relax, and that did the trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom grinned, "That's awesome, but I still want to dive on my own. Alright, then, I'll leave you to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned to leave, he saw Joseph standing there, looking solid and imposing. Tom sized him up; he was taller and had a better physique, making him a tough competitor. "Joseph, stay here with Diana. If she needs anything, help her out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph nodded. "Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Tom left, Joseph got some water for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here you go, Diana," he said, offering her the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. "Thanks, Joseph. There's a straw in the bedside table. Can you grab it for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!" Joseph found the straw, opened the package, and put it in the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held it out for her. Diana tilted her head and took a couple of sips, feeling relief as the cool water soothed her dry throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. Thank you!" Diana smiled at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph frowned. "Diana, I saw the news. That guy who hit you was really arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised that it had made the headlines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Did they say who it was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's Samuel Farley from the Farley family." Joseph had seen the online buzz about Samuel's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana connected the dots immediately. Samuel's father, Wyatt Farley, had always had ambitions for the Farley family. After she saved Rita from a near-fatal accident, she had thwarted Wyatt's plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense now why Samuel had attacked her&mdash;he had been waiting for a chance, and today just happened to be it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She noticed Joseph's anger and smiled to reassure him. "I'm fine, really. I just have a personal vendetta with him, and once that's done, everything will be alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Cecil's anxious voice came from the doorway. "Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression shifted to one of clear hostility at Cecil's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil saw Joseph and was momentarily taken aback. "Diana, why is there another pretty guy around you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt as if she were being accused of playing the field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about? He's my friend, Joseph," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your friend? How come I didn't know you had such a good-looking friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil frowned. He didn't like Joseph who was as attractive as him; it stirred a sense of competition within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an undeniable tension between men in situations like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Diana was surrounded by handsome guys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and looked at Joseph. He was indeed dashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Cecil and asked, "Did you come here because of the news?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="472.html">« Prev</a><a href="474.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
