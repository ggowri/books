"Diana, are you okay?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana shut her eyes in discomfort, feeling nauseous. How could she not feel awful?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil watched as several men began to unbuckle their pants, rage filling his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Boss, we don't need anyone else. We can handle this beauty just fine. If you're not interested, step aside," one of the men said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Come on, Boss, we're all young and full of energy. We need a woman's touch," another man added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man looked at them, speechless, his tone full of disdain. "You guys are real scumbags, you can't control your urges anywhere you go. Fine. Getting others involved would expose us. Go ahead. I'll take pictures from the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This place is secluded. Enjoy yourselves," he sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man gave Diana a sinister smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's face showed disgust. Damn it, Queenie liked these kinds of tactics, but Diana would make sure to give her a taste of her own medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One of the men had already stripped and was walking toward Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Get away from her! Don't touch her!" Cecil shouted angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Smack..." The man slapped Cecil hard. Seeing his face more stunning than a woman's, a wicked interest filled his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Kid, I'm into both men and women. Your turn is coming," the man sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil thought,&nbsp;"My ears have been violated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man grabbed Diana roughly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's body was weak, and she couldn't even stand steadily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana let out a cold laugh. Queenie's tactics were truly vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had thought that she and Cecil would be thrown into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she hadn't expected them to drug her, or that Cecil would be dragged into this kidnapping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man started tearing Diana's clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Bastard, stop!" Cecil tried to pull the man away, but he was too weak to help Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He struggled desperately to stand up but failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana watched as the man's face got closer, feeling so disgusted that she forcefully leaned back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why isn't Luna here yet?"&nbsp;she wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Bang..." The sound of a bullet cutting through the air rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man holding Diana was shot in the arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man froze for a moment before realizing he'd been shot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Staring at his bleeding hand, he turned around in panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, he was suddenly kicked hard in the back, falling to the ground with a heavy thud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His penis was crushed under a brutal stomp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah... ugh..." The most excruciating pain struck him, his head buzzing with the agony of near-death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's iron-hard foot kicked him forcefully in the groin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man rolled his eyes back in pain, his eyes bloodshot, and he fainted from fear and agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven turned around, glaring at the man taking photos, and threw a heavy punch at his face.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="184.html">« Prev</a><a href="186.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
