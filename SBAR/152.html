Diana smiled, "By the way, the steak was delicious, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander was very happy to see that she liked it. "Diana, if you like it, I will send some to you tomorrow. It is imported from abroad and is the best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you. My grandfather likes it too." Diana thought, "Since grandfather also likes it, I will receive it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander left. Diana looked at Steven and said, "I won't go to the hospital. Just regard me as a stranger. Please don't bother me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, why are you so heartless? Queenie committed suicide because of what happened today. Isn't today's incident caused by you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was furious. He thought, "To other men, she smiles sweetly, but to me, she is so indifferent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana frowned. She couldn't suppress her anger and yelled, "You bastard, how could you blame me? You know the relationship between Queenie and the Gall family better than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And, are you blind? You always think that anything that happens to Queenie is my fault. I didn't do anything wrong, but it's my fault?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Gale let Harry Gall bully me, and Queenie asked Harry to rape me. You made me pay for her suicide? Are you kidding me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, if you dare to force me again, I will expose your relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Anyway, I've already been killed by you two bitches once. Death is painful. If it happens again, I'm not afraid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana raised her phone and clicked on the screen. It was playing a video, which was a video of Queenie and Harry having sex in a hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, you are so beautiful. I love you so much. Don't worry. I will teach Diana a good lesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I wonder if Steven will be jealous when he knows you are so beautiful under me," Harry said madly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ahhh... Harry, this is the last time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "She is not as perfect as you imagined, right? Do you feel disgusted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You think they are disgusting, and I see that you two are just as disgusting as them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you know why I didn't show this video to the public? Because I want to watch with my own eyes that Queenie send you all to hell one by one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana became angrier. "So, do you think Queenie is willing to die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Diana finished speaking, she entered the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at her back and asked, "Diana, how did you get these videos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana stopped and turned to look at Steven, "What? Do you think the video is synthesized? You are wrong. You can check the hotel check-in records. It happened lately, you can check it at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But Queenie is also a computer expert. You may not be able to find any clues. Every time I am framed by you, she can show evidence every time. Part of the evidence is forged by her, but you idiots never think it clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She can plot against me in secret. Why can't I?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you know why she wants me to die? Because I know a lot of her secrets. I must die, and you have always been her accomplice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled sadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just now he saw Diana chatting with Alexander and Steven became impulsive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sentence "Queenie committed suicide because of you" pushed Diana further away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven turned around and got in the car angrily. He told Evan, "Go back to the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was stunned. "Going back to the company?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="151.html">« Prev</a><a href="153.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
