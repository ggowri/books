I took care of you diligently for two years, but you never once considered my feelings. You always took everyone else's feelings into account but never mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was Queenie's departure my doing? I knew you liked her, and I didn't want to marry you. But you were willing to marry a woman you didn't love for the sake of your inheritance. And after marrying me, you let everyone else trample over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were willing to overlook all of Queenie's mistakes and share her with other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every time you ask, and every time I answer, I grow tired of repeating myself. Please stop asking. Once there's a rift between people, it's nearly impossible to go back to the way things were. You may be able to move past those things, but I can't because I was the one who bore all the pain and suffering, not you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the abuser, you and others around you think that I'm supposed to endure this. But from the start to the end, I've always been the victim. Did you ever even see me in your eyes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana spoke, tears silently fell down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced out at the snowstorm outside the window and let out a cold laugh. "Steven, do you know how ridiculous I felt? Every time I saw you protecting Queenie, it made me furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was that anger, born from feeling unloved, that made me vulnerable."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when I finally became calm, it was because I no longer loved you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked up, staring at him with a dazed expression. "Just as you said earlier. I'm not worthy of loving you. And you're right. I'm not worthy because when I'm with you, I feel like a resentful woman. You've only ever responded to me with harsh words. We were never meant to be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know there's an agreement, and soon, the three years will be up. When that time comes, I hope you'll willingly go with me to finalize the divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana figured that maybe she hadn't been clear enough in her previous attempts to communicate this. But this time, she laid everything out plainly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt immense sadness, knowing that this was the only man she had ever loved in two lifetimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew what he went through as a child and had empathized with him. She put her heart and soul into caring for him, trying to make him feel loved. But Steven didn't need her love.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loving alone was too exhausting. She gave him everything, only to be met with indifference. The last shred of dignity she had left, she wanted to keep for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was taken aback. He pressed his lips together, silently watching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, strong in both love and hatred, was always so rational.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "She's cried, she's laughed, and now, has she finally reached the end of her patience with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always believed she was just being stubborn, throwing a tantrum, and that, eventually, she'd come back to him. Because in the past, Diana's eyes had been filled with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he didn't understand love, he could feel her love and kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was clear that she truly didn't love him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed his eyes. It wasn't that she stopped loving him; it was that he had pushed her away himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a low voice, he said, "Get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and walked out, his tall figure appearing defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked in confusion, watching him leave. Her long lashes still held lingering, glistening tears, and she rubbed her eyes with a bit of uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Steven would have berated her for being shameless or making a scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he hadn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Steven, who couldn't tolerate even a speck of dirt, he had managed to endure all of Queenie's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distinction between love and not loving was indeed easy to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying back down, Diana let out a bitter laugh. "What is this? Those wounds have already been carved deep into my core; there's no going back. We can't go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Talking to herself, she realized how uncomfortable her eyes felt after crying&mdash;sticky and swollen. She went to the bathroom, splashed her face with cold water, and returned to bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana swallowed all the bitterness and closed her eyes to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the adjacent room, Steven was deeply shaken by Diana's words.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="664.html">« Prev</a><a href="666.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
