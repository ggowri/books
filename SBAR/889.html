"That's why I didn't want a divorce. I realized Diana doesn't need my protection. She can toy with you effortlessly, making your life miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we hadn't divorced and she'd stayed by my side, I might never have seen her full potential. But without me, she's become even more captivating, making it impossible for me to let her go. You've always prided yourself on being a master of everything&mdash;music, chess, art, and literature&mdash;while mocking Diana as a country bumpkin. But the real clown here is you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the situation abroad resolved, Steven saw no reason to hold back any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't act, the other side would keep hiding like a cowardly turtle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the truth was out, the person behind it all couldn't stay calm anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had suspected something but never expected it to involve another son of Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the extravagant city-wide fireworks and public proposal weren't for the woman Andrew truly loved&mdash;it might all have been a ruse to escape his uncle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man looked exactly like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven needed to quickly deal with Queenie's schemes. He couldn't let them delay his efforts to win Diana back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie heard the truth, she was instantly devastated, frozen in place as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in disbelief and terror. She had thought their plan was flawless, capable of deceiving everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never imagined that all her meticulous scheming had been exposed from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His deep eyes showed no trace of pity&mdash;only a cold indifference and biting mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips trembled as she tried to defend herself, but any words she could muster felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body shook uncontrollably, as if her entire world was crumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you're terrifying. You hid everything so well, even your kindness to me was all an act."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie panicked. Did Steven already know about George?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's lips curled into a faint smirk as he stared at her frightened face. "Queenie, if I didn't go out of my way to treat you well, how else would Andrew lower his guard? After all, he needed you to get what he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurting Diana while I pretended to dote on you is something I'll regret forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do you know why your plan failed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven answered his own question. "It's because Andrew never hid his kindness to you. That's how I figured out your intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I outplayed you, acting so well that you never suspected me all these years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha," Queenie sneered, her malicious expression now completely unmasked. "Steven, you'll never have Diana. You got what you wanted, but so did I. Do you even know how much she hates you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's body stiffened for a moment, his gaze darkening. "That's not something you need to worry about. Queenie, your plan with Andrew failed. You should hurry and find him&mdash;his building overseas just collapsed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie abandoned everything, not even sparing her gift a glance, and rushed out of the Gellar Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is George safe?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her retreating figure and let out a faintly mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what awaits you next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at his phone and sent a message to Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Queenie's gone to find Andrew. Keep an eye on her. Make sure to find that person before the year ends.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan: [Got it, boss.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Steven push the door open and step inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He switched his shoes at the entryway and looked up to see Diana sitting on the couch, laughing so hard at something on her phone that she was nearly falling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha," Diana burst into laughter. "Human kids are just the cutest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was watching a video of a little girl's adorable interactions with her mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she noticed Steven entering, her laughter stopped abruptly, though the smile lingering on her lips was impossible to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat beside her and smiled. "What are you watching? You're having such a good time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head, still smiling. "Nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew she didn't want to elaborate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Helen came downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the two sitting on the couch, she smiled and walked over. "Steven, Diana, let's go watch a movie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were still married, and she wanted the couple to spend some time together today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her age, she cherished every day she had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood up first and helped Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, sure! Let's go watch a movie. We'll spend the whole day with you, doing whatever you'd like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen patted her hand happily, then glanced at her precious grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a low voice, she said, "Diana, you're a smart girl. Don't just look at the surface of things. Steven is ambitious, and you two will face many challenges. But you must focus on his true feelings and not let others manipulate you. Let me tell you something&mdash;everything Steven did with Queenie was because his father was so heartless. Later, I'll share a secret with you, and you'll understand everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze slightly. She knew Helen wouldn't say such things lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, she had no desire to learn whatever secret Helen was hinting at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were far too many frightening secrets within families like theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never understood why Andrew was so determined to ruin Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tiger wouldn't harm its own cub, yet Andrew's actions were baffling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen took Diana's hand and led her forward, turning to Steven as she spoke, "Steven, bring down some snacks Diana likes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll head down first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled and nodded. "Sure, Grandma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the elevator, Helen spoke again. "Diana, I know Steven has done some awful things over the years. But you understand his past&mdash;he's had it rough. When people approach him with ulterior motives, he plays along, staying calm while waiting for his chance. He might seem heartless, but that doesn't mean he isn't kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm not asking you to forgive Steven, but he's lived such a lonely life. I just hope you'll spend more time with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana offered a faint, bitter smile. "Grandma, I understand all of that. I know his past and how hard his childhood was. Every day I've spent by his side, I've been sincere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen sighed deeply. "I see now that you truly care for him, Diana. But understand this&mdash;until Steven gains full control, he can't show kindness to anyone. Anyone he cares about ends up targeted, like his mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened sharply. She understood exactly what her grandmother-in-law meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving Steven had been her way of avoiding such a tragic fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, she had cared for Steven but had been destroyed by his own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she didn't understand was why Helen was bringing this up now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, the pain I've endured is real," Diana said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana understood what her grandmother-in-law was trying to say. In her past life, she had suffered a miserable fate because of Steven. In this life, she didn't want to wade into such murky waters again&mdash;she just wanted to live a simple, happy life.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="888.html">« Prev</a><a href="890.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
