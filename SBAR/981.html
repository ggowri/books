Because I&#x27;m the stain on your perfect love story, aren&#x27;t I?&quot;</p><p>Paula&#x27;s silence spoke volumes.</p><p>Diana felt a chill run through her as she watched Paula&#x27;s face. How had she missed this all along? The signs had been there in Paula&#x27;s behavior, but someone had carefully steered her away from the truth.</p><p>The realization hit her like ice water. There was only one question left: who had tampered with her paternity test?</p><p>She&#x27;d taken the test in secret, convinced Jeff wasn&#x27;t her real father. But she&#x27;d never imagined someone would go so far as to alter the results.</p><p>But both tests had confirmed Jeff as her biological father. Now she wondered if either had been real.</p><p>Paula was equally stunned. She stared at Diana and asked, &quot;Diana, you suspected Jeff wasn&#x27;t your father?&quot;</p><p>Diana nodded. &quot;Yes, I did. I was so unsure after the first test that I did another one. I couldn&#x27;t understand how a father could poison his own daughter. And not just once. Every chance he got, he tried to harm me.</p><p>&quot;But both tests said I was his daughter. If you didn&#x27;t meddle with them, who did?&quot;</p><p>Today, Diana hadn&#x27;t learned a secret from Jenny. Instead, she had learned a secret about herself from her biological mother.</p><p>Paula was overwhelmed with guilt. This had been her deepest secret, yet Diana had already doubted her parentage long ago.</p><p>Whether Jeff was her biological father or not, it didn&#x27;t matter. He had never cared for Diana, and he never would.</p><p>Paula&#x27;s resentment toward Jeff grew even deeper.</p><p>She thought, &quot;Soon, those people will get what they deserve.&quot;</p><p>Amelie, who had chased wealth all her life, would end up with nothing.</p><p>Diana wasn&#x27;t surprised by this outcome.</p><p>She had planned to investigate these matters later, but Steven&#x27;s situation had come up.</p><p>Now, she was sure Jeff didn&#x27;t know the truth.</p><p>Looking at Diana&#x27;s calm expression, Paula felt an ache in her chest. Once, she had dreamed of having a daughter.</p><p>She had poured all her love into Queenie.</p><p>But what happened afterward was completely unexpected.</p><p>She realized now that she hadn&#x27;t truly loved Jeff. She had just gotten used to him being there.</p><p>That night of betrayal left her feeling guilty, so she had treated Jeff and his family exceptionally well.</p><p>But in the end, she was nothing more than a joke. Jeff had only been with her for her wealth.</p><p>&quot;Diana, could it be your biological father? Maybe he&#x27;s nearby, watching over you. Could he be the one hiding the truth about your identity?&quot;</p><p>Diana blinked, surprised by the suggestion.</p><p>It was possible. If her biological father didn&#x27;t want to acknowledge her, he might have manipulated the tests to keep her from finding out.</p><p>Whoever was behind it was meticulous. Every detail had been perfectly handled.</p><p>Diana let out a bitter laugh. She had endured betrayal from family and heartbreak from love. Now, she felt numb, and knowing the truth no longer hurt.</p><p>&quot;Honestly, the truth doesn&#x27;t matter. Even if you tell me my biological father is someone else, I wouldn&#x27;t care. I&#x27;ve already lost you. Why would I care about a man who&#x27;s never met me, never raised me?</p><p>&quot;I was too greedy before. I shouldn&#x27;t have longed for your love or expected you to treat me like your daughter. After hearing the truth, I don&#x27;t blame you. I forgive you. You don&#x27;t need to keep punishing yourself.</p><p>&quot;Most people in your position would have chosen to terminate the pregnancy. They wouldn&#x27;t have let me come into this world. After all, I was just a stain on your love.&quot;</p><p>Diana smiled sincerely, &quot;Ms. Barnes, thank you for giving birth to me. Knowing this truth, I can&#x27;t hate you anymore.&quot;</p><p>And she didn&#x27;t. She was genuinely grateful Paula had brought her into the world. If not, she wouldn&#x27;t have met her grandfather or her three brothers.</p><p>Or Olivia, her best friend.</p><p>Paula wept uncontrollably.</p><p>Her daughter had forgiven her but didn&#x27;t want her anymore. It felt no different than being rejected.</p><p>As Paula cried, Diana sat there, unsure how to comfort her.</p><p>She waited for a while, but Paula continued to cry, heartbroken. Diana still had other matters to attend to.</p><p>She felt that Paula shouldn&#x27;t spend her entire life in self-blame. It was time to look forward.</p><p>She rolled her wheelchair closer and held Paula&#x27;s hand.</p><p>Paula froze and looked up, startled. &quot;Diana...&quot;</p><p>Diana smiled. &quot;Stop crying. Life moves forward. You&#x27;ve broken free from someone as awful as Jeff. Things will only get better for you. I&#x27;ve moved on already.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The damage from the past can&#x27;t be undone. Don&#x27;t try to make up for it. The wounds won&#x27;t heal. Just promise me you won&#x27;t hurt me again. We&#x27;ve caused enough pain for each other. Let&#x27;s stop here.</p><p>&quot;Ms. Barnes, from today on, I won&#x27;t hate you anymore. You can go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Diana.&quot; Paula looked at her with red, tear-streaked eyes. She didn&#x27;t want to give up. She wanted Diana to call her &quot;Mom.&quot; She wanted to pour all her love into her. No matter who Diana&#x27;s father was, she was still her daughter.</p><p>Diana didn&#x27;t reply. She wheeled herself away.</p><p>At the door, a shadow flickered past.</p><p>Diana narrowed her eyes, thinking, &quot;Where&#x27;s Luna? Why isn&#x27;t she guarding the door?&quot;</p><p>Outside, she saw a man running off. From the back, she recognized Edison.</p><p>She thought, &quot;That guy! Is he playing spy now?&quot;</p><p>Then, a thought crossed her mind, and she smiled. She turned around and looked at Paula&#x27;s tear-streaked face, saying, &quot;At least this means I have nothing to do with Queenie anymore. Being related to her was disgusting.&quot;</p><p>Paula froze again. Diana&#x27;s smile was beautiful, radiant, just like a younger Paula.</p><p>Paula realized she had completely lost her daughter.</p><p>&quot;Diana, I&#x27;ll be better from now on. As long as I&#x27;m alive, I&#x27;ll try to be a good mom. That&#x27;s my gift to you. Every year, I&#x27;ll prepare a gift for you. Whether you accept it or not, it will be there. This is my love, not compensation.&quot;</p><p>In Paula&#x27;s mind, it was never too late for a mother&#x27;s love.</p><p>She knew Diana was a soft-hearted girl.</p><p>She placed a gift on Diana&#x27;s lap and said, &quot;Diana, this is my sincerity.&quot;</p><p>Diana didn&#x27;t reach for it. She had no reason to hate Paula anymore. She realized now that it had been her own greed that made her long for motherly love.</p><p>She felt since that longing was unreasonable, she couldn&#x27;t fault Paula for her favoritism.</p><p>Diana reminded her, &quot;Someone was eavesdropping just now. Queenie and Jeff will probably know about this soon.&quot;</p><p>Paula shook her head. &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid. Thanks to you, I&#x27;ve secured all my assets. Focus on recovering. I&#x27;ll visit you in a few days.&quot;</p><p>Paula lingered, reluctant to leave, before finally turning to go.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="980.html">« Prev</a><a href="982.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
