The thought of it made her laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she schemed against Diana, there was no way Steven hadn't noticed. He had turned a blind eye because of his favoritism toward her. But now, he was the one accusing her of being cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie found him </span><span>fake</span><span> and ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept trying to call Steven, but his phone remained off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, she sent him a message:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Steven, I'm sick, and I feel terrible. I really miss you!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the message, Queenie lay down, intending to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she struggled to fall asleep all night, her mind haunted by images of Steven's cold demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected him to become so indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was lost in her thoughts, her phone lit up. She quickly grabbed it, hoping it was a reply from Steven, but instead, it was a message from Levi:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Queenie, I miss you. How about we meet tonight at my villa?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hesitated but felt a flutter of excitement at the thought of Levi's muscular build. Unable to resist, she replied to him, then took the medication on the table and headed out to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Diana woke up feeling refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body felt relaxed and light. She'd slept incredibly well, though she couldn't quite understand why she'd been so deeply asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning her head, she was relieved to see Steven wasn't there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She assumed he had left during the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stretching lazily, she muttered to herself, "I could really go for a sandwich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up her phone and called the housekeeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, you're awake. What would you like for breakfast? I'll prepare it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. "Daren, I'd love a sandwich, with plenty of lettuce, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, ma'am," Daren replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ended the call with a smile and then got out of bed to wash up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slipped into a thick, pink sweatshirt and pulled her hair up into a bun. As she looked at her fresh, lively reflection in the mirror, she paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle smile spread across her face as she admired her bright and vibrant appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I'm doing just fine without you. I don't regret leaving you one bit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I'm in great shape. After the divorce, I should really date again. I don't want to waste my beauty," she said to herself, giving her cheeks a playful pat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! I'm so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful..." she hummed to herself as she strolled out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of a man standing in the room made her jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted angrily, "Steven, why are you still here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face darkened, having heard her talking to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After the divorce, you plan to date?</span><span> </span><span>Diana, I've told you, we are not getting a divorce. You'd better give up that idea and start thinking about our future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot him a glare, clearly not in the mood to engage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She marched out of the room, completely ignoring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her walk away, Steven felt a wave of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stopped after a few steps, then turned back to ask, "Steven, where did you sleep last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pointed to the sofa. "I slept on the couch. It's quite comfortable, even better than the bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, her blanket was incredibly soft and warm, with a light, airy feel and a delicate scent that was uniquely hers. He hadn't expected that sharing the same bed with her would allow him to sleep so peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body was so soft. Holding her close made him long for her. Suddenly, he found himself wanting to possess her completely.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="598.html">« Prev</a><a href="600.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
