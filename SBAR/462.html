"Linda, after all these years, do you really see me as that kind of person?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever since I found out that Jeff deceived me, swapping my daughter for a life of luxury with his mistress and then callously abandoning my own child, I've wished he were dead. How could I possibly feel any reluctance about him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a tiger spares its young, but Jeff doesn't even protect his own blood. Those four kids have inherited his temperament and are all malicious in their own ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe they treat Queenie so well because they know the truth. After all, she is their half-sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula gazed intently at Linda, her eyes brimming with tears. "Linda, to be honest, those four boys were deliberately spoiled by Jeff. I've tried to correct them. It's not that I didn't notice the problems. It's just that Jeff is incredibly persuasive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every time I tried to emphasize the importance of education, he would stir them up, saying that a degree isn't everything and that wealth is what truly matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet he sent Queenie to a prestigious university to learn all sorts of skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at those four rascals. They can barely manage to get into college. If the Barnes family collapses, they won't even be able to find jobs, let alone get married and start families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea left Gale, and Paige left Frank, all thanks to Queenie's schemes. And now, Penelope is still dreaming of marrying into the Marsh family, hoping they'll be the easy targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie has always known that the child in Penelope's belly isn't Gale's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige is a good girl, devoted to Frank. But Queenie feared that the Sutton family might gain power and deliberately set a terrible woman to approach Frank, plotting against Paige at every turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Linda, this woman is dangerous. After investigating for over half a year, we found that half the people in the company work for her. That's why we have to let this company go bankrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those four have been raised to be useless. You suggest I groom Eric as the heir? I shared some information with him today, but he only believes his father and refuses to trust me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Linda, if they want to destroy themselves, I won't stop them. But they can't block my path either. The Barnes family is the blood, sweat, and tears of my parents and grandparents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I absolutely cannot let the Marsh family ruin what I've built over the years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had made her decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she felt heartache for the children she raised, she knew that if it came down to her life or her parents suffering, she would choose to abandon the four children to protect her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda understood her character and her sense of duty, which was why, after marrying Jeff, she took the initiative to provide him with 100 thousand each month for his parents' living expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you've already done more than enough for the Marsh family. Those two old fools don't appreciate it. They know everything but keep it hidden from you and the kids. Right now, you need someone you can trust by your side..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Linda, if we stand out too much, it might drag us into the abyss. By letting go of this company, we may lose billions, but we can still live well, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Living was the only hope. Paula's heart ached at the memory of Jeff poisoning her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="461.html">« Prev</a><a href="463.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
