The next second, his car went haywire. The steering wheel bucked in his hands as his ride barreled toward Elroy's car like some caged animal breaking loose. Elroy never saw it coming&mdash;Irving's sneak attack blindsided him completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"CRASH&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bone-crushing sound of metal meeting metal drowned out everything else. Elroy let out a string of curses before the world went dark.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana had already blazed across the finish line.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Irving watched the whole thing go down and slammed his fist against the steering wheel, eyes burning with rage. "Damn it! Still too slow. Lost again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His chest felt like it was on fire, but he didn't give a damn. All he knew was he'd been beaten. Again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana killed the engine and ripped off her seatbelt. Still wearing her helmet, she spun around and bolted back toward the wreckage. She'd heard that sickening crash and caught a glimpse in her mirror of Elroy's car getting knocked clean off the track.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sprinted toward Elroy's mangled ride as the medical crew rushed in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Black smoke poured from Elroy's wheels, choking the air with the stench of burnt rubber and twisted metal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Elroy!" Diana pounded on the car window.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy was out cold, slumped over the wheel with blood trickling down his forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana whipped around to face Irving as he crawled out of his car, her stare ice-cold. "You did that on purpose."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Irving had spotted her climbing out of that silver beast, his face darkening. "So you're the real deal here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd actually let Elroy take the lead. He'd seriously underestimated this chick. Amateur? Hell no&mdash;she was a straight-up pro.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice cracked with barely contained fury. "What do you mean 'on purpose'? This is racing&mdash;shit happens. My car went out of control and nailed Elroy's. Lady, you can't just throw around accusations without proof."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stared at that sick smile twisting his face. No wonder Elroy had warned her about Irving before the race. The guy was complete trash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Think you can win by playing dirty? How long do you think that victory's gonna last? Besides, you didn't even win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's razor-sharp words cut Irving to the bone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exploded, "I didn't do jack! My car crapped out&mdash;the clutch burned up. Get the inspection team to check it if you don't believe me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he knew that'd be a pain in the ass, and they probably wouldn't bother looking at his car anyway.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana brushed him off and waved the rescue team over to help Elroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back in the lounge, everyone had watched the crash unfold. Steven let out a huge breath seeing Diana's car safely cross the finish line, but his heart jumped into his throat when she bailed out and ran toward the wreck. Stuck in the lounge with no way onto the track, all he could do was watch from afar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon enough, paramedics hauled Elroy out and rushed him to the medical bay. Diana stayed right on their heels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After running a bunch of tests, the docs said Elroy was fine&mdash;just got his bell rung from the impact. Diana finally let herself breathe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten minutes later, Elroy's crew showed up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, how's Mr. Morrison?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's good," Diana said. "Just got knocked out cold. He'll come around soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team guys all exhaled in relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That petty bastard Irving&mdash;he just can't stand losing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly. Such a sore loser he had to ram our Mr. Morrison. What a piece of shit! If he's got any balls, he should beat us fair and square."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next time I see him, I'm not letting it slide."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite Elroy's wild, rebellious streak and his bad-boy rep, he looked out for his team. His crew would ride or die for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Diana felt better about things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven rushed over in a hurry. Seeing the worry written all over his face, Diana quickly reassured him, "Don't worry, I'm fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned. Racing was too dangerous&mdash;he'd been worried sick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, the unconscious Elroy came to. The moment he opened his eyes, he grabbed the doctor's hand and asked urgently, "Doctor, did our team win?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctor rolled his eyes. "How the hell would I know if you won? All I know is you nearly died out there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood in the doorway. "Elroy, you'd risk your life just to win?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy's head was still spinning, but hearing Diana's words, he grinned. "Ha! Diana, professional racers have to put life and death aside&mdash;we race to win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Congratulations. Our team won."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are two more races coming up. I'll help you take first place in both. Trust me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In three days, I'll give you Lightning. After that, you can take Lightning to compete in the World Racing Championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn't be participating in the World Racing Championship herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ahhhhh&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy was so excited he nearly cried. But in his euphoria, he accidentally bumped his head wound. "Ahhhh... that hurts!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team members were speechless too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Team member 1: "Jesus, ever since the missus showed up, Mr. Morrison's been acting like he's lost his damn mind."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Team member 2: "No kidding. Like he never got his rabies shot."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: "..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three days later, Diana defeated all the racing teams and secured the championship for Elroy. Elroy hugged Diana with tears in his eyes, filled with regret. "Diana, why couldn't I have met you sooner? I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish, Steven grabbed him by the collar and yanked him backward. "What the hell, Steven? You treating me like a dog? How can you grab my collar like that? How can you squeeze the back of my neck? You know what that spot is? That's a man's weak point!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's like touching a tiger's ass&mdash;you just don't do it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze was ice-cold. "Let me remind you&mdash;you're hugging my wife. Let go of her. Now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy glared at Steven with red eyes but released Diana. "Diana, how do I get the feeling you married a jealous maniac?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled but said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana was about to leave, Elroy couldn't bear it. "Diana, do you really have to go today?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought of Hubery. Hubery was in Raventia. "Yeah. I need to see someone very important to me today. I'm bringing him home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah&mdash;" Elroy was shocked. "Who is it? They're so lucky&mdash;anyone you'd personally bring home must be incredibly blessed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled but didn't answer. "Elroy, race well, but stay safe. I've got 20 more super cool sports cars. If you guys win the World Racing Championship, you can pick any car from my garage&mdash;they'll all be rewards from me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow! Diana, you're loaded!" Elroy looked at Diana excitedly. "Diana, Lightning is all I need."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his excitement, Diana smiled. "Lightning is already yours."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1166.html">« Prev</a><a href="1168.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
