Back then, I wanted to participate in a piano competition, but you trapped me at home so that I wouldn't ruin Queenie's. You can do the same thing a second time, can't you? Steven, I </span><span>really </span><span>don't want to see you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't have the energy to argue with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt more and more let down by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, </span><span>Queenie ran over, took Steven's hand, and smiled gently, "Steven, I'm looking for you.

He tilted his head and whispered in her ear, "Queenie, I will tell the reporters now that you stole the design drawings from Diana, and I can testify to that. Moreover, I will expose that you denied your pregnancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His low, cold voice made Queenie's heart instantly sink into an ice cellar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She came out to find Steven just to stir up the hype and convince Diana that the design drawings had been given to her by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana would become disillusioned with him from then on, and he would belong to her forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Queenie's surprise, he proposed to reveal what she had done, causing her triumphant smile to fade gradually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, when will you and Ms. Marsh get married?
