She was more beautiful than ever.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "Steven, I'm not playing games. Once we sign those divorce papers, we're done. If you won't sign, that's fine. In two years, I'll file for divorce myself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, be reasonable. Stop this nonsense. You're my wife. No one can take that from you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven softened his tone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Diana felt like a punchline to a bad joke.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I don't understand. If you don't love me, why cling to a marriage that's already dead and buried?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana couldn't fathom his sudden reluctance to divorce.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't blame Steven for not loving her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, she might as well be a stranger. He had no reason to show her special treatment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking this way, Diana found a strange sense of peace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The world was full of unfairness. She didn't want to dwell on every little injustice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stared intently at her. She was stunning, especially her eyes - bright and captivating. Tonight, she wore a sexy black form-fitting dress that perfectly accentuated her curves.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching her laugh and chat with Alexander, he wanted to wring the guy's neck.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're coming home with me tonight. I won't say it twice!" Steven threatened coldly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't flinch. "I'm not going anywhere with you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven narrowed his eyes. "Diana..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cut the theatrics, Steven. Why on earth would I go anywhere with you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana cut him off with a laugh, turning to leave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven wanted to stop her, but then he saw Queenie coming to find him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said nothing, just glared at Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember what I said. You're coming home tonight."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. I remember what you said before - to never come back."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at Queenie, then headed back to the main hall.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie wasn't about to let her off the hook. "Diana, you're getting divorced. Why can't you just leave Steven alone? Have some self-respect."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stopped dead in her tracks and turned to face her. "Queenie, aren't you supposed to be the clever one? Then make Steven divorce me. He's the one dragging his feet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm waiting for you to work your magic. Maybe you should try that trick of yours again. You know, like those photos you sent me. Go on, get pregnant. Then maybe Steven will finally agree to divorce me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Diana's words hung in the air, the color drained from Queenie's face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hands clenched at her sides. Steven was entirely out of her control now. She had no idea what was going on in his head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, Steven hadn't even touched her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana saw right through her. Queenie didn't love Steven; she loved his money.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie might seem gentle on the surface, but her eyes held only calculation, not love.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana left.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie rushed to explain to Steven. "Don't listen to her nonsense. Those photos were just Diana trying to set me up."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven raised an eyebrow, a wry smile playing on his lips. "Then tell me, why would she want to set you up?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="312.html">« Prev</a><a href="314.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
