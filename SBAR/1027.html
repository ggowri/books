Took me this long to realize I don&#x27;t know a damn thing about you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her gaze lingered on Diana. Over the past year, she&#x27;d started to see it—Diana was different. She wasn&#x27;t just good; she was exceptional. And she&#x27;d been keeping it under wraps all this time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Of all the people in the room, Diana was the real predator in disguise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana gave her a slow, unbothered smile. &quot;Queenie, that&#x27;s just because you think too highly of yourself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had always looked down her nose at Diana, and when she stared at people from above, she never really saw them. All she ever saw was some country girl, an outsider who didn&#x27;t belong. She never looked hard enough to see what lay beneath.</p><p style="text-align:left;">First impressions stuck. To the Marsh family, to Queenie herself, Diana was just an uncultured woman who&#x27;d never belong in their world.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie clenched her fists, her sharp nails digging into her palm. The quick sting brought her mind back into focus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had always known she was talented—design, business, leadership—but medicine? How the hell had Diana mastered that, too?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just who had been teaching her all this time?</p><p style="text-align:left;">And more importantly, who the hell was that old man?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Owen stole a glance at Diana. His usual casual indifference faded as something heavier settled in his gaze—respect. There was more to her story than he&#x27;d ever realized.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie wasn&#x27;t the same woman she used to be. Sweet? Kind? That had all been an act. Not that Owen had ever bought it—he&#x27;d always known she was a snake. But since Steven liked her, he&#x27;d kept his mouth shut.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And Diana? He used to think she was just dumb.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven didn&#x27;t care about her, and yet she still chased after him like a lost puppy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now? Now, he realized he had been the dumbest one in the room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Neither of these women was simple.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Underestimate someone, and he&#x27;d only set himself up for one hell of a nasty surprise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And the way things were going, he and Yanson were next on Queenie&#x27;s hit list.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Owen glanced down at Yanson, still sprawled out on the floor, looking every bit the fool he was. He had been played—completely and utterly used by Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The officers had let them bicker long enough. One of them finally stepped forward, voice firm. &quot;Alright, enough. You&#x27;re all coming to the station for questioning.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna lifted her chin and spoke coolly, &quot;Officer, I have evidence. Everything Mr. Farley said is true. I recorded the entire thing—this woman took her clothes off to lure him in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;When I got caught filming, I was locked in the room across the hall.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her icy gaze swept across the room, daring anyone to challenge her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She raised her phone, tapped the screen, and the video began to play.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You can&#x27;t just take her word for it. This isn&#x27;t some he-said-she-said situation. We have hard proof.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;A real victim wouldn&#x27;t act like this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The only kind of person who would expose themselves so brazenly in front of a crowd is someone who has nothing left to lose.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna&#x27;s cold stare landed on Lillian, whose face twisted in frustration.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the footage, Lillian was seen slipping into Cecil&#x27;s private lounge shortly after he entered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The door was left slightly ajar. Inside, he was on his phone, making arrangements for the night.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian reached into her purse, pulled out a small bottle, and gave herself a quick spritz.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil, still distracted by his call, only noticed something was off when the scent hit his nose. He turned around, spotting the intruder.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His brows furrowed. &quot;Who the hell are you? What are you doing here? This is my private lounge. No one but me is allowed in here.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian didn&#x27;t move. Instead, she smiled sweetly, took off her jacket, and revealed the strappy dress underneath, her fair skin glowing under the dim light. Her voice dripped with seduction. &quot;Mr. Farley, relax. I&#x27;m here for you. You smell that? Doesn&#x27;t it make you want me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She slinked forward like a snake, her hips swaying as she reached for his hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil was a man. And under the influence of that scent, no man would stand a chance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In a flash, his mind fogged over.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He shoved her back, his grip tightening. &quot;Get the hell away from me!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He tried to push her off, but Lillian clamped onto his arm like a vice. Then, in a heartbeat, her voice turned shrill. &quot;Help! Somebody help me! Mr. Farley is attacking me!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She bolted toward the door, and Cecil only followed to stop her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But to an outsider, it looked like he was chasing her down to do something far worse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The video ended.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The room fell into stunned silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They all knew people could be cruel, but this? Seeing a woman deliberately set up her trap—that was something else entirely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The older man who had defended Lillian earlier suddenly took a step back, disgusted.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my breath sticking up for her. Turns out, she&#x27;s the lowest of the low.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The lady from earlier, who had also spoken in her favor, eyed Lillian with barely concealed contempt. &quot;You&#x27;re young, yet you&#x27;ve already sunk this deep. Should I say you&#x27;re naive or just downright twisted?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian shook her head violently, her wide eyes locked on Luna. &quot;No! You conniving minx, I don&#x27;t even know you! Why are you doing this to me?!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s voice was smooth, unhurried. &quot;Because I sent her. I kept you busy with all that talking just to stall for time. I was waiting for Luna to deliver the evidence.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie and Lillian both bristled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana, however, merely arched a brow and grinned at them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The look in her eyes told Queenie all she needed to know—She lost. Again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s breath hitched, fury clawing at her chest.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A cop stepped forward and snapped handcuffs around Lillian&#x27;s wrists.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Miss, we have the evidence. You&#x27;re coming with us for questioning.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lillian&#x27;s face twisted with something dark as she turned to Cecil. &quot;Cecil, without the antidote, you&#x27;d be done for. This isn&#x27;t over.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A wicked smile spread across her face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil felt a chill crawl up his spine. Was he cursed to attract female psychopaths?</p><p style="text-align:left;">One Queenie was already enough. Now, there was another?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie could only watch as Lillian was dragged away. Before leaving, she shot one last glare at Diana and Cecil, then stormed off, limping.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil was too beaten to stand, so he had a bodyguard bring him a chair. He plopped down next to Diana and, seeing Queenie walk off, blinked in confusion. &quot;Wait... how the hell is she walking?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana glanced at him, sweat beading on his forehead. She leaned in slightly and whispered, &quot;Advanced tech.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil groaned, still in a daze. &quot;So, I got screwed over by some high-tech crap too? That Celestia Draught—gross as hell but strong. I feel like my body&#x27;s wrecked. Diana, tell me straight—can I still get married?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shot him a puzzled look, blinking. That was not the question she&#x27;d expected.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What the hell does Celestia Draught have to do with you getting married?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1026.html">« Prev</a><a href="1028.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
