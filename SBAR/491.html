His mind raced as he wondered, "What have we done to Diana? Even animals protect their young, but Jeff...he's more terrifying than a demon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only reason I didn't chase after Jeff and take a swing at him was because I didn't want to ruin Mom's plan. Jeff, Queenie, do you think you can wipe out my family? Dream on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric turned and walked away. Once he got in the car, he called Diana, but only the cold, mechanical voice responded, "The number you have dialed is currently on another call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was to apologize to Diana. He knew she'd never forgive him, but he finally understood the hurt she'd endured, all because they had coddled Queenie at her expense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several failed attempts to reach Diana, it dawned on Eric. She had already blocked them. She had cut off everyone from the Marsh family. That night he'd called her for help, and it didn't go through&mdash;only now did he realize it was because she had blocked him, forcing him to use another number to get through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha..." He let out a bitter laugh. The fool all along had been him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the memory of Diana's indifferent eyes filled Eric with a strange, creeping dread. Deep down, he knew the answer&mdash;She would never forgive any of them, not after everything they had put her through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of Queenie, the daughter of a mistress, they had insulted and humiliated their own sister. They shared the same blood, and yet, how could they have been so heartless in bullying her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because they always saw Queenie being mistreated that they favored her? No, that wasn't it. Deep down, they just looked down on Diana, the girl brought back from the countryside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that realization, Eric collapsed in the driver's seat, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Diana had already arrived at the police station. She spotted Wyatt and his wife, Courtney Campbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney, now over fifty, still maintained an impressive figure and radiated an elegant beauty. Dressed in jewels from head to toe, she exuded a commanding presence, with every gesture brimming with poise and grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blocked Diana's path and said indifferently, "Ms. Bishop, let's have a chat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Courtney's expression, full of anger, wondering, "I'm not even mad yet, so what right does she have to be angry? I'm the victim here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could guess who Courtney was but hadn't actually met Samuel's mother, so she asked, "And who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney lifted her chin high, staring at the stunning woman before her, thinking, "If it weren't for this little wretch, that old lady would've been dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the entire Farley family should belong to my husband and son. But because of one kind act from Diana, our whole plan fell apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My son only ran Diana down after hearing that she ruined our scheme."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Courtney finally spoke. "Ms. Bishop, I'm Samuel's mother. I want you to sign a statement of forgiveness to let my son off the hook. Tell me what you want, and I'll give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "My son can't have a criminal record. He'll be running the company one day. Diana's all alone&mdash;she's got no power to fight us. Her only options now are to take the money and leave or end up dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, noticing the disdain in Courtney's eyes. "Ma'am, if you don't respect me, then don't bother coming to me. If you actually want my forgiveness, maybe drop that condescending look. It's quite unpleasant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's straightforward words made Courtney's face darken in an instant. She glared at Diana. "Diana, you think you're worthy of my respect?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="490.html">« Prev</a><a href="492.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
