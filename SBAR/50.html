She sniffled, wiped her tears, and answered with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tobias," she said, her voice tinged with emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias's voice was filled with concern. "What happened? Who hurt you? Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Diana just wanted to be comforted by her brother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just feeling down," she admitted. "How did my life become such a mess? I have a heartless family and fell for a terrible man. I want to leave this place. The air feels so tainted, especially seeing Steven and Queenie together. It&rsquo;s suffocating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He&rsquo;s not worthy of being called human. They need to face the consequences of their lies. Remember when Steven was injured, and Queenie ran off with someone else abroad? I spent a fortune and a year of my life helping him heal. And how did he repay me? With betrayal and lies. Tobias, how did I let him into my life?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias asked gently, "Diana, where are you right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tears had stopped, and she managed a smile. "I just needed to vent. I'm okay now. I have you all," she said, feeling a bit of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly girl," Tobias replied warmly. "We&rsquo;re your family. No matter what happens, always tell us. Don&rsquo;t waste your tears on those people. Believe in yourself; you&rsquo;ve always been amazing. You&rsquo;ll shine for yourself and for others. Stop crying, okay? I&rsquo;ll be back tonight. Tell me what you want for dinner."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt warmth spread through her heart. She thought for a moment. "Bring me a roasted chicken, and get some shrimp for Olivia. She&rsquo;s staying with us for a while."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her calmer voice, Tobias sighed in relief. "Alright! I&rsquo;ll get whatever you want. Rest up and take care. I&rsquo;ll be home around 6 PM. Don&rsquo;t let Steven upset you; he&rsquo;s not worth it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! He&rsquo;s not worth my tears. I understand," Diana chuckled and hung up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Talking to Tobias had lifted her spirits. She used a tissue to wipe her tears and clean her sticky eyelashes. After a deep breath, she felt much more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up and headed downstairs, hoping by the time she reached the bottom, her face would show no signs of tears so Olivia wouldn&rsquo;t worry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t notice Steven standing on the staircase, stunned by what he had overheard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was true&mdash;Diana had saved him back then.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="49.html">« Prev</a><a href="51.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
