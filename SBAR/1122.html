I have no idea."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her shy reaction and found it utterly adorable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised an eyebrow, feigning nonchalance. "Do you girls talk about how sexy the guys you like are?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head, refusing to admit it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They did talk about it, but not much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t press further. He still remembered them joking about bringing their kids just to see handsome men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chuckled, pulled her to her feet, and wrapped her in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her for a moment, then took her hand and led her out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked him, "Where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Usually, after dinner, he</span><span>'</span><span>d dive straight into work, never stepping out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought about couples in love, strolling hand in hand, picking out gifts together. He wanted to experience that feeling too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you say you</span><span>'</span><span>d give me a chance? Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go on a date right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A date?" Diana exclaimed in surprise. "Where are we going for this date?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had eaten a bit too much tonight and actually felt like taking a walk, but she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to go too far.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let</span><span>'</span><span>s just take a casual walk," Steven said, his voice deep and alluring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought the villa neighborhood was dull; it had been ages since she last enjoyed the downtown buzz.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Then let</span><span>'</span><span>s drive downtown. If we</span><span>'</span><span>re going on a date, let</span><span>'</span><span>s head to the central square. There are plenty of couples there, and after 9 PM, street performers put on shows."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There</span><span>'</span><span>s an amazing food street there. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll take you to check it out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had never experienced the life of ordinary people. He was always above it all, with everything meticulously arranged by Evan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Steven focused on his work, he never had to worry about anything else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was thrilled to see her willing to go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting in the car, Steven drove straight to downtown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Capitole's main square buzzed with life at night&mdash;street musicians, live concerts, and break dance performances lit up the atmosphere. Right across the square lay a bustling food street.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To their left, a crowd of people was busy live streaming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana found it particularly fascinating. She ran over to take a closer look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood off to the side, feeling utterly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But everyone around them seemed completely unfazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap between reality and live streaming was truly striking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, however, was thoroughly intrigued. Passing by a convenience store, she bought a chocolate bar, popped it into her mouth, and grinned like a carefree teenager.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven rarely saw her this genuinely happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always known that Diana was a simple girl, easily content with the little things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was different from other girls; all she ever wanted was happiness and good health.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Steven, look over there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven followed the direction she was pointing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed the dim lights in that direction. A crowd had gathered, candles flickered on the ground, and roses were arranged in a heart shape. It looked incredibly romantic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked curiously, "Diana, what are they doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew exactly what they were doing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took his hand and said, "Come on, let me show you. Life isn't all about work&mdash;you need to experience a little romance now and then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana led Steven through the crowd, and they saw a man holding a bouquet of roses, kneeling on one knee before a girl in a white dress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked up at the girl, his eyes filled with deep affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "My love, we've known each other for seven years. On this beautiful day, I've gathered all my courage to propose. Will you marry me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girl, tears streaming down her face, closed her eyes in overwhelming emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A crowd had gathered around, watching them. She looked shy, a little unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd began chanting, "Say yes! Say yes..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girl took a deep breath, tears in her eyes, and nodded at the man before her. "I will!" she said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted into thunderous applause.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man slid a perfectly fitting ring onto her finger. They embraced tightly, holding onto each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Overjoyed by his successful proposal, the man lifted the girl and spun her around three times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd burst into enthusiastic applause, witnessing their love story unfold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought it was incredibly romantic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana tilted her head toward Steven. He looked just as surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and said, "Steven, see? Every moment, someone in this world is finding happiness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked into her eyes. In that moment, he truly understood what happiness meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana loved him deeply too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "Diana, I get it now. Thank you for always wanting me to be happy. But you forgot&mdash;my happiness only exists when you're by my side."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze was intense, almost obsessive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and gave him a playful wink.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven loved the way she winked; he found it absolutely adorable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Come on, let's go have some fun over there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her trying to avoid him, but he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t in any rush.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They headed to the food street.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had just bought a hot dog when she spotted Julius and Paige.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius was gently feeding Paige some ice cream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly pulled Steven aside to hide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had also caught sight of Julius and Paige.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked her, "Diana, why are we hiding?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana whispered, "They'll get embarrassed if they see us. They're in the middle of a romantic moment. Let's not disturb them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed the newly engaged couple had also arrived. They were buying cotton candy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boy bought a pink cotton candy and handed it to the girl. They gazed at each other, happiness written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Turns out, as long as two people are in love, they can find happiness anywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he felt truly happy, knowing he had Diana's love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius and Paige walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had finished her hot dog as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a small burp and said, "Steven, going out for a walk at night is too dangerous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced around cautiously and asked, "Diana, where's the danger?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana tossed the wrapper into the trash can and said, "There</span><span>'</span><span>s delicious food everywhere. The danger is me gaining weight!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1121.html">« Prev</a><a href="1123.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
