"That's true. By the way, Diana, take a look at the news. Ms. Barnes has changed the surnames of her four sons to Barnes. She has also released the news."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana opened her mobile phone. Capitole News Network automatically pushed news.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw the news released by Paula. It clearly described how Jeff had cheated on Paula and abandoned Paula after she owed debts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula also posted a recording of Tracey scolding her four sons as losers and claiming to sever ties with her four grandsons on the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Diana did not feel happy but sad. They were a family. But they were scheming against each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna, however, was happy. "Diana, it's a good thing that your surname has always been Bishop. Otherwise, you would have to have the surname Barnes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, Diana felt quite confused. "Yes! Grandpa asked me to go back at that time, but he said that my surname was Bishop and that I could only have the surname Bishop."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "At that time, my grandfather was insistent and said that my surname could not be Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I did not change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lived my life again. But I still don't know why my grandfather was so persistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he knew long ago that the Marsh family is particularly shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana closed her eyes. Arriving downstairs at the company, she did not go upstairs to find Nolan but asked him to come downstairs and talk in the car. It was too cold outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan came down with two baked sweet potatoes in his hand and gave them to Diana and Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the sweet potato that Nolan handed over. The sweet flavor made her drool.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, the baked sweet potatoes sold by that lady are really delicious, soft and sticky."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Nolan and smiled brightly, "Nolan, you understand women's hearts the best. Baked sweet potatoes in winter are the warmest."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took it and took a bite. It was really sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna also liked to eat it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan showed the design to Diana, who ate while reading it. Then, Diana was amazed. "Nolan, your study abroad was not in vain. This design is perfect. However, the hot spring is in this place. We need to build a road to get there. Each road must connect to each hot spring pool, and the privacy near it must be planned well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The toilets should be moved to the back. Cherries and peaches should be planted on the land behind them. Cherries can be picked in the summer, and peaches can be picked in the fall. It can also attract some customers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This location is not very good. There is a slope in this area. Move it back a little and build the wall here. It is more than 32 feet away from the hotel. This 32 square feet area can be used to plant landscape trees. It will keep the customers safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan wrote them down one by one. Diana returned the design to him and said, "Nolan, the design is out now. After the Christmas, we will find someone to conduct an on-site survey and do a technical appraisal. Then, we can slowly develop it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana was approving, Nolan smiled proudly, "Okay, Diana. Leave the rest to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was relieved. "Okay! Go to your work."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was happy after getting one thing done.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan left happily. Diana ate the baked sweet potatoes before asking Luna to take her back to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was now mainly responsible for clothing design and had to do her job diligently and responsibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana now received steady dividends from Alexander, and Steven's sales were also excellent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Look. After getting rid of the love-oriented brain, I'm flying."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="681.html">« Prev</a><a href="683.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
