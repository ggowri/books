I&#x27;m just messing with you. I&#x27;ve done a paternity test; I really am his daughter.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a satisfied smile, she headed back to her room. Things were going just as planned. She&#x27;d managed to stir up some chaos among the three of them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In this life, she played it smart. There were things she didn&#x27;t need to do herself. Others would step in to help her. She could sit back and watch the drama unfold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff was a real piece of work, but she was no match for Paula.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was a seasoned pro in the business world, while Jeff had been hiding behind her for years.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, he was afraid to make any waves with Mark, but who knew what the future held?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven watched her, amusement flickering in his eyes. &quot;Your strategy&#x27;s pretty clever. Letting them turn on each other.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana raised an eyebrow, a mock-serious look on her face. &quot;Just remember, don&#x27;t get in my way. I&#x27;ve got my score to settle.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even though she couldn&#x27;t shake him completely, she wasn&#x27;t scared of Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He smirked, his gaze playful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I won&#x27;t butt in on your plans. Just promise me you won&#x27;t fight me on this. Cook for me, hang out with me, and do your thing. I&#x27;ll back you up with whatever you need.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once, he&#x27;d been fooled by Queenie&#x27;s charm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, he wanted to shower Diana with all the affection he&#x27;d held back before.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No matter what she wanted, he&#x27;d be there for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yet, he sensed she was pushing him away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana noticed his change, and it both intrigued and unnerved her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I said I don&#x27;t want your help. Just let me be, okay?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, you need to remember. Stay out of my life. I don&#x27;t want you in it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her tone was firm, leaving no room for argument.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven felt a pang of something deep inside him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Their roles had switched. It used to be Diana who tiptoed around him, but now it felt like he was the one being careful, while she wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He stayed silent, his lips pressed together as he sat on the sofa, lost in thought.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana, meanwhile, chose to ignore him, finding him too stubborn for her liking.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She opened a cake sitting on the table, grabbed a spoon, and took a bite. Her eyes lit up as she savored the sweetness, her mood instantly lifting.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;This is amazing! So sweet!&quot; she said, her face brightening as she dug in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven watched her, surprised at how simple pleasures made her so happy. Just a little cake could transform her entire demeanor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He remembered the days when she would smile just watching him enjoy her cooking.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But those days felt like a lifetime ago.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before long, Diana finished off the whole cake, patting her contented belly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Life like this was pretty sweet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the middle of winter, it was a perfect time to gain a little weight, and she didn&#x27;t mind one bit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She stretched, feeling a yawn coming on, and glanced at Steven, wondering why he hadn&#x27;t left yet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, her phone buzzed with a new message. It was from Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Diana, check it out! Look at this sexy nightgown Steven bought me. Isn&#x27;t it gorgeous? He says he&#x27;ll love seeing me in it. You won&#x27;t believe how wild he goes when I wear something like this. He can keep me in bed all day!]</p><div class="pagination"><a href="798.html">« Prev</a><a href="800.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
