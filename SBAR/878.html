His cold smile held none of the sympathy he once felt for her fake tears and forced innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to help you," he said, his voice as frigid as his expression, "because I thought you were kind. Even when you played your little tricks, I saw no harm in them and let it go. But tell me, Queenie, what have you actually done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you absolutely sure it was you who saved me back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt her mind explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Has he discovered something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible. All the evidence has been destroyed long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes darted nervously toward her father. She forced herself to smile. "Steven, of course, it was me. My father was there too, remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at Jeff, his smirk laced with an ominous edge. "Mr. Marsh, the fire that year was man-made, and so was my car accident; how coincidental that you two were on the scene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact," he continued, "I've recently tracked down the owner of that lodge. I'll be paying them a visit to find out the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff and Queenie's eyes widened in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face contorted, caught somewhere between indignation and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Why is Steven suddenly revisiting those incidents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven," Jeff stammered, "we would never harm you. My biggest wish has always been for you and Queenie to end up together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you forgotten? When you were in the most pain, it was Queenie who accompanied you, it was Queenie who risked her life to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, those years, I gave her all my goodness, but how did you treat me?" Without waiting for an answer, he left the room, his chilling words lingering in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie watched him walk away, her nails digging into her palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See what I mean?" Jeff said coldly. "I warned you not to humiliate yourself, but you just wouldn't listen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clenched her fists. She'd ruined everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known it would turn out this way, she would never have schemed against Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Paula hadn't been her pawn against Diana, she could have stayed the cherished princess of her family and of Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Steven had changed. He didn't love her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the truth, yet she couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's icy tone cut into her spiraling thoughts. "What a joke. You can't even hold on to a man, and you're blaming everyone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze, stunned by his harshness. "Dad, I'm your daughter! How can you say that to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daughter?" Jeff sneered. "Would a daughter scheme against her own father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and walked away without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes burned red as she stood there alone. For a long time, she didn't move. She felt that everyone had betrayed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father, her mother, her brother, and the man she once wanted to marry all betrayed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she whispered to herself, "Fine. You've all betrayed me. If that's how it is, none of you deserve to be happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that if she couldn't be happy, then no one could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought, "Steven could dream of repairing his relationship with Diana. I will make sure it never happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will make sure he can't get Diana back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana may seem perfect, willing to sacrifice her life for Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman like that will make any man's life complete."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I couldn't have happiness, why should they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One by one, I will eliminate everyone standing in my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven caught up to Diana and her group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just finished settling Luna and Evan in a different room for their IV drips when she noticed him following her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, why are you here again? Shouldn't you be with Queenie? What are you doing here? Leave. You're not welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was calm, void of emotion, yet firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's schemes seemed endless. No matter where they went, she always found a way to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about the close call that nearly cost Luna and the others their lives. She wouldn't give Queenie another chance to hurt the people she cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie deserved someone like Zion to deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stayed silent, his gaze steady on Diana. Then he entered the room and sat down, looking at Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sighed, feeling exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan, seeing Steven's persistence, couldn't decide whether to feel pity or disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Queenie's dangerous nature, Evan hesitated before finally speaking. "Mr. Gellar, I'm fine here. You should go back and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave him a frosty glance. "Stay quiet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His low voice carried a faint note of frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan fell silent, unsure how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked in, instructing the nurse to set up the IVs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she sat to the side, scrolling through her phone, completely ignoring Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his eyes never left her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She checked the trending topics online. News about Queenie had disappeared, but her heroic rescue was still on the rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comments were overwhelmingly positive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[A beautiful and kind doctor. Am I the only one who finds her stunning?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[She's gorgeous. Everyone can see that!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[A doctor delivering a baby on the street is amazing! Everyone, let's boost this story!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[She's a lifesaver and a beauty. We need more people to know about her!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reading the comments, Diana couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected to save Sam and his family. Now, she had plenty of opportunities to collaborate with him in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna noticed her smile. "What's so funny, Diana? Share it with us. Being stuck here is boring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her and grinned. "Just reading people online calling me beautiful and kind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna rolled her eyes, feigning exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, why don't you use this newfound fame to promote the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No need. The hospital is for saving lives, not marketing. We don't rely on hype but on skill. Every doctor here is highly skilled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna thought about it and nodded. Diana's hospital, with Tom as its cornerstone, had always been popular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom's surgeries were booked six months in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to their conversation, Steven realized something. He learned that Diana's connection to this hospital ran deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a skilled doctor capable of performing advanced surgeries. And Tom, the renowned surgeon, was clearly an old acquaintance of hers. He finally understood just how little he knew about his own wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "She is remarkable, but when others mocked her as a "country girl," why hasn't she spoken up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you hide your abilities?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to him, her smile faint. "I never hide anything. You just never cared to look. Your eyes were always elsewhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In your world, I was just a country girl, someone you instinctively looked down on. Even if I told you I was a doctor, would you have believed me? Would you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="877.html">« Prev</a><a href="879.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
