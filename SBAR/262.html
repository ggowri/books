I'm your son," he protested. His face was a canvas of gloom as he sank into the sofa beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula, visibly drained, turned to face him. "And how do you expect me to treat you, Frank? The most selfless and the greatest love in this world is the love parents have for their children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How much do you truly understand about parental love? I've told you the girl you're so fond of has ulterior motives, yet you and Gale both put her on a pedestal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If she truly cared for you and our family, would she keep you dangling and make you chase after her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I suggested you marry Paige, but you thought her spoiled and rude. However, she's kind-hearted and diligent in her studies. She's now running her family's company, and it's flourishing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what about you? You've achieved nothing, just coasting through life, indulging in pleasures, eating, drinking, and making merry, all the while chasing after the woman you claim to love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that you've won back the woman you love and I've consented to your union, what more could you possibly want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula felt helpless. She had only recently become aware of their poor habits, but it was too late to correct them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Change, if it were to come, would have to be of their own volition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without Diana's intervention, she might have simply drifted through life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank knew he was in the wrong, but he couldn't muster any feelings for Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had known her since they were children. Despite her quirks, he was drawn to gentler women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Paige had been good to him. Spoiled and temperamental, she was nonetheless sincere in her affection for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I just like Elsie," he retorted, remaining resolute. "You have to be there for our wedding, Mom. Otherwise, Elsie will be humiliated in our social circles."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula fixed Frank with a piercing look. She was well aware he had returned, but the joy was absent from her heart. It was Queenie who orchestrated his return for her own reasons. With the matter of Gale settled, it was now time to deal with Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula said, "I owe Paige an apology. She cares deeply for you, yet you let Elsie hurt her. Frankly, you're no better than those other scoundrels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Leave me be. I've got enough on my plate with the company's affairs. Don't add to my burdens."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt drained, and her energy was leeched away by the unseen hands that toyed with her company, compounded by the recent blow of losing a crucial partnership.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's company, a titan in the realm of fashion design, dominated the market with each new release, leaving her company to scrape by in the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, after I'm married, I'll come back to the company to assist you," Frank replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was aware of the toll running the company alone had taken on his mother. He had been neglectful, spending the past year chasing after his love interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reminded of the trending topics she had seen online, Paula erupted in anger. "Get out! You're a beast, slandering your own sister. You're only fit to be with a woman like Elsie. Leave, now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was taken aback, unable to believe those words had come from his mother. "Mom, it's Diana's fault. Besides, she's cruel, always clinging to Steven. She knows Queenie and Steven are in love, yet she drags her feet, refusing to divorce him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't acknowledge such a vicious woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula smiled sadly. "Don't worry. She may not recognize you as her brother. You are not the son of the Marsh family now. I will hold a press conference tomorrow to inform everyone that you are no longer a part of the Marsh family either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you're willing to forsake this family for the sake of your so-called true love, I will suspend all your credit cards and reclaim your shares in the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's see how long your love can survive without money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing up, Paula extended her hand, coldly demanding, "Hand it over."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="261.html">« Prev</a><a href="263.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
