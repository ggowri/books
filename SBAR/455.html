"Alexander, the Marsh family is nothing but treachery. Those four sons were purposely raised to be useless by Jeff. If you want to know why, you might need to wait a bit longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to know. Diana, just stay away from them. If anything happens, call me immediately," Alexander said firmly. He had no doubt about Eric's lack of integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing!" Diana replied cheerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked away, Eric watched her with a furious glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, do you really think you can come between me and Queenie? You're the one who caused all the trouble with my brothers, and now you have the nerve to pin this on her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger was directed at himself for not being able to teach Diana a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, he got up, taking a deep breath to ease his pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his phone buzzed. It was Queenie. He felt a twinge of disappointment because he hadn't been able to get the land for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Queenie, I'm really sorry. I couldn't get that land for you," he said, his voice heavy with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all good, Eric," Queenie said, her voice upbeat. "I'll be back in three days. Can you introduce me to Mr. Morrison? He has another piece of land that might actually be worth more than the one Diana wants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, if Diana wants that land, let her have it. Ever since she came back, she's taken everything from me, even the guy I like. I can't compete, so I guess I'll just have to compromise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, I've noticed something different about Diana since she left. I'm really worried she might do something for money that could embarrass Steven. We might not care about our reputation, but I don't want her to mess up her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you see her next, please talk some sense into her. Even after the divorce, she needs to take care of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You probably already know this, but she's met a bunch of guys since she left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's voice carried a hint of hurt, but she seemed to be genuinely concerned for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that the more she said, the more Eric would grow to resent Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her voice filled with frustration made Eric's heart ache. He saw Queenie as gentle and kind, unlike Diana, who seemed ruthless and competitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, when you get back, I'll introduce you to Mr. Morrison. If Diana dares to embarrass our family, I'll deal with her myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a pause before Queenie hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her hotel room, she was fuming, tossing her phone onto the bed. Her eyes burned with frustration as she glared at Mario.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That useless thing is even more pathetic than his two brothers! He couldn't get the land back, so now we have to settle for another piece. It's next door, but I hope it's just as valuable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crossing her arms, she sat back on the couch, her demeanor icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't figure out why Diana had suddenly decided to buy land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd known for a while that she was losing control over her, but she never expected Diana to get into real estate, especially with fifty million to spend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A troubling thought crossed her mind. "Where did Diana get that money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Nolan give it to her? Or maybe it was Alexander? Or could it be Cecil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Mario, a disturbing idea forming in her mind. Narrowing her eyes, she exuded an air of danger. "Mario, do you think we've all been played by Diana? She looks rich now, but maybe she's been deceiving us all along."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="454.html">« Prev</a><a href="456.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
