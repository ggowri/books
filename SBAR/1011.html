But with the evidence right in front of him, there was no way he could let Paula know the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the reason he planned the following series of events. At the beginning, Diana was completely under their control. She didn't make any noise or resistance and allowed them to bully her. They were just waiting to drive her away at Queenie's birthday party. The next would be his four sons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since everything was under control, he felt that he could handle it and didn't care about the life or death of his four sons at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also didn't want to be called a gigolo anymore. He needed to be his own master and take control of Paula's tens of billions of dollars in assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everything changed then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana became unruly and even started to fight back. It was more than he could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff asked, "Diana, what is your relationship with Edward? Why did he specifically ask you to marry Steven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally figured out the whole thing. It seemed like everything started because of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were fixed on her stunning visage, and confusion was written all over his face. He had indeed thought about it before, yet he just couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a lot of things happened afterward, so he didn't continue with the investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana also had no idea what exactly had happened in the meantime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head and said, "I don't know. I got acquainted with Edward only after I returned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't lie about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff became even more confused. What secrets that he didn't know were hidden in it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he was fooled by Edward?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought the same as him. What exactly was it that she couldn't know about this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, when her biological mother revealed her identity, she suspected that there must be some unknown secrets behind this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning that the DNA test had been swapped twice, she started biding her time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another question came to her mind. She asked, "Mr. Jeff Marsh, I suspected before that you might not be my biological father. I did DNA tests two times, and you were the one who changed the results of those two tests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after she asked the question did she realize that she had asked a really silly one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he did change the results, then he would already know she wasn't his biological daughter. Given his character, he would have used this matter to threaten Paula long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then his subsequent plans would not have failed either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the next moment, Jeff said in a cold voice, "Diana, do you really think you would succeed if I had known from the beginning that you were not my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a few low laughs. "Hehe..." She raised her eyes, and there was not a trace of emotion in her cold eyes. She said, "That's true. I also think the question I asked just now was really stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already know everything I need to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, you'll have to make amends for what you have done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." At this moment, he finally realized that he had lost completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula and Diana had both been waiting for this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overcome with extreme anger and intense emotions, he rolled his eyes and suddenly fainted. Then he fell softly on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how heartless Amelia was, she still had some feelings for him. After all, they were lovers who grew up together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him faint, she quickly crawled to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked him up and gently patted his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried, "Jeff, wake up! You'll be all right! What Queenie wants is simply a home. As long as we love each other, Queenie won't abandon us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, pull yourself together. Queenie lost everything because of this obsession."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he showed no reaction at all. His eyes were tightly shut and there was even some white foam coming out of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was frightened. She shouted, "Jeff, you can't leave me like this. You just can't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie bet her life on us, wagered everything on us, yet we let her lose. Jeff, her life has been hard enough, we can't make it harder for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally realized the consequences of greed were ending up with nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greed was part of human nature. She wanted too much, which led to her current state of having nothing at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at them and finally called 911 out of kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't feel particularly pleased about the situation today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't want to encounter such an awful person in her life if possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were several flowers whose names she didn't know at the windowsill in Jeff's office. They were blooming beautifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magnificent flowers were clustered together, blooming so vividly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, trying to suppress the restlessness welling up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Cecil behind her and said, "Cecil, the show is over. Time to go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was still in shock over the fact that Diana was not the biological daughter of Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relationship between their family was really chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she came to her senses and looked at Amelie, who was weeping copiously, she just thought that they deserved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Endless greed and desire would ultimately lead to this last bit of struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of boundless malice, the final outcome was complete emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil pushed Diana away from this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula watched Diana leave with tears in her eyes. Apart from feeling sad, it seemed that even attempts at making amends were superfluous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't need any form of compensation from her. All she wanted was for her to stay far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they got in the car, Cecil couldn't help asking, "Diana, who's your father then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at her surprised expression and smiled, "Are you surprised? I was even more astonished than you when I learned the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil admitted frankly, "Diana, I'm really shocked. How could this be possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Isn't it a good thing that I'm not Jeff's biological daughter? I've wished countless days and nights that he wasn't my father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could there be a father as vicious as he is? Maybe God heard my wish and took pity on me. That Jeff is really not my biological father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no idea how happy I am to know that I have no blood ties with Queenie. I even woke up laughing in my dreams."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil felt deeply sorry for her. She couldn't change her origin, but she could change her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with a smile, "Diana, you are absolutely right. You cannot change your origin, but you can change your destiny with your own strength. Look at you now, you are already the apple of God's eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled radiantly, her eyes glistering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling brightly, her eyes and teeth shining, Diana said, "Come on. It's time for dinner. I'll treat you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1010.html">« Prev</a><a href="1012.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
