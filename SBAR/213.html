"Stop pretending. The photos you took are identical to the new products released by the Gellar Group," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pulled up the Gellar Group's latest products again and showed them to Gale. "Look at what you've done. You tore up my designs. Even though I know they stole my drafts, there's nothing I can do now but watch them make money from my work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already cut ties with your family, yet you keep setting me up again and again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even stealing my designs... How dare you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Silent tears streamed down Diana's face; she felt truly heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could Diana have been born into such a family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being reborn, why did she still have to come from that woman's womb?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her cry made Gale uncomfortable as well. "Diana, no matter what you say, I didn't do it," he insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna shouted angrily, "There's video evidence here. How can you still say you didn't do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Bishop, let's call the police," Luna suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded. "Alright!" she agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you can't set me up like this. I'm about to compete, and I must win this time. And I already told you, I didn't do it," Gale protested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then explain to me who you sent those photos to," Diana demanded, pointing at the video of him taking the photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale knew Diana wouldn't believe him no matter how he explained. "Diana, I told you, I didn't do it. I took the photos, but I didn't send them to anyone. I don't even know who deleted them from my phone," he insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up. Do you think I'd believe a word you say? You're born wicked, just like your vile father," Diana sneered. "Just wait. He'll personally send you to hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With only a few days to go, Diana could wait. Gale, born rotten and shameless, wouldn't meet a good end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of his father, Gale's anger flared. "Diana, was it you who set up my father last night?" he accused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have any proof?" Diana asked. "If I'd framed your father, would I still be standing here? Your family would've thrown me in jail by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Has Queenie's nonsense completely filled your brain? You believe everything she says?" Diana mocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you..." Gale started.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna interrupted, "Ms. Bishop, should we call the police?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was nervous; he couldn't afford to be arrested now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stopped Luna from making the call. She sneered, "No need. There's no need to call the police. The wicked will meet their match. Harry will find a way to get revenge as long as he's out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A man like him, who twists the truth, should be left to be dealt with by someone like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale bit his lip. "That incident was your fault..." he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your people did it. I'm the victim here, and you blame me? Gale, you're always this shameless?" Diana snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna, fuming, asked, "Ms. Bishop, are we just going to let this go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a deep breath, wiped her tears, and looked at Gale with a strange smile. "Of course, we're not letting this slide. Let him compete first, then hand the evidence to the police afterward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale quickly tried to explain, "Diana, don't frame me. I really didn't give your designs to anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't even look at him, walking away with Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was furious, hands on his hips, watching Diana leave. He felt conflicted. Was Diana really scheming against him now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But strangely, who deleted the design photos he took?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="212.html">« Prev</a><a href="214.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
