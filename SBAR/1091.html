Don</span><span>'</span><span>t push your luck. Stay away from me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She finished speaking and put some distance between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t hate him anymore, but she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t ready to make up with him so soon either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had hated Steven for so long, suffering alone all that time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted him to go through the same pain she had endured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, Diana regretted it. She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t bear to see the man she loved suffer with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So much time had passed, and the truth had reignited her love for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought love was something she just couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The misunderstanding between them was resolved. She thought of that melancholic boy from the summer years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That summer, when their eyes met, it felt like time had stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boy's deep eyes seemed to hold stories, secrets he could never tell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had touched Diana's heart just like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was later that she risked everything to save him from that fire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she woke up in the hospital, Leopold was by her side, but her mind was on Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had hopelessly fallen in love with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That summer, her love was vivid and burning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her, lost in thought, and gently asked, "Diana, what</span><span>'</span><span>s on your mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m thinking about you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven froze for a moment, a look of surprise crossing his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said she was thinking about him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stopped his hand mid-reach and said, "Relax. I was just thinking about the day we met. If I hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t met you back then, maybe things wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t be like this now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled. "Diana, do you believe this is God</span><span>'</span><span>s plan? No matter how much you run, no matter how hard you fight, we were always meant to meet in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at him and fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long pause, she replied softly, "Maybe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven moved closer to Diana, catching the faint, delicate scent on her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let them become mere passersby in each other</span><span>'</span><span>s lives. He was determined to be with her forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Diana, give me a chance. You used to chase me, now it</span><span>'</span><span>s my turn to chase you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana huffed, "No. I was too young, too naive back then. I did love you, deeply, but that was in the past."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana held back from speaking too harshly, afraid she might regret it later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven just looked at her quietly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly pointed to the glass of wine nearby and said, "Steven, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve had whiskey, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve had beer, but I can</span><span>'</span><span>t stop missing you. Do you know what that feels like?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took her hand. After drinking, her hand felt even softer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, I won</span><span>'</span><span>t leave you again. You</span><span>'</span><span>ve loved me in two lifetimes, so why can</span><span>'</span><span>t you give me one more chance now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "But my heart is already dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said gently, "Diana, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll make you fall in love with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s gentle demeanor was undeniably captivating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears clung to Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s lashes, making her look heartbreakingly vulnerable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Steven, I told you, my heart is dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her hand tightly, his fingers softly tracing her palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It tickled, and Diana felt a little shy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven. To him, her lips were like tempting roses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She did look incredibly alluring right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly leaned down and kissed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a sound of protest, but Steven was hooked. One hand cradled the back of her head as he kissed her fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After what felt like forever, Steven reluctantly let her go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gasped for air, glaring at him angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smirked and asked, "Diana, tired?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought he might kiss her again, and to her surprise, she even found herself hoping for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed a little unwilling to let it end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly asked her, "Diana, do you like this feeling a lot?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instinctively licked his lips, poured more wine with a sly smile, and handed her a glass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, have another drink. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go to bed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A lot had happened today, and he was tired too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took the glass and downed the wine in one gulp.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This wine is really good." The weather was still cold, and the wine</span><span>'</span><span>s cool temperature made it taste even better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing the wine, Diana felt dizzy, her strength slipping away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her skin flushed a soft red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Steven, is this wine really strong? Why do I feel so dizzy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana handed the glass back to him. She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t drink anymore. She was drunk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shook her head hard, but it only made her feel dizzier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven set the glass on the nearby table and helped her lie down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was drunk and feeling a bit uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She grabbed Steven's hand, looking at his handsome face, and said, "Steven, I really loved you. But why did you have to hurt me like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slowly closed her eyes, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe Diana was truly drunk. Today, they had cleared everything up. The deep love in her heart surged like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to yell at Steven, to tear into him, but she just couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t stop herself from saying she loved him, and it made her feel so pathetic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But during those years taking care of Steven, Diana had done things far more humiliating than this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, curled up on the bed, looked both pitiful and irresistibly alluring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help himself. He scooped her up and held her close against his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked down at her. The air between them grew even more romantic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, I know you're hurting. But from now on, I won't let you cry again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently wiped the tears from her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s feelings of grievance and emotion swelled, and she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t hold back anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was clearly drunk, too weak to stand, yet she still wanted to curse someone out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Steven, you jerk."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven listened to her soft voice, and it made his heart ache.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even use a harsh tone to insult him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He whispered in her ear, "Diana, I am a jerk. You can say whatever you want to me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1090.html">« Prev</a><a href="1092.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
