"Diana, I know that feeling. I feel it now. Even if I have to give up everything, I want to be with you. I understand how you felt back then. I was too much of a coward to respond to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze for a moment. Steven had been so warm these past few days, but could they really be together again?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought she was over him, but when Steven said those words, her heart still fluttered. Diana realized how complicated the human heart could be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him. "I told you, leave the rest to fate. When the day comes that I can face you with a clear heart, and you can accept me just as openly, when we</span><span>'</span><span>re both sure of each other</span><span>'</span><span>s feelings, then we</span><span>'</span><span>ll be together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But right now, I haven</span><span>'</span><span>t let go of the past. Time will heal those wounds, or maybe someone special will come along to help me forget that pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, I</span><span>'</span><span>m giving you a chance. Otherwise, do you really think you</span><span>'</span><span>d be walking here holding my hand?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was perfectly aware of what she was doing. No matter what, she was happy right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled, his sense of possession for her growing stronger. She was warm, and he knew he would never let her go again. He would become the most special person in her life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, let</span><span>'</span><span>s go over there," Steven said, pointing to the woods not far away. The white sand, green forest, and deep blue sea were truly breathtaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are crab holes! There must be crabs there," Diana said, running ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Steven received a message from Evan, informing him that Queenie had gone to see George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sent Evan a few photos and replied, "You should go see him too. Let him see how in love Diana and I are."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan replied, "Mr. Gellar, you've finally learned how to be jealous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly looked ahead at Diana. She was crouching on the ground, digging a hole, searching for crabs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were snow crabs here. He had been here two years ago and saw several large ones. The snow crabs here tasted pretty good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, let me help you." Steven walked over, his tall frame crouching beside her, radiating an intense sense of pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was always warm. Diana could feel the heat radiating from his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You</span><span>'</span><span>d have to dig really deep to find crabs. I</span><span>'</span><span>m just digging for fun. We</span><span>'</span><span>ve got plenty of seafood at home, so you don</span><span>'</span><span>t need to bother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat on a pile of firewood nearby, gazing at the beautiful sea in the distance. She felt great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat down beside her, one arm wrapped around her waist. He leaned in close and whispered in her ear, "Diana, do you like it here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was too close, his warm breath making her cheeks flush.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pulled back slightly. "Yes, I like it," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, her phone rang. She took it out and saw it was Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw it was Alexander. His face darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana answered the call with a smile. "Alexander, you're back from your trip?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's business was mostly overseas, so he was almost always traveling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander spoke gently, "Sorry, Diana, I'm only calling you today. I couldn't come back earlier while I was abroad. Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the distant sea and smiled. "I'm fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, can we have dinner together tonight?" Alexander asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and declined, "Alexander, Steven and I have plans. We'll be out for a while. Let's have dinner next time. I'll call you when I'm back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's unease vanished instantly. He held her tighter. She told the truth, and he couldn't be happier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a brief silence, Alexander said, "Diana, you chose him in the end, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice suddenly deepened, laced with a hint of anger. It felt unfamiliar to Diana, like a suppressed emotion finally breaking free. It sent a shiver of fear through her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a bit confused about why she was feeling this way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, I never divorced him," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she was with Alexander, she had made it clear they would just be friends. She only sought his help and never gave him any chance to pursue her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana understood what it felt like to love someone and not have them love you back. But there was something off about Alexander's voice. It felt... strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's voice remained low. "Diana, I understand. I'll wait for you to get divorced."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt puzzled. "Why would he wait for me to get divorced?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said irritably, "He's trying to pursue you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana put her phone away and said, "Don't be jealous. Since I said I'd give you a chance, I won't get tangled up with other men. Even if he was once a blind date my grandfather introduced, I won't get too involved with him. At most, it's just business between us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Until things are completely over between us, I won't give him any hope. It's out of respect for him and responsibility to myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't expect you to lie to me. I thought the divorce papers would be real. I never imagined you'd interfere with the courthouse."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought he was impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought for a moment and explained, "I knew Queenie would be eager to have George replace me and finalize the divorce with you. Luckily, I have a friend working at the courthouse, so I asked them for a little help."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our marriage is real, which is why all my assets could be smoothly transferred to your name."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The staff gave George and you a fake divorce certificate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The assets were too massive to risk any mistakes. I spent an entire night making all the arrangements, pulling every string I could, and using almost all my connections to get everything in place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I knew Charlie was about to make his move. By then, I also found out he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t my real father&mdash;just a fraud."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stayed silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "So, he could control everything. He always could. The real villain is Steven. He had the power to fix it all, so why did he let me suffer so much?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was furious. She shot him a sharp glare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven caught on to what Diana was thinking. Just as he was about to explain, Diana suddenly stood up, pointing at the ocean in surprise. "What</span><span>'</span><span>s that? Isn</span><span>'</span><span>t that a bluefin tuna? I can</span><span>'</span><span>t believe there</span><span>'</span><span>s a bluefin tuna here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This sea is completely unpolluted. The sashimi must taste amazing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven with excitement. "Steven, do you have any diving gear here? The weather looks great the day after tomorrow. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll catch a bluefin tuna for you to try!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1103.html">« Prev</a><a href="1105.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
