Joseph was also very nervous after seeing the news and immediately rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that he had already been admitted to the laboratory. The professor she introduced to him admired his prominence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joseph, you are in the critical stage of research and development now. You don't need to deal with such a trivial thing in the future. Just focus on your study," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her haggard face, Joseph smiled faintly with distress, "Diana, everything about you is important. They framed you. As long as I am here, I won't allow that."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph made no attempt to hide his fierce expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and thought, "He truly knows how to repay kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surrounded by several handsome men, her smile bright and enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly saw Steven and thought, "Why is he here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at the three men in front of him and realized that she did not need his help.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had transferred herself into a totally different person. She no longer needed his help.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of what Queenie said, that she was already carrying Steven's child, her face suddenly darkened. "Steven, at nine o'clock tomorrow morning, I'll be waiting for you at the courthouse."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, his eyes flashing with anger as she brought up the divorce again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not acting on a whim. The anger in her eyes proved that she was truly determined to get a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Cecil said with a smile, "Mr. Gellar, don't forget to go for the divorce with Diana at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't deserve Diana's love.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven warned him with a look, "Mr. Farley, my family matters are none of your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, every time you help others frame Diana, and yet you still say she's your family? To you, Diana is worth less than a stranger; I really don't know what you're holding onto. Every time you help Queenie frame Diana, and yet you refuse to divorce her. I've never seen such a bastard like you; you're a disgrace to all men."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could, he would beat up Steven, because he had seen how Steven protected Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about it made him mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's brows furrowed even tighter. "What do you mean by that? How have I been helping others frame Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil sneered and said with a tone mocking, "If it weren't for your acquiescence, would Queenie dare to slander Diana? And if it weren't for your arrangements, would those haters insult Diana on the Internet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven finally understood what Cecil meant. He suddenly turned to look at Diana, his voice slightly hoarse, and said, "Diana, do you think so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't know if Steven was involved in this matter, but whatever Queenie wanted to do, Steven would go all out to satisfy her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie was pregnant, and he should take responsibility for her. After all, the child was innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, her child had already started moving in the womb, a feeling that always filled her with happiness whenever she recalled it. But in the end, just like her, an incapable mother, the baby ended up as a mangled mess. Every time she thought about it, the pain was heart-wrenching.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what I think, isn't divorce what you've always wanted?" Diana felt helpless, not understanding why her choices were always wrong in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly pulled her hand to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph quickly blocked him and coldly warned Steven, "Don't touch her."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="694.html">« Prev</a><a href="696.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
