Diana, on the other hand, was calm&mdash;unshakably so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula and Gale hadn't even played their hand yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had safeguarded all her assets, but neither Jeff nor Queenie had noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their arrogance had blinded them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled softly. "Luna, relax. You can't rush these things. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a proper plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a business prodigy. Do you honestly think Queenie knows something I don't?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Queenie's smart. She knew Jace Foliot's main company was already a sinking ship, so she went after the subsidiaries instead. As predicted, she's taken them, but I'd bet my last dollar her liquid assets don't top five hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After New Year's, Luspus' big project will kick off. She's betting on it to save her neck, but it's a black hole&mdash;it'll suck up billions of dollars and drag both her and that Mr. Gellar of hers down with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So sit tight, kid. Let's enjoy the show. Everything's falling into place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana straightened in her chair, her tone casual but brimming with confidence. "Luna, you think those six subsidiaries are cash cows? Think again. Under Queenie, they won't turn a profit for at least three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The real nail in her coffin will be that land in Luspus. But with her mystery man backing her, we need to dig deeper into his finances. Figure out his identity as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing her face. "Diana, I did some digging today. He's a dead ringer for Mr. Gellar, but we couldn't find his name. We only know his last name is Gellar. Beyond that, nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's sharp eyes narrowed. "Amateur work, Luna. Fine, we'll call him Mr. Gellar for now. Track his flight records; that'll give us a starting point. Check the airport surveillance while you're at it&mdash;you're more than capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Luna, sometimes you have to learn from Queenie. The art of playing dumb can be a powerful weapon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna scowled, crossing her arms. "No way, Diana. Queenie's tricks are disgusting. I'm not stooping to her level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sighed dramatically. "Oh, don't be so literal! I'm not telling you to be her. I'm saying there's a time and place for playing dumb, and this is one of those times. Stay out of Queenie's business for now. The New Year's around the corner, and Jace Foliot won't let her off the hook so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meanwhile, we'll have ourselves a peaceful holiday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tone was steady and sure. Once Samuel was dealt with, her path forward would be smooth sailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and by the way, I found some dirt on Andrew Gellar's company. Leak it tomorrow, and we'll have a drama-free New Year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even beggars took time to celebrate the New Year. If they wanted to mess with her holiday, she'd make sure theirs was ruined first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's eyes lit up with excitement. She nodded eagerly. "That's brilliant, Diana! If we have leverage on him, this holiday's going to be great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's smile grew, her confidence radiating through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more thing&mdash;there are only three days left until New Year's. Stock up on gifts and send some over to Alexander and the Farley family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Cecil and Samuel made Diana's gaze turn cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and her mysterious Mr. Gellar wouldn't make things easy for her. Samuel would undoubtedly make a move soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced down at her injured foot. She had no intention of worsening her condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, make sure Nick and his team stay on high alert. Keep an eye out for suspicious vehicles. I don't want any surprises before the holidays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And from now on, I want twenty bodyguards with me whenever I step outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had already stared death in the face once. If she was going to live, she'd respect life enough to fear death just a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You have to be cautious to be alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna chuckled. "Don't worry, Diana. Everything's under control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, her gaze drifting to the snowy view outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The New Year was close, but the sky showed no signs of clearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chill deepened, and tonight promised another heavy snowfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we're done for the day. Let's head home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded. "Got it! Oh, and I had Joseph move into the apartment across the street. His commute was too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana approved with a small nod. "Good call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze shifted to Steven's office, frowning slightly at its stark, gray-and-white decor. It felt cold and lifeless&mdash;a far cry from the bold blue-and-white aesthetic she preferred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Steven was safe for now, and the timing of the Foliot incident was too convenient to be coincidental. It had his fingerprints all over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he remained unharmed, Diana wasn't about to dig too deep. Some mysteries didn't need solving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Steven saw Queenie for what she truly was no longer mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their divorce was final, and that was what counted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered her grandfather's words to her and her siblings&mdash;"Greatness comes through trials. Only after hardship can you rise like a phoenix from the ashes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned off the lights, and Luna pushed her wheelchair out of the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George watched from the surveillance feed as Diana left. His thoughts drifted to Samuel Farley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wouldn't leave Samuel idle for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel had already been imprisoned twice because of Diana. Now that she was injured, he'd see this as his golden opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven quickly sent a message to his security team: [Track Samuel Farley. Keep him under surveillance, and if he goes near Diana, step in immediately.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reply came swiftly: [Understood, Sir.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied, Steven set his phone down and prepared to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drive home was uneventful. Nothing out of the ordinary happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana remained on edge, her senses sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the villa she once shared with Steven, she instructed Luna and the others to rest on the first floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Diana head upstairs to bathe. Afterward, she slipped into a thick, comfortable set of loungewear and limped toward her bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each step sent a sharp jolt of pain through her injured foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she settled into bed, something caught her eye&mdash;a shadow moving behind the curtains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze briefly before recognition clicked. Samuel Farley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Straightening up, she reached for her phone and quickly dialed Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel," she said, her voice steady and cutting. "I was wondering when you'd make your move. You didn't show up on my way home, but it makes sense now. You wouldn't risk the snow&mdash;it'd kill you before you got the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been wondering where you'd put the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now here you are, skulking behind my curtains. Quite the downgrade for someone of your stature."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's dark chuckle filled the room. "Diana, I have to admit, you've got sharp eyes. Didn't expect you to spot me so quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Oh, Mr. Farley, I didn't expect you to be this foolish&mdash;letting Queenie use you as her pawn. Yet here we are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's brow furrowed, confusion flashing in his eyes. "What the hell are you talking about?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="930.html">« Prev</a><a href="932.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
