There was a hint of </span><span>coldness</span><span> in her tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jeff, I'm exhausted."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff froze at her emotionless face. Obviously, she had lost </span><span>her</span><span> interest in it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lay down unwillingly, struck by uneasiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I'm tired, too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula put up a cold smile, her eyes closed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can't wait to see you become infertile.

Didn't I ask you to give them 100,000 dollars last month?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They're </span><span>already </span><span>living a luxurious life with several maids to serve them. Even their clothes are custom-tailored </span><span>for </span><span>every season. What do they need so much money for?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jeff and his parents are all jerks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder those two old bastards want this much money!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They actually </span><span>accepted</span><span> Jeff's keeping a mistress!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That bitch must have got a large sum.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder she can </span><span>afford</span><span> to live in a villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff probably has an illegitimate son with that woman. That explains why he neglects our four sons and daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But who exactly is that bastard?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I haven't found out yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I'm sure Jeff has a son and a daughter outside of our marriage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From now on, I won't let a single penny go to that woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than that, I'll ruin his business in a year, leaving him with nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must protect my children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They will all take my surname one day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of the one of that </span><span>jerk</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff was a little confused. Paula always gave his parents money without asking any questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She has been supporting his family since they got married. Thanks to her generosity, the Marsh family managed to live a luxurious life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was all because Paula loved him with </span><span>consistent</span><span> devotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Barnes family was rich enough. </span><span>A</span><span> million per month </span><span>was very easy</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> Paula.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked for more money this time </span><span>with</span><span> the </span><span>excuse</span><span> of his mum because Queenie's m</span><span>o</span><span>m wanted to buy a bracelet worth 300,000 dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His company's funds were already tied up for his illegitimate son. </span><span>H</span><span>e </span><span>had to </span><span>fool Paula into footing the bill. She was rich, </span><span>anyway</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps, she wants to buy something expensive," Jeff answered smilingly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really?" she responded, "We've missed the chance to cooperate with Azure Group, and suffered huge losses. I went on that business trip to try to make up for it, but it </span><span>was</span><span> in vain."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's tone was tinged with upset. "Jeff, if it continued, our company would go bankrupt. We don't have decent designers for the past couple of years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Gellar family is dominating the market. We've made some profits by cooperating with them, but the business has been </span><span>tough</span><span> these two years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff blinked his eyes, his tone a little weak, "My business relies on yours. The monthly profits </span><span>are little</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was his way of telling Paula that he didn't have money.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Admittedly, doing business had become harder and harder these years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, he didn't believe the Barnes family would go bankrupt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their real estate assets alone were worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon enough, all of their wealth would be his.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was sick of Paula's obsession with cleanliness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even at home, he had to be looking his best.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula echoed, "Mm, in that case, we'll need to cut back and live more frugally. Okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff was shocked. Cut back?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had the Barnes Group reached this point?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff sat up abruptly, his voice in disbelief, "Honey, you're kidding, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="100.html">« Prev</a><a href="102.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
