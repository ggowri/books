Are you going to kick me out of the car again? Make me walk home in the snow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice dripped with sarcasm as she stared at him coldly. "You've already done that three times. If you throw me out again tonight and I end up getting sick, I won't hesitate to drag you down with me. Seriously, I have nothing left to lose. The only reason I'm still alive is to seek revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you don't believe me? Try me. People who aren't afraid of death can do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's hatred reached its peak at that moment, and her words were filled with extremity. She hated the bitter winter and the cold, and the memories of nearly dying in it haunted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the pure hatred in her eyes, Steven's heart trembled violently. It was his own stupidity, his own mistakes, and he knew he owed her everything for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She despised him to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath and admitted, "It was my fault before. I was blind and foolish, unable to see Queenie's true nature. I won't hurt you again. From now on, let's live our lives like we did in the first two years."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Steven drove into the villa's grounds, Diana couldn't be bothered to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply closed her eyes, refusing to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be so lively, her laughter radiant like sunlight, but now she kept her guard up and her defenses sharp whenever he was around.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything that had happened before had been real.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had saved him and cared for him for two years, while Queenie had deceived him repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had been foolish. He had been biased, taking sides without hesitation, always supporting those he cared about most without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they parked, Diana quickly opened the door and got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her walk away, her figure cold and lonely in the biting wind. He remembered those days when he was blind, on a snowy day like this, and she would push him outside for a walk and tell him jokes. Back then, he was too lost in his despair to really listen to what she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had once been happy together, and her love for him had always been so transparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, all he could see in her eyes was hatred that tore his heart to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he thought about it, the more unwilling he became to let things end this way. He rushed after her and forcefully grabbed her hand, pinning her against the wall. One hand circled her waist, the other gripped the back of her head, making it impossible for her to escape. He leaned down and pressed his lips against hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana struggled fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven held her head firmly, leaving her unable to dodge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she resisted, the more his desire to dominate grew within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips were soft and cold from the winter wind, and he felt an urge to warm them with his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss was intense, driven by a wounded male pride. He thought, "She is my wife. Why can't I kiss her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw her laughing and chatting with Cecil earlier, all he could think about was dragging her away and punishing her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a subtle, familiar fragrance on her skin, one that he couldn't resist, and it made his heart beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never felt like this before. It was both uncomfortable and strangely eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all because he had believed the lies of a cunning woman like Queenie, he had missed out on something so beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he found out that it was Diana who had saved him three times, every time he saw her, his heart felt like it was on fire, beating wildly, burning with pain. All he wanted was to hold her tight and kiss her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was breathtakingly beautiful, beautiful to the point of addiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept that she didn't love him anymore. She had once loved him so completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of losing her made Steven angrier. His grip tightened, and he scooped Diana up in his arms and headed towards the nearby, inviting bed.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="659.html">« Prev</a><a href="661.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
