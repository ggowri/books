Now, I'm stuck with a billion-dollar debt. This is infuriating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his phone buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked it up, irritation bubbling beneath the surface. "Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, your wife borrowed 50 million from me, and I need that money tomorrow. I heard she lost her company&mdash;what am I supposed to do about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff snapped back, "How should I know? It's not my debt, and I didn't borrow the money! You should go ask her. We're divorced now, so her problems are not my concern."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Jeff! You wouldn't be where you are today without her. You've achieved nothing on your own. Most of your deals were thanks to her connections. Now that her company's in trouble, you want out of the marriage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Typical&mdash;men who marry into money are always the first to bail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caller hung up, fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face burned with humiliation. The last thing he wanted was for anyone to think he owed his success to Paula's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was true, but he refused to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Paula, fury blazing in his eyes. "Paula, we're getting a divorce tomorrow. This marriage is over. Our relationship is shattered, and you can't pretend otherwise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula stood her ground, her voice firm. "Jeff, I won't divorce you. I refuse to! After all these years of living off my hard work, you owe me help with this debt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding me? You shameless leech! Just because you've hit rock bottom doesn't mean you can drag our son down with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dream on! If you don't agree to the divorce tomorrow, I'll spill the beans about how you've been giving your money to gigolos outside. I'll make sure everyone knows you're trying to ruin my son's future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And those four little bastards you call kids? You can take them and leave!" Tracey, Jeff's mother, interjected, her tone unyielding. This marriage was done for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, with tears brimming in his eyes, pleaded, "Grandma, you think we're all just bastards? I give you 10 thousand dollars a month! Is this how you repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey's expression darkened as she regarded him, thinking, "Eric is such a disappointment. My eldest grandson outside is doing so much better&mdash;he sends me 100 thousand a month.</span><span> </span><span>What's Eric's measly 10 thousand compared to that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With newfound confidence, Tracey was eager to cut ties with what she saw as dead weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's heart ached as he realized just how toxic his family truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Jeff, his voice icy. "If you hate us so much, why did you even have us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! I had no choice; your mother wanted kids. What could I do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff deflected, shifting the blame onto Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked at Eric, her heart breaking. "Eric, do you want to stay with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric shook his head, knowing what he had to do. He thought, "Mom knows I have to make this choice. It's the only way I can help her." He whispered, "I'm sorry, Mom. You've lost everything, and I can't follow you. I need to stay with Dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula shut her eyes in pain, thinking, "I know Eric wants to support me, but he's no match for Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had to play along with her son's act. She snapped at him, "Eric, you're so heartless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric felt a crushing weight in his chest, shame flooding over him. He lowered his gaze, forcing out the words he didn't mean. "I'm sorry, Mom. I... I can't live without Queenie and Dad."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="558.html">« Prev</a><a href="560.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
