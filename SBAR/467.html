"About divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shook his head firmly. "Diana, I've made it clear&mdash;I won't divorce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a glare. "You ungrateful jerk! I've taken care of you for two years, and now that we're getting a divorce, you give me that? Let's get divorced, and I'm gonna see other men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt that since he was being unreasonable, she wouldn't play nice anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was incensed. "Diana, are you really that desperate? You feel hollow and want to find other men because we haven't had sex?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana threw him a disdainful look. "Mr. Gellar, thanks for not sleeping with me. If you had, I'd feel gross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, Queenie has slept with Jace and punks. If I were to sleep with you, I'd feel sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shuddered all over, his expression darkening even further, his aloofness deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Diana, I didn't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, there you are!" Nolan's sudden appearance interrupted Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face lit up at the sight of him. "Mr. Watson, you're finally here. I have the design drafts ready. I need to go, so just call me if you need anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan looked puzzled. "Diana, aren't you going to come up and relax for a bit? I prepared your favorite orange juice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Nope, you should have brought it down to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan smiled. "I thought you might want to catch up upstairs. It's been a while since you've been here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced around the place. Leopold had handed the company over to her, yet she'd only been here once or twice, with Nolan managing everything in her absence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's been two years," she said, smiling. "See you later, Mr. Watson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan noticed Steven and didn't keep her. Instead, he gave her a nod and watched her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Diana was gone, Steven turned to Nolan. "Mr. Watson, about..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I've thought it over, and I'm on board with the cooperation," Nolan replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled faintly. "Great! Let's arrange to have dinner soon and discuss the contract."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'm heading up now. Take care, Mr. Gellar," Nolan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Nolan left, Steven rushed after Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to get into her car when he grabbed her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at his hand around hers, then back at him, disgust flashing in her eyes. "Let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her protest, Steven pulled her into his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the door shut, he told Evan. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana scowled. "Mr. Gellar, please stop it. I don't want to ride in the same car as you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her sideways, taking in her light makeup and undeniable beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint, arrogant smile, he replied, "Diana, you're my wife, and I have every right to expect you to fulfill your wifely duties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly looked at him nervously. "Mr. Gellar, Queenie is not around, so you need someone to satisfy your needs?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="466.html">« Prev</a><a href="468.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
