Recently, he has been cooperating with the Farley family and will not care about Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Maybe it will be a good idea to teach Diana a lesson.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I hope she will behave in the future.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula looked at the scorching sky and felt annoyed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;What is the tragic fate that Diana mentioned?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Bad things always make people overthink.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Diana&#x27;s words are true. I did paternity tests in these two places, and someone may have replaced the samples.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Over the years, Jeff has never made me doubt him. Is it really that Diana is talking nonsense?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula&#x27;s mind was in a mess. She didn&#x27;t know what to do for a moment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was in early autumn and was still hot.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was taken to a luxury car with the air conditioner on by two bodyguards.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Despite this, Diana still broke out in a sweat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was stuffed into the backseat. Looking at the sign with the word &quot;Farley&quot; on the car, she knew that the two bodyguards were from the Farley family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Farley family was a wealthy noble family with its family emblem.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna had already inquired. Rita had not woken up yet and was still lying in the hospital. Only by seeing Rita and waking her up could Diana be cleared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana thought, &quot;When I arrived at the club, I knew that someone was following me and that Cecil had been looking for me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I knew it was the people Cecil sent.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After being reborn, I found myself. I will never live as useless as I did in my previous life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I will not let Cecil bully me for Queenie&#x27;s fake life-saving favor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie is excellent and also knows how to use computers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Why am I there in the video? Only Queenie, who is most familiar with me, can make it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was quickly taken to the hospital by two bodyguards. She was taken directly to Rita&#x27;s ward.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What surprised Diana was that Steven and Queenie were also there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s eyes became gloomy when he saw her being pressed in by two bodyguards.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;Diana is still my woman now. Cecil really doesn&#x27;t take me seriously.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Queenie&#x27;s eyes were filled with gloat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked straight over. The man sitting next to Rita&#x27;s bed looked handsome, and the emotions in his eyes were intense.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Diana saw his face, she immediately forgot about Steven beside her. It was a perfect face. It had a noble, elegant, and evil temperament. It was very charming. This man was bright and attractive.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled and was in a good mood.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But a satiric voice sounded, disturbing Diana&#x27;s good mood.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, Madam Farley was pushed into the water by you. She hasn&#x27;t woken up yet. How can you laugh? Do you have a conscience?&quot; said Queenie.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="15.html">« Prev</a><a href="17.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
