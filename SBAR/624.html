If he sent her to the hospital, she would relish the moment, flaunting a victorious smile to Diana, revealing that Steven didn't care about her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie didn't expect Steven to just sit there, cold and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's harsh words echoed in her mind. She fought back tears, her lips slightly parted, looking utterly aggrieved and pitiful. She was counting on Steven to take her to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the ache in her stomach was becoming harder to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven... I..." She hesitated, trying to be pitiful and vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched, stunned by her performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "What a phony. No wonder Steven is so entranced by her; any man would fall for that helpless facade."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven paused, glanced at Diana, and said, "Let's just do this next time. I'll take her to the hospital first, then come back to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and nodded. "Go ahead. If she faints from the pain, you'll be heartbroken."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she was relieved not to be in love with Steven anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, he always seemed to choose Queenie over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the satisfied and indifferent look on Diana's face ignited anger within Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She truly didn't care anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shocked that Steven was still treating her kindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't hide her surprise, thinking, "That life-saving favor really works.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana can never compete with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feigning pain, Queenie bent over, then stood up and shot Diana a provocative smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana saw this coming and raised an eyebrow, smirking, "You were just about to pass out from pain, and now you're full of energy to provoke me? Queenie, you really are a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Diana, are you calling me a joke?" Queenie yelled, her voice rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil jumped in, "You still have the energy to shout. Seems like the stomachache is just an act, and your real goal is sympathy. I've never seen such a shameless homewrecker openly trying to seduce someone else's husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked around, worried about being recognized. The label of "homewrecker" would haunt her for life if that happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but find it amusing. Queenie knew she was the other woman but pretended to be innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Diana said, "Cecil, how could you say that? You're embarrassing Ms. Marsh. After all, she has a protector. You shouldn't be like someone, insulting his wife while being involved with another woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was stunned, staring at Diana's smiling face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit hard, making him feel overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized in Diana's eyes, everything he did was an insult to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she say such things if she wasn't deeply disappointed?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, he couldn't defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil quickly chimed in, "Diana, don't worry. I would never do that. If I fell in love, it would be wholeheartedly."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, clearly satisfied. But as Steven looked at her smile, the anger within him surged again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Queenie, he said in a flat tone, "Let's go to the hospital, or the pain will go away. I don't want to waste the trip."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze, realizing he saw through her act.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, why are you being so harsh too?" Queenie nearly cried out of frustration.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="623.html">« Prev</a><a href="625.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
