"Gale, how can I threaten you? I am doing this for the sake of your health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you just say you didn't even have the strength to lift your hands or sign your name? You are too weak to check your phone, aren't you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, you don't love me at all." She felt more and more upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale looked at her pretentious appearance, and at that moment, it seemed as if something was shattered into pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Giving it to you is a token of my love for you. Otherwise, it means I don't care about you. Queenie, you clearly know that the 5% of the shares is my only income. Are you so kind that you are going to take this away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, a policeman came to the ward and interrupted Queenie, who was about to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Jeff Marsh, Ms. Bishop is here. Please go over and make a statement."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff and Queenie glanced at each other. He smiled, "Okay. We'll be there in a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked over, picked up a pen, and put it in Gale's hand. "Gale, hurry up. Something happened to the company. I need the shares to help Paula."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale knew that the company was in a difficult situation and that Paula handled it on her own. "Okay! I can give the shares to my mother, but not you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff compromised. "Okay. Sign your name, and the share transfer agreement will belong to Paula."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The agreement was printed on special paper. The name would appear in the light, and he could manipulate it at will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale growled, "Ask my mother to come. I want to see her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he hadn't been lying down and unable to move, he would have gone to find Paula himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had a vague feeling that she was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, what are you thinking about? Do you assume we are tricking you out of your shares? When you go abroad, Penelope and her child can live on your shares. In your current state, you can't make money to support them. How can they live?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was Gale's sore spot. Queenie understood that he loved Penelope very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of Penelope, he became much firmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't make a living now. After leaving the shares to them, he could focus on his treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He might sell the car dealership for hundreds of millions of dollars to treat his legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, he couldn't let Penelope and their child suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, I'll give you the shares. During the time I'm away for treatment, please take care of Penelope and our child. I'll get my legs healed and come back to look after them as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale picked up the pen with difficulty and signed his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff wouldn't ignore his own grandchild, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie and Jeff breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was very excited. "Gale, take a good rest. I will go to deal with Diana. She must pay the price."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale said painfully, "She is my biological sister, after all. My legs are just crippled. Let her go to jail and teach her a lesson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sneered. This time, she tried her best to kill Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was easiest to create an accident after Gale went abroad. Queenie and Jeff left the ward quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale closed his eyes uncomfortably when someone said, "Gale, you really let me down!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="226.html">« Prev</a><a href="228.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
