"No need. I have a wife; I don't need another date."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was shocked. Wife? He had admitted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her face was filled with hurt, her voice laced with barely contained sarcasm. "Steven, you couldn't even admit you were married, and now you're calling her your wife. What about everything you've done to me?" Queenie knew Steven's personality well, understanding how to trigger his sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At tonight's banquet, she had set a trap that would make Steven utterly despise Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared deeply into her mocking eyes. "If you think what I did to you was wrong, then return the billions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven threw his coat onto the table, tugging at his tie in frustration. Ever since Diana had left home, he hadn't felt any peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was taken aback, a glimmer of surprise flashing in her eyes. He had changed. He truly had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even when she attempted suicide, he didn't react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He really didn't care about her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she still had a trump card, and tonight Steven would definitely take her along. "Steven, your father's back, and he insisted that I be your date for tonight's banquet. He's never liked Diana. If you don't want him to trouble her, you'd better take me instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was her leverage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's dad, Andrew Gellar, treated her like his own daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The only one who despised her was Steven's mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had seen through Queenie's schemes, but it didn't matter. In the end, Queenie got her sent to a mental hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That's how people are. Some see the truth but stay silent, while others speak out but aren't believed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wasn't Steven the same before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He disliked Diana, wanting to distance himself from her, seeing the truth but refusing to acknowledge it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With these connections, Diana could never beat her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She gently reminded him, "Steven, you know your father always looked down on Diana, thinking she wasn't worthy. Now that she's left you and the Marsh family, it would be easy for him to do something to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie knew that Steven understood his father's cruelty better than anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's parents had an arranged marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew had swallowed up his wife's family business within two years of their marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew spent his days living extravagantly outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, after taking over Steven's mother's family business, Andrew made a public spectacle of proposing to a college student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The whole of Capitole knew about it, and people talked enviously about that grand proposal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's mother not only lost her family but also became the biggest joke and victim of the marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If anyone was to blame, it was his mother's naivety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had placed all her hopes on a man, only to end up with nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Andrew's cruelty was unmatched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven understood this better than anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her words made Steven's gaze turn icy. He knew better than anyone the extent of his father's tactics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was the most innocent person in all of this, yet Queenie was still using threats against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. "Queenie, it seems I need to get to know you better. You're not as simple as you seem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After coldly dropping this remark, Steven headed upstairs to change his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A flash of shock crossed Queenie's eyes. To protect Diana, he had agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie felt both jealous and hurt. "Steven, you can only love me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana, tonight, you're doomed."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="193.html">« Prev</a><a href="195.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
