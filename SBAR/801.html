What is it?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Felicity&#x27;s voice was tense. &quot;Ms. Marsh, there&#x27;s trouble. Someone reported our branch for tax evasion, and the authorities are already investigating. If they dig deep, they&#x27;re bound to uncover that hundred million we skimmed last time.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Queenie&#x27;s face turned pale. &quot;Who the hell had the nerve to report my company?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her business couldn&#x27;t afford this kind of disruption right now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s mind raced, but she couldn&#x27;t think of who might be behind it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Felicity sounded equally helpless. The incident with Paula&#x27;s company had also happened quietly, and she hadn&#x27;t been able to stop it at all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We haven&#x27;t figured out who did it yet. They came so fast, and we had no way to stop them. And if this leaks to the media, it&#x27;ll destroy our reputation. Our stock will plummet.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie rubbed her temples, seething with frustration. Everything had been going wrong recently.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Get in touch with Phillip immediately. He&#x27;s a top hacker. Tell him to erase any traces of the tax records. Meanwhile, do whatever you can to stall the investigation team. Buy him as much time as possible.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Understood! I called him as soon as this started. He&#x27;s already on it, and I&#x27;ll do everything I can to delay them.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie felt a wave of relief and smirked confidently. &quot;Good. I trust his skills. Even if someone has evidence, we&#x27;ll muddle it up enough to throw them off. Whoever tried to bring me down will regret it. Follow my instructions to the letter!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After hanging up, she exhaled, feeling more in control.</p><p style="text-align:left;">People thought she was just some woman leaning on men, but her company&#x27;s hidden wealth was her real power.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie had always pinned her hopes on Gale, and Queenie knew that meant she might not even have a place in her mother&#x27;s heart in the future.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t count on anyone but herself. Money in her own hands was the only thing she could really trust.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Still, her heart wasn&#x27;t at ease. She slipped into her slippers and paced around the room, anxious for news. She knew it&#x27;d take time, but she just couldn&#x27;t wait calmly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t take any more setbacks.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The project would start in the spring, but it&#x27;d be at least two years before the funds came back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">During that time, making money would be hard enough, so she couldn&#x27;t afford to lose any more.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, she heard a knock at the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie felt a flicker of irritation. Anyone who came looking for her now was bound to make her mood worse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She walked over slowly, checking the monitor, and saw that it was Amelie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A wave of bitterness swept over her. She&#x27;d spent a night in the hospital alone, and Amelie hadn&#x27;t even called. If it had been Paula, she would&#x27;ve been there by her side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie realized that Amelie&#x27;s declarations of love had always been just words without any real substance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She opened the door, taking in Amelie&#x27;s pale face and troubled look. Frowning, Queenie asked, &quot;Mom, what&#x27;s wrong? You look really upset.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie let out a frustrated sigh, collapsing onto the sofa. She glanced at her daughter&#x27;s pale face, a pang of guilt hitting her hard.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had just gone through a miscarriage, yet she hadn&#x27;t been there to take care of her. The fact that she hadn&#x27;t raised Queenie herself only made the guilt worse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s... nothing too serious. I went to a hotel with Mark today, and your father caught us there. He agreed to file for divorce with me tomorrow. He agreed so quickly it made me uneasy.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She knew Jeff wasn&#x27;t one to give in so easily. His willingness to let go without a fight only raised her suspicions.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="800.html">« Prev</a><a href="802.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
