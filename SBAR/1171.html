Looking at his beaming face, she could tell he genuinely wanted this baby. His handsome features radiated the pure joy of becoming a father for the first time&mdash;he hadn't stopped smiling. "The baby's just a tiny bean right now. How could it be mischievous? We won't feel anything until the fourth month when it starts moving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was over the moon, buying several of every fruit. Diana watched him pile up groceries, noticing how much more attentive he'd become. "Steven, this isn't the only place that sells fruit. How am I supposed to finish all this? I eat maybe one or two pieces a day&mdash;this'll take me half a month to get through."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven hefted the two heavy bags. "Come on, Diana. Let's grab lunch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm-hmm&mdash;" Diana peeled an orange as they walked. Steven couldn't help but smile at her adorable greediness. Her innocent charm never changed, and neither did her love. Only now did the full weight of it hit him&mdash;the overwhelming satisfaction of having a child, having Diana. Possessing both Diana and their baby felt like grasping stars that had once seemed impossibly distant, a luxury he'd never dared dream of. Now that it was real, pure happiness flooded through him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the restaurant, Diana finished her orange. She reached for another, but Steven stopped her. "Diana, just a taste is enough," he said gently. "You barely eat as it is. If you fill up now, you won't have room for lunch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana considered this&mdash;she did want to eat more fish later. "Alright, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana jogged toward the restaurant, but Steven caught her arm. She looked at him, puzzled. "What now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven laughed helplessly. "Silly girl, you're carrying our child. Don't rush around like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: "......"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled. "Steven, I'm just pregnant, not made of glass. A little jog won't hurt anything. Stop being so paranoid&mdash;when you're nervous, it makes me nervous too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven couldn't help himself. Her casual attitude only made him more anxious. "Diana, let me hold your hand. We'll take it slow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven carried the fruit in one hand and held hers with the other. Diana glanced down at their intertwined fingers, a smile tugging at her lips as warmth spread through her chest. "Steven, you're so gentle now. I'm just realizing how soft-hearted I am&mdash;how easy I am to win over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Diana, you're anything but easy. I've been trying to win you back for over a year, and I'm still not there yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was impossible to please. Even after clearing up their misunderstanding, he'd been fighting to get her back. But she'd been prickly with him, their every encounter ending in arguments. Diana shot him a look. "You haven't won me back yet. I'm only temporarily forgiving you&mdash;I haven't really forgiven you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven fell silent, quietly leading her to the restaurant. Hubery sighed with relief when he saw them return, then frowned at the mountain of fruit Steven carried. "Steven, why didn't you just buy the whole store? What's all this for? You should buy fresh fruit daily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shrugged, setting the bags on a nearby table before carefully helping Diana into her seat. "Tomorrow's fruit might be yesterday's stock anyway. I got a little of everything so Diana can have whatever she's craving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery: "......"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally understood why Diana couldn't let Steven go. The man was genuinely devoted&mdash;the way he treasured every little thing about Diana, his gentle, focused attention, how his eyes held only her. Aside from that whole Queenie mess, the guy had a clean record.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His older brothers had told him that Steven and Queenie were just putting on an act&mdash;there was no real intimacy between them. Now they'd turned against each other, and Steven's heart belonged to Diana. Before, he hadn't quite believed Steven could truly turn over a new leaf. But watching Steven's devotion to Diana throughout this trip, all his doubts vanished in an instant. Turns out, trusting someone could happen just like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hubery smiled. All he wanted was his sister's happiness. If Steven could bring her joy and open his heart to her completely, that was enough. A person couldn't be too greedy. Hubery reminded himself of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the food arrived. Garlic shrimp&mdash;Diana's eyes lit up the moment she saw it. Both Hubery and Steven put on disposable gloves and quickly peeled the shrimp shells for her. Diana looked at the mountain of shrimp meat on her plate, her eyes crinkling with delight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Having you two makes me so happy. I'm digging in!" Diana picked up her fork and started eating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Steven and Hubery wore indulgent smiles. All three of them thoroughly enjoyed the meal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three days later, the trio returned to Capitole. This time, Diana brought Steven home with her. Leopold, Tobias, and Julius were all waiting at the front gate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, Tobias, Second Brother, I'm home!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana ran toward Leopold with a bright smile, throwing herself into his arms. Leopold's eyes reddened with emotion as he gently patted her back. "Oh, my Diana's finally home. Grandpa missed you so much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was equally moved&mdash;there was nothing like coming home. "Grandpa, I missed you all too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You silly girl, you're going to be a mother now, but you're still so reckless. No more running around&mdash;walk properly from now on." Leopold scolded her lovingly. This was wonderful&mdash;the Bishop and Young families would have heirs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hehe..." Diana laughed, then turned to look at Steven. "Steven, I brought you back here to my home, which means I forgive you. Now hurry up and kowtow to Grandpa to show your gratitude!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven froze, staring at her blankly for a long moment before her words sank in. Diana had forgiven him? The joy on his face was impossible to contain. "Diana, thank you! Diana, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over and respectfully knelt before Leopold, addressing everyone formally: "Grandpa, Tobias, Second Brother, Hubery, thank you for accepting me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold helped him to his feet, speaking earnestly: "Son, if you want to thank someone, thank your grandfather. If he hadn't insisted, I never would have married my granddaughter to you. You broke my granddaughter's heart completely. You better never hurt my Diana again, understand?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked solemnly at the old man: "Don't worry, Grandpa. I won't disappoint you again, and I certainly won't disappoint Diana. Before, I thought I was protecting her, but I still ended up hurting her. Now, I'll love Diana and our child even more than before. I'll spend my whole life making up for my past mistakes and giving her the most secure happiness."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1170.html">« Prev</a><a href="1172.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
