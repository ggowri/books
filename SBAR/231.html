It's been half a year. And there's still a year and a half left. I can afford to wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Tobias left without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and took a deep breath. Now, no matter what he did, she would not believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As before she wanted to explain, but he never gave her a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of her hesitant look and her painful eyes, he felt upset. However, with his busy work and the crying Queenie, he didn't want to see upset Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't understand why he trusted Queenie so much and hurt Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Diana hadn't fought back, he wouldn't have seen that Queenie could be so vicious and disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven left the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias handed Diana some breakfast and said, "Diana, this sandwich is delicious. There is water. Drink the water before eating."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was touched. Tobias had always loved her sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay!" She drank some water and began to eat her sandwich.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anything tasted good when she was hungry, but the sandwich was really good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked out the window. The sun was shining. It was a beautiful day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was in a brighter mood now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, she was in a lot of pain but never talked about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, if she felt pain, she would tell Tobias and Leopold or complain to her friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had defeated her former cowardly self and worked hard to grow up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After breakfast, Diana said, "Tobias, let's go to the hospital. I want to see what happened to Gale. I'll feel bad if I don't go. I left him alone for so long, just for this day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias looked at her with amusement. "Why? Are you trying to make yourself angry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and shook her head. "No, I just went to see a joke. In the past, they blackmailed me. Now that I have severed ties with the family, I want to go and laugh at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The greatest malice of man is to wish misfortune upon others. I want to bring my malice to the extreme."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled and opened the map. Diana told him the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Twenty minutes later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana came to the ward alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ward was filled with a strong smell of disinfectant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was also in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale woke up and leaned against the head of the bed. In the night, he had experienced a catastrophe. He was decadent and had no desire to live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked in. Paula saw her and was excited. "Diana, you are here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled coldly, "Yes, I came here just to laugh at you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was stunned, and her eyes dimmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale looked at Diana's smiling face with mixed feelings. Half a year ago, it was Queenie and Penelope who plotted against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still couldn't accept the truth now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale thought, "Why would Queenie, whom I had loved since childhood, treat me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing his crippled legs, he suddenly asked angrily, "Diana, did you do this on purpose?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="230.html">« Prev</a><a href="232.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
