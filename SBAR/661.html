"Steven, what are you doing? This is illegal, you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's deep eyes were darkened with desire, and he let out a deep chuckle. "Diana, don't forget. You're my wife. Fulfilling your marital duties is your responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." Diana shook her head nervously, adamantly refusing. She couldn't let this happen with Steven in this life. "Steven, go find Queenie. Don't touch me. If you dare, I'll expose everything about you and Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the only thing she had left to threaten him with.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven froze, stopping in his tracks as he looked at her face full of rejection. His eyes turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp, defined features took on a murderous look as his penetrating gaze locked onto her defiant face. "Diana, repeat what you just said."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was frigid, yet he was still disturbingly handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a shiver run through her. She knew Steven was not only cold on the surface but even more terrifying underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And because she knew him well, she feared him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven cared about someone, he would protect that person at all costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, he trusted Queenie, and in the end, Queenie took everything from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ironic that his trust turned out to be a one-sided illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summoning her courage, Diana continued, "Mr. Gellar, I know you don't love me. I know you don't like me. Queenie is the only person you truly care about, and the love between you two is something I can never interfere with. I was foolish before, but now, I'm staying far away. I won't come between you two anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't touch me, please. You've always remained loyal to Queenie, haven't you? If you touch me, then your love for her won't be so pure anymore. All your dedication would have been for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I know you're acting on impulse. You're just frustrated. Go find Queenie, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's got a better body, she's more gentle, more beautiful, and she knows how to please you. Every time she sent me photos and videos of you two in bed, you looked so... satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't finish her sentence, not under Steven's burning, furious stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wisely clamped her mouth shut, knowing that his anger had quelled his impulses.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana valued purity in a relationship, preferring someone who shared that value. She knew society had changed and people were more liberal now, but she couldn't let go of her principles.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't meet Steven's eyes. His deep gaze was unreadable, hiding his emotions behind an impassive facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven set her down on the bed, letting out a cold laugh. "Diana, weren't you the one who claimed to love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't understand how someone who supposedly loved him couldn't tell whether it was truly him or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was momentarily confused, not knowing why he was questioning her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't answer him. Instead, she quickly slipped under the covers, pulling the blanket tight around herself as she warily watched Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes narrowed slightly at her defensive actions. "Diana, you dare claim to love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pain pierced Diana's heart, and tears welled up at the corners of her eyes. "Yes, I did love you once. But my love was worn away, bit by bit, by your coldness, your cruelty, and your favoritism. I've said this so many times, and I don't want to explain it anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared deeply at her and asked, "Diana, was your love just something you convinced yourself of? If you really loved me, how could you not recognize the real me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="660.html">« Prev</a><a href="662.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
