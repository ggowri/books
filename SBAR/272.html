Her body was wracked with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She lay across the desk, and her face was streaked with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cursed, "Damn it! My tears are so easily shed. Why do I always have to cry? I don't want to cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was wallowing in sadness when Luna entered the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Bishop, Mr. Tobias Bishop bought a cake and sent it over," Luna announced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No sooner had Luna finished speaking than Tobias showed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bathed in the warm glow of the sun, he was tall and straight, with flawless facial features and an air of cool nobility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'm here," he said with affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana quickly wiped away her tears and ran to him with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tobias, you're here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!" Tobias looked at her reddened eyes. A cold light flickered in his own. "I ran into Steven downstairs. Did he bully you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, he can't bully me anymore. I cried because I'm leaving him. I'm very happy," Diana said, her smile turning her tears into scattered starlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias gazed at her deeply, his heart aching for the injustices she had endured over the years. "When you're sad, have something sweet. It'll lift your spirits. Chocolate cake is your favorite, and this shop's cream is the most delicious. It's freshly made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sit down. I'll feed you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana happily took her seat beside him, ready to be pampered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna poured two cups of coffee and left with a knowing smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gazed at Tobias, his hands capturing her attention like a masterpiece in a gallery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sunlight streamed in, filling the office with a quiet warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias opened the box, picked up a spoon, and fed Diana a mouthful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She ate it with delight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Delicious!" she exclaimed with a radiant smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Indeed! On your birthday, Julius told me he'd come back for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was overjoyed. Her birthday was October 1st, the day Leopold had taken her in, not the same day as Queenie's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had been found in the woods, abandoned by Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person who found her was also Jeff, and from the start, he hadn't wanted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there was one thing she couldn't understand: why had Jeff brought her back in the end?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't figured out the question in her past life, but she still couldn't fathom it in this life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pondered, "Queenie and I were both daughters; why did he not want me? Was it truly because he didn't love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a pang in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, what are you thinking about? Eat up." Tobias was as gentle as ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing. I'm just so happy to have you feed me," Diana said, opening her mouth for another bite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After eating half, she couldn't manage anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias covered the cake and placed it in the refrigerator, declaring, "Diana, I'm going on a business trip for half a month. Be good while I'm gone. If you have any issues, call my assistant. Don't put yourself in a tough spot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gently tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and nodded. "Okay! Tobias, take care on your trip and remember to eat well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias smiled, patting her head. "Got it, silly girl. Grandpa is traveling with Sir Powell. You'll be alone at home. If you get lonely, I'll video call you every night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa's traveling?" Did Leopold have such a good relationship with Roy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes! I heard from Grandpa that he's looking for a birthday present for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was so touched that tears threatened to spill again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias told her not to cry and then took his leave. Diana returned to her work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she sat down, a message from the servant she had placed within the Marsh Villa reached her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Ms. Bishop, last night, Frank came back with his girlfriend and was kicked out by Mrs. Paula Marsh. Mr. Jeff Marsh fainted at home and was sent to the hospital.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was taken aback. Paula should have fallen ill by now, so why was it Jeff who was sent to the hospital?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="271.html">« Prev</a><a href="273.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
