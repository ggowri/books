"Diana, you're still the same&mdash;stupid and kind. I knew you'd come."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want me to let them go? Have you forgotten how they treated you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie pointed toward where she'd been tied up in her past life. "Diana, right here in my past life, I staged a whole show to frame you, making Paula believe you orchestrated it all. Just to make your mother and four brothers completely despise you&mdash;that performance was absolutely satisfying to watch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That was Christmas Eve. We were tied up here, with the freezing winter outside. Under those brilliant fireworks, you died in the most brutal way at the bottom of this building."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know why I made them torture you for three days before letting you die? I wanted your birth parents and those four brothers you kept trying to please to personally send you to hell."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie gestured wildly toward Paula, her expression manic. "Diana, you could've been rescued on the first day. I'd already told Paula our location and asked her to save you first. She didn't come for you. The kidnappers released me first, then she came. She abandoned you right then, chose to save me instead, letting those kidnappers do whatever they wanted to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I deliberately made the kidnappers drag it out for four days, and your four brothers didn't disappoint me. Every single day, they said something to torture you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale had them break both your hands. Frank had them destroy your face. Eric had them break both your legs&mdash;all just so the kidnappers would give me one more spoonful of hot food."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale and Eric's eyes widened. Given their past treatment of Diana, they could indeed have done such things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie continued, "They did every vicious thing to you, and you still chose to save them. Diana, you idiot&mdash;I really can't figure out if you're kind or just stupid."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's body swayed slightly. With each description, she could feel the excruciating pain from her past life, along with the hatred and despair in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, and what made you most desperate was being pushed off the building by the person you loved most. In your past life, you didn't know George existed&mdash;you thought Steven was the one who pushed you. To make you die in complete despair, I had him push you off that building with his own hands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You were already four months pregnant then. Steven actually protected you pretty well. I finally remembered how he died in the past life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Steven with hatred, screaming in anguish, "His death brought about your rebirth and my miserable life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana whipped around to look at Steven. "How did you die?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head. "I don't know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven died while praying outside the church."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia's voice came from behind them. Diana was shocked. "Qiqi, how do you know?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia, wearing an emerald-green traditional dress, walked slowly toward Diana. "Diana, the reason you could come back is because Steven saw you and the child die tragically. He went to The Sacred Abbey and knelt for three days and nights, trading his life for yours, asking for you to have another chance. Many things in this world can't be explained&mdash;dig too deep and you can't glimpse the ways of heaven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the one who killed you was George. Good and evil balance out, cause and effect balance out. Steven used his life to ensure you'd both be safe in this lifetime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia looked at Steven, her smile blooming like lilies. "Steven, you did it. A true heart can move not only the people around you, but heaven itself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was amazed. "</span><span>Olivia</span><span>, </span><span>t</span><span>he Sacred Abbey is right next to your temple, so..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia smiled. "So, Diana, with the right intentions, time can intersect. But not everyone gets such an opportunity&mdash;you need an absolutely devoted heart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, now you can believe Steven's true feelings for you, right? Actually, in your past life, he came to love you desperately too. When you died at his feet, he gave up everything just to beg for a chance to start over with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia then turned to Queenie: "Queenie, in your past life as Ms. Marsh, you already used up all your luck and fortune for that lifetime. But you weren't satisfied&mdash;you treated everyone as stepping stones and destroyed countless lives. So this life is your true form."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The howling wind in the unfinished building swept across Olivia's bangs, and the profound light in her eyes made it impossible to look directly at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie roared in unwillingness: "No! That's not how it is! Everything belongs to me, and you'll all die by my hands! What are you to dare speak to me like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia's eyes turned ice-cold: "Queenie, what goes around comes around. Debts owed to others must always be repaid."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's expression turned manic: "What if I don't pay them back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly untied the ropes binding Paula, yanked her to her feet, and looked at Diana: "Diana, jump from over there, and I'll spare your mother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula shook her head in anguish: "Diana, don't! Don't listen to her! Don't worry about me&mdash;you all need to get out of here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched her suffering and slowly clenched her hands at her sides. All grudges should be settled after death. After her rebirth, she had changed everyone's fate&mdash;Paula didn't die, her four brothers didn't die, Cecil was alive, Joseph was alive, and Steven was alive too. All these key people had survived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Queenie: "Queenie, it's not too late to turn back. Let my mother go now, and there's still time to make things right."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Paula heard Diana say "my mother," she smiled: "Diana, you're finally willing to call me mom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears streamed down Diana's face: "When someone dies, everything ends. I was too obsessed with the pain from my past life. But no matter how you hurt me, you're still the one who gave birth to me and gave me life. Hating you all has been painful for me too. Now I have someone I love, and I'm carrying his baby. I don't want to hate you anymore. Everything in the past was Queenie's manipulation. I hope that after I forgive you, you can all live well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula laughed through her tears: "Diana, if there really was a past life, don't forgive mom for all the things I did to hurt you. From now on, take care of your baby and live a good life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, seeing the determination in her eyes, and asked urgently: "Mom, what are you planning to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at her with gentle eyes&mdash;her daughter was so beautiful. But after this, she would never see her precious daughter's happiness again. She smiled and said: "Diana, in the past life, it was mom's favoritism toward Queenie that killed you. Diana, mom wants to protect you one last time. Mom blesses you&mdash;may you live this life free from pain and illness, forever healthy, happy, and blessed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Paula suddenly turned around and threw her body against Queenie, and both of them fell from the unfinished building together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Paula suddenly turned around and threw her body against Queenie, and both of them fell from the unfinished building together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Paula suddenly turned around and threw her body against Queenie, and both of them fell from the unfinished building together.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1174.html">« Prev</a><a href="1176.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
