"Queenie, have you been scheming against me all these years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie raised an eyebrow, feigning confusion, then broke into a mischievous smile. "Oh, poor little guy. If thinking that way makes you feel better, Mr. Wyatt Farley, then by all means, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her red lips curved into a smile, openly flaunting her duplicity. She never pretended to be a good person. On Instagram, she shared glimpses of a perfect life, but behind the scenes, her world was filled with secrets and lies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the world, Queenie respected her elders and teachers, but in private, she tarnished their reputations and spoke ill of them. That was who she was. Only Diana could see through her facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's soft exterior hid her ruthless core. Her acts of kindness were nothing more than a tool to build a saintly image in front of others. Yet, all of it was a sham, and only Diana truly saw through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this exact moment, Wyatt finally saw Queenie for who she was. He spoke through gritted teeth, "Queenie, you used a fake partnership to lure me in, all so you could fulfill your ambitions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to "Steven," Wyatt sneered, "Are you going to marry a woman this deceitful, Mr. Gellar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fake Steven smiled, pulling Queenie into his arms and planting a kiss on her cheek before replying, "Come on, Mr. Wyatt Farley. Business is like war. If you lose, you lose. It's not about deceit&mdash;it's about your inability to judge character. In the business world, every decision is a gamble. One misstep, and you risk losing everything. Don't blame your opponent's cunning or the unfavorable circumstances. Blame yourself for failing to see through people and distinguish truth from lies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's body trembled, but he had no retort. When it came to business, Steven wasn't wrong. Wyatt thought bitterly, "It's bad enough Queenie schemed against my son. But going after my company? Over my dead body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt sneered, completely unfazed by Queenie. "Even if my son ends up in prison, don't think for a second that it'll crush me or knock me down. I've got an illegitimate son, too. My son might spend a few years behind bars, but he'll be out eventually. My company, though? I'd never hand it over to a woman as vicious as you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie found his naivety amusing and pondered, "How could he think that way? When I target someone, I aim to destroy them completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and said, "You're still so naive. Do you think I'd be standing here if I weren't confident about acquiring your company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie continued, "The Foliot family fell to me just yesterday. A small company like yours? I could take it down in a single day. Here's the evidence of your tax evasion and asset transfers. If your wife finds out about this, she'll tear you apart. When your family is in shambles, that's when I'll step in and take over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before your wife discovers what you've been doing, sell your company to me at a </span><span>low price. At least then, you'll have the means to secure a future for your illegitimate child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident Queenie had prepared meticulously for this confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's eyes burned with anger. "That's impossible," he snapped. But inwardly, he roared, "Queenie might be clever, but does she think I'm an easy target?" He smirked and said, "You can report me all you want. Even if I lose a billion dollars, my company won't fall apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp edge in his voice, he added, "Don't think you're the only one with tricks up your sleeve, Queenie. Everyone has it tough in this world. If you push me to the edge, do you think I'll just sit back and let you have your way?" It was clear he wouldn't mind resorting to extreme measures if Queenie left him no other choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt added firmly again, "I've faced tougher battles than you could ever dream of. If you're set on making my life hell, I'll make sure you're crawling like a dog by the end of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the word "dog," Queenie snapped, "Wyatt, you bastard, what nonsense are you spouting? Shut your damn mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt shot back. "Queenie, Steven, the both of you are shameless. Get the hell out of my office!" His heart ached for his son, now sitting in jail, but he wasn't someone to be easily pushed around. Queenie had her schemes, but he was no saint either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, "There's a limit to how much kindness I can show. I played nice before, but do you think I'm still messing around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she raised her phone and shoved it in Wyatt's face. On the screen was a trending topic with the hashtag, "Breaking News--The Farley Group's heir Samuel Farley arrested for murder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similar headlines were plastered all over the internet, followed by countless comments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One netizen wrote: [This is shocking. That spoiled brat Samuel finally got what was coming to him?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another added: [As soon as the news broke, I knew the Farley family deserved this. Hopefully, the truth comes out soon, and justice is served for the victim.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else chimed in: [Murder? That's extreme. Could Samuel be innocent? Waiting for more updates.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another commented: [The Farley Group is in deep trouble now. Imagine the massive impact this will have on the company.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And one more wrote: [I've always thought these rich families were cesspools. Spoiled brats ruining lives for fun&mdash;serves them right.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, but Wyatt also noticed the company's stock was plummeting. His vision blurred for a moment, and he couldn't help but wonder how things had come to this. He gritted his teeth and snapped, "You're despicable, Queenie. Even if I have to drive this company into bankruptcy, I won't let you get your hands on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, unfazed by his confidence, smirked. "Oh, Mr. Wyatt Farley. You don't agree? That's fine. But do you think your shareholders will side with you? I've already spoken to Mr. Foster. He'll be here soon. As the second-largest shareholder after you, he's on board with me. So what makes you think you can stop this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt froze for a moment. It hit him like a ton of bricks&mdash;he'd underestimated Queenie completely. She wasn't just planning to take over his company; she'd already set everything in motion without him noticing. Even Carlo hadn't given him any warning. Wyatt hadn't expected her to team up with Carlo to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's voice turned cold as he said, "I have to admit your methods are impressive. But let me make one thing clear&mdash;you want me dead? I'll make sure you don't walk away alive either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's smile was sharp and unyielding. "Wyatt, I tried to be civil with you earlier, but now you're just barking like a mad dog..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt chuckled darkly, "Calm down, Queenie. You don't think I'd let someone walk all over me without fighting back, do you?" Without missing a beat, he grabbed his phone and dialed Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the line connected, Wyatt barked. "Brian, look into my son's case. Find out if it's true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know my son," Wyatt thought grimly. "If he killed Diana, he would've called me immediately. But Samuel didn't make a single move before getting arrested. Something's not adding up. Diana's murder hasn't even hit the news. If he'd escaped, the first person he'd reach out to would be me. Yet he didn't. There's something fishy going on here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Carlo's booming voice echoed from the doorway. "Mr. Wyatt Farley! What's the deal with your son? Because of him, our company's stock is in freefall. Looks like it's time for you to step down as CEO."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt turned toward the door and saw Carlo. Wyatt's gaze turned icy as he fixed it on him. "Carlo, I never thought you'd be this stupid&mdash;to partner with someone like Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo shot a glance at Queenie, clearly annoyed but also trying to curry favor. His expression turned sly and ingratiating as he said, "Now that's not fair, Queenie. How could you steal my chance to break the news?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="937.html">« Prev</a><a href="939.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
