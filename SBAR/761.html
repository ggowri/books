He turned around and saw Paula, very surprised. Since he moved here, Paula had never come to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Paula was very disappointed in him, and he was also disappointed in himself. He was in a bad mood and poor health, and he didn't want to see anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still missed his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom." Gale's eyes instantly became red. His mother came to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here on such a cold day?" Gale was happy in his heart because his mother was finally willing to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smiled and said, "I came to see you. Do you regret it? Althea is such a good girl, but you hurt her so badly."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula regretted very much that she had not investigated the truth of the matter back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale smiled bitterly, "Mom, I found out the truth later. I regret it very much, but it's too late. Althea doesn't need me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was a loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even until his legs were crippled, he was still willing to believe that Queenie was a good person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought his sister, whom he had doted on for many years, would never hurt him, but he underestimated Queenie's viciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale was very disappointed because his legs were broken by his biological father and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked at him coldly. "You were arrogant and stubborn in the past, Gale. It's your own fault that you became like this today. You dragged Althea in, but you didn't dare to take responsibility. You made Althea move away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gale, if you had taken the responsibility, you wouldn't have left your child without a father.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, Althea is a good girl and her family is well-off. It is not difficult for her to find a man who loves her. I just feel sad for you. You are never willing to take on your responsibilities just like your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was disappointed and painful. Her emotions that had been pent up for a long time were bursting out. She lowered her head and cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Gale was a loser. Althea was a good girl, but Gale didn't deserve her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale was slightly stunned. Thinking that Althea would marry another man, he felt sad. After Penelope's accident, he finally knew Althea's goodness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period of time, he had been recalling the goodness of Althea. As for Penelope, he could hardly remember what that woman looked like.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale lowered his eyes, feeling very sad and difficult to breathe. "Mom, I regret it, but it's too late. Althea doesn't want me anymore. When she gave birth, Diana was with her. Diana didn't tell me about this. Penelope wanted to steal the child and blackmail Althea for money. Then I found out that Althea had given birth to a child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale told Paula what happened on the island, and he knew that he had nothing to do with the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child was Althea's. If he dared to snatch him away, Althea had many ways to make him give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope was so vicious. It was because of Gale's stupidity and arrogance that he caused the consequences today.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula closed her eyes in pain, and her hatred for Queenie deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Queenie was very proud and overjoyed. The matter of the child was solved, and she signed a contract with Zion. The news of their signing also became a trending online.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Paige were sitting together chatting. Seeing Queenie's news, Paige was quite surprised. "Diana, why are bad people so lucky?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="760.html">« Prev</a><a href="762.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
