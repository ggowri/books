I saw you heading upstairs and thought I&#x27;d come check on you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My grandfather&#x27;s back. He wants to meet you. After all the seafood you sent him before, he&#x27;s been wanting to apologize to you in person.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How about tonight?&quot;</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s eyes were fixed solely on Diana, completely ignoring Steven across from her.</p><p>He seemed to effortlessly disregard Steven&#x27;s presence.</p><p>Steven&#x27;s gaze turned dark, his smile cold. </p><p>&quot;Mr. Powell, do you not see anyone else here?&quot;</p><p>Alexander finally cast a fleeting glance at him. </p><p>&quot;Oh! Mr. Gellar, you&#x27;re here too. My apologies, I only have eyes for Diana. I honestly didn&#x27;t notice you.&quot;</p><p>Steven was speechless.</p><p>Steven reminded him, &quot;Mr. Powell, Diana is my wife.&quot;</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s gaze carried an unmistakable possessiveness.</p><p>He couldn&#x27;t wait any longer—he wanted Diana. The uncontrollable emotions in his eyes surged like a relentless tide.</p><p>Alexander let out a cold laugh. &quot;Diana has to acknowledge you for you to be her husband. But she doesn&#x27;t. She told me she&#x27;ll never forgive you.&quot;</p><p>Diana looked at Alexander, puzzled. Had she ever said something like that to him?</p><p>Probably not, right?</p><p>She didn&#x27;t remember ever saying anything like that.</p><p>Steven snapped his gaze to Diana, his voice low and commanding. &quot;Diana, tell him. Who am I?&quot;</p><p>Alexander spoke in a low, gentle tone. &quot;Diana, you once told me you&#x27;d never forgive Steven.&quot;</p><p>Steven&#x27;s hand on his knee suddenly clenched. His piercing gaze rested silently on Diana.</p><p>He knew he had done many things in the past to hurt her.</p><p>If she refused to acknowledge him as her husband, it would break his heart, but he wouldn&#x27;t force her.</p><p>All he wanted was to give her a beautiful life.</p><p>She loved fireworks. During New Year&#x27;s in the past, she&#x27;d buy some and play with them, utterly delighted.</p><p>But what was he doing back then?</p><p>He was consumed by resentment, finding fault with everything. Watching fireworks with her? That was out of the question.</p><p>Now, his heart was no longer the same as back then. When they first met, she took his breath away. Even now, she still does.</p><p>She had endured all the hardships life could throw at her, yet still fought to show him kindness.</p><p>Such tenderness—Steven knew he&#x27;d never experience it a second time in his life.</p><p>Steven suddenly blurted out, &quot;Diana, he likes you. Tell him who I am.&quot;</p><p>Alexander let out a cold laugh, his dark gaze locking onto Steven. He was pressuring Diana.</p><p>&quot;Steven, why are you forcing Diana like this? You&#x27;ve never understood what she truly wants. You&#x27;re dark, lonely. You don&#x27;t know her at all. What right do you have to stand by her side?&quot;</p><p>Diana could feel the tension crackling between them. She abruptly stood up and said, &quot;Alexander, I&#x27;m sorry. Steven is still my husband.&quot;</p><p>Steven let out a sigh of relief, a smile tugging at his lips involuntarily.</p><p>Alexander&#x27;s tall figure staggered back a few steps, visibly shaken.</p><p>He had given her too much freedom, and now she had forgiven that scumbag, Steven.</p><p>A fierce possessiveness flashed in his eyes. &quot;Diana, you promised you&#x27;d get a divorce. I&#x27;ve held back, stayed quiet, and treated you like a friend—only because I was waiting for you to end it. I didn&#x27;t want to burden you with the guilt of an affair.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can&#x27;t give me hope only to crush it, Diana. Look at me. I moved all my business back here—for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because you&#x27;re here in this city. Because I love you. With you, my love has a home, and I finally feel warmth.&quot;</p><p>Diana was deeply shaken. Before she knew about George, she did have hopes for Alexander. But then...</p><p>No matter how much time passed, she still loved Steven.</p><p>She never believed Alexander could have feelings for a married woman like her.</p><p>But his words just now made her cheeks burn with shame.</p><p>&quot;Alexander, I&#x27;m sorry... I never gave you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Diana, I don&#x27;t want to hear your apologies. Let&#x27;s leave it at that for today. See you tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>Alexander turned and walked out of the private room without looking back.</p><p>Diana froze for a moment, her words left unfinished. She wanted to tell Alexander that her heart still belonged to Steven.</p><p>Until her heart was completely free, she wouldn&#x27;t let herself get involved with another man.</p><p>She knew all too well the pain of unrequited love.</p><p>Diana lowered her gaze, guilt filling her eyes.</p><p>Steven stepped beside her, took her hand, and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>&quot;Diana, don&#x27;t be sad. I know you feel guilty about him, and you understand how painful unrequited love can be. You blame yourself. But Diana, if he approached you with ulterior motives from the start, then his feelings were never pure. You don&#x27;t need to waste your sorrow on someone like that.&quot;</p><p>Diana looked up at him, confusion in her eyes. &quot;How do you know his intentions weren&#x27;t pure? How do you know he approached me with a motive?&quot;</p><p>Steven always had a feeling that Alexander wasn&#x27;t as kind as he appeared to be.</p><p>&quot;Diana, he called me dark and lonely. But he&#x27;s the one exiled abroad. Do you think his loneliness is any less than mine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How clean could the methods of a man who ruthlessly took everything from the Powell family really be?&quot;</p><p>Diana didn&#x27;t know how to respond.</p><p>Do men understand other men better?</p><p>Alexander didn&#x27;t give her that impression at all.</p><p>In her heart, Alexander was always there to help whenever she needed him.</p><p>Like the previous collaboration projects, for example.</p><p>&quot;By the way, we worked on a few projects together before. He wasn&#x27;t as bad as you make him sound.&quot;</p><p>Steven lowered his gaze, studying her. Alexander&#x27;s story was similar to his, but they were nothing alike.  </p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re still so naive. Do you really think he&#x27;d show you his darker side?&quot;</p><p>Diana couldn&#x27;t argue, but in her heart, Alexander was a good man.</p><p>Diana sighed. Thinking of Alexander&#x27;s retreating figure, like he was running away, made her heart ache. She never wanted to hurt him.</p><p>&quot;I wanted to use this chance to make things clear with him. Other than working together, I&#x27;ve never given him any reason to hope.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When you hurt me, I ended up working with him again. For a brief moment, I did think—if I divorced you and needed someone else, Alexander might be the one I&#x27;d choose.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#x27;s gentle, always smiling, and, well, he&#x27;s good-looking too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Diana. I am your husband. Divorce is not an option. You can&#x27;t abandon me or our child. In our past life, George destroyed you and our baby. This time, I will make sure both of you stay with me.&quot;</p><p>Steven&#x27;s eyes brimmed with pain as he leaned down and captured her lips in a desperate kiss.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1136.html">« Prev</a><a href="1138.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
