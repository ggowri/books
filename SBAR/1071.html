However, Diana was stunned by his words, feeling a pang in her chest. She just stared blankly at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was truly her prince charming back then. Besides him, she felt she could never fall in love with any other man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past few years, she indeed hadn't met a man who moved her heart more than Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Women can be strange sometimes; things like love at first sight are obviously impossible. After all, who can remember someone for a lifetime just from one glance?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana remembered Steven for a lifetime, becoming one in a million.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Diana fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she was very upset now, so he didn't continue talking about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he couldn't rush. If he could see everything in the dream clearly, he might be able to save the love between him and Diana. In that case, the things in the dream would become their salvation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would complain to him that pain is the beginning of healing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gently said, "Diana, let me go upstairs with you to read. I know you love reading the most. When you stayed home with me before, even though I was blind, every time I called you, I could hear the sound of you putting down your book."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, she was very busy and hardworking. However, he, feeling troubled, didn't notice her efforts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew Diana didn't like those TV dramas but preferred reading books.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "The books in your bookshelf aren't my favorites. I'll just watch TV dramas. I've been using my brain too much lately and can't remember anything I read. I'll watch some dramas and then sleep. I don't want to work tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&#19968;&#21040;&#26202;&#19978;&#65292;&#22905;&#23601;&#24819;&#36538;&#19979;&#12290;&#22905;&#26159;&#20010;&#30561;&#30496;&#29305;&#21035;&#22909;&#30340;&#20154;&#12290;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana put down her phone, turned on the TV, and continued watching the drama she hadn't finished yesterday.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't move but sat beside her, keeping her company while watching TV.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was watching a romance drama on a big TV screen. The female lead was smiling brightly, unaware that the male lead was about to get engaged to another woman. She felt helpless. As she got older, she no longer enjoyed watching such dramas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the female lead found out the male lead was getting engaged. She could no longer smile and ran to the seaside, shouting and screaming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "This female lead is just like me. She's afraid she can't forget the pain, but she's even more afraid she truly forgets it. So, in the end, she holds on while nursing her wounds. But those unspeakable pains will eventually be healed by self-comfort and time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Diana couldn't help but say, "If a man is unfaithful even once, he will never be trusted again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was slightly stunned, his eyes growing darker and darker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After just twenty minutes, Diana felt sleepy. In the end, she fell asleep in Steven's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled. But seeing her sleeping soundly, he let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looks strong but is merely holding on. He lacks a sense of security but forgets that she does too. On the contrary, she sees through his vulnerability and stays by his side to protect him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven whispered, "Diana, from now on, you have me. You can let go of your strong facade. I will be your strongest support."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was in a deep sleep and couldn't hear what Steven said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia walked in and saw this heartwarming scene. She was shocked but didn't think she was mistaken. She thought, "When did their relationship get so close while I was away? Diana can even sleep peacefully in Steven's arms now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After glancing out the window, Olivia noticed it was cloudy today and thought, "No wonder Diana is sleepy. On rainy days, she can sleep from night till the next evening."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gestured for her to stay quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia suddenly felt it wasn't the right time for her to be there. She pointed toward the door and then turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Forget it, I'll give them a chance to breathe. No matter how many times they part, they will end up together. It's their destiny."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t stop her because he truly didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want anyone disturbing them at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana woke up again, it was already the next day. The moment she opened her eyes, she saw Steven's handsome face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of daze, Diana thought, "I actually fell asleep while watching TV yesterday and even slept until the next morning. It seems I've been really exhausted lately, giving Steven the perfect chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Steven's sleeping face, Diana felt he was still as handsome as ever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lay quietly on his side on the pillow, as if time had silently stopped for his sleeping face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's thick, slightly curled eyelashes cast a faint shadow on his handsome cheeks. With his steady breathing, they occasionally fluttered gently, like butterflies about to take flight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His high, straight nose outlined a perfect profile in the interplay of light and shadow. His lips were beautiful, seemingly soft to kiss. The fine strands of his hair casually fell across his forehead, adding a touch of laziness and ease to his usual aloofness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blushed, thinking, "He really is so handsome. No wonder I loved him so deeply back then. The determination I had to save him at all costs was truly worth it. Of course, I mean his looks, not him as a person."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, have you seen enough?" Diana's voice, full of amusement, slowly echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze for a moment before realizing that one of her feet was still resting on Steven's waist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew she was very restless when sleeping. So, she figured she must have treated Steven as a free pillow last night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana responded, "I'm awake. Are you awake too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Diana quietly moved her foot down from Steven's waist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven's hand suddenly grabbed her calf.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their eyes met, Diana's eyes widened, while Steven smiled meaningfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana tried gently, but still couldn't pull her leg away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cheeks turned red, and she said angrily, "Let go of my foot right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven slowly sat up and gently put her leg down. "Diana, you can rest your leg on my waist when you sleep from now on. You'll sleep better that way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt ashamed because her sleeping habits were really bad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry." Then, Diana stopped apologizing and instead glared at him angrily. "I fell asleep on the couch last night. Why are you suddenly sleeping in my bed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t explain anything. Instead, he picked up his phone, opened a video, and showed it to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the video, Steven was carrying Diana upstairs with a limp, then gently placed her on the bed. Immediately, she held his hand and said, "Don't go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The video was taken by Steven, so it only showed Diana. However, she really did grab Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he shamelessly lay down beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana calmly closed her eyes, then doubted herself, thinking, "So this is the kind of person I am."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1070.html">« Prev</a><a href="1072.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
