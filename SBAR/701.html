That's what she said."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly lost the confidence to talk about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna could tell that Diana had become vulnerable again because of her love for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be sad. Since you've already decided to give up on Mr. Gellar, it doesn't matter who is carrying his child, does it?" Luna said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was a little indifferent to everything and was not good at consoling people.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana still felt very down and couldn't muster any energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, even so, I still feel quite sad."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt like weeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, do you know? Even though I've let go, my heart still aches uncontrollably," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It puzzled Diana as she asked, "Why are you sighing? You are too young to do that."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was speechless. "Diana, I've already grown up."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, keep an eye on things online at all times, and let me know immediately if there's any movement. I'm at work," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales this season were so good that it filled her with enthusiasm, and she immediately put away her negative feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a glimmer of light in her beautiful eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna smiled and said, "Okay, I'll keep an eye on Queenie. I'll let you know right away if there's any movement. Don't be so out of it anymore, focus on making money."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana still felt a vague sense of unease deep down, as the Foliot family would target her because of what happened to Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea when they would deal with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The misdeeds done by Queenie and Amelie were left for her to bear the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, holding the trump card tightly in her hand, she was not afraid of the incoming mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just reluctant to get innocent people involved when those villains framed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pressed her lips together, thinking of the slanders online, and murmured coldly to herself, "What will they do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about?" A deep, pleasant voice came from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana suddenly raised her head, gazing at Steven's handsome face. His expression remained cool and indifferent, and under the light, his features became even more stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said angrily, "Don't you know how to knock before entering? And why don't you make any sound when you walk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her in confusion. "I did knock. I only came in after knocking. As for why you didn't hear me walking, it's because there's carpet on the floor."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His slightly downcast eyes made him appear very dignified, as if he were smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he came in, he did indeed knock, but she was so lost in thought that she didn't hear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed the warm milk on her desk. "Have some milk. You should take a short break."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a bit surprised; this was the second time Steven had brought her warm milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" She didn't dare to drink it and pressed her lips with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew what she was thinking. "Don't worry, I didn't poison it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of unease flashed across Diana's face, surprised that he knew what she was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm afraid you might have poisoned it. After all, Queenie is carrying your child; you might want to marry her and get rid of me," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, very displeased, "Haven't you been following the news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat on Diana's bed, and the faint fragrance aroused his desire for her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="700.html">« Prev</a><a href="702.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
