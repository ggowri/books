Just running your mouth? The evidence is right in front of you. Do you think wasting time is going to change that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana cast her an unimpressed look, her tone lazy, almost amused. "Oh, so I should take a page from your book and start playing dirty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where the hell was Steve? Diana was waiting for him to make a move. Once he did, she'd make sure Queenie got exactly what was coming to her. This woman never stopped scheming. No matter where she went, she was always plotting against someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, her voice laced with mockery. "And do you have any proof that I'm the mastermind behind all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gestured toward Cecil. "Do I really need to spell it out? You&mdash;you're the only one here who looks human but does things even a rabid dog would think twice about. And what's your next move? You gonna try and kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's jaw tightened, her anger simmering beneath the surface. She wanted to rip Diana apart, but in front of so many people, she had to keep her cool. She leaned in, lowering her voice to a venomous whisper. "Diana, you really think I wouldn't get my hands dirty for this? There's no one in this world I hate more than you. Killing you is just a matter of when.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make sure you end up just like last time&mdash;shattered, broken, never even getting the chance to see your own child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, Diana, didn't that destroy you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watching your baby die, completely helpless? That pain? That agony? I'm going to make you feel it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down Diana's spine, her body stiffening as Queenie's words clawed their way into her head. Her grip on the wheelchair's armrest tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her past life came crashing back&mdash;pain, blood, the overwhelming scent of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory alone was enough to make her feel like her whole body was being torn apart all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie watched the color drain from Diana's face, satisfaction flickering in her eyes. That's more like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Diana's gaze sharpened, her expression turning ice-cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment of weakness vanished as quickly as it came. She met Queenie's smug look head-on, completely unshaken. Diana knew exactly what kind of person Queenie was&mdash;ruthless, cruel, willing to do anything to get what she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, she was even more unhinged than in their last life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this time, everything was slipping through her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything she once had now belonged to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their paths had only crossed because Jeff had switched them at birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their goals were different. Their desires were different. Their very existence was a threat to each other. And now, they were locked in a battle neither of them could afford to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wanted power. And she was willing to claw her way to the top by any means necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's chest tightened, an old, buried fear creeping up on her. The fear from her past life still lurked in the corners of her mind, whispering, waiting for her to slip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before it could take hold, Luna burst onto the scene, breathless, looking like she'd sprinted the entire way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, snapping out of her daze. Whatever ghosts from the past were haunting her could wait. Right now, she had a problem to solve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She noticed something&mdash;Queenie's right-hand man, Mario, was missing. He had left earlier and hadn't returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that Luna was here, the truth wouldn't be far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, where have you been?" Diana asked, her voice even.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna shot a wary glance at Queenie before turning back to Diana. "Diana, someone locked me in a room. I had to break the lock to get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression didn't change, but a slow realization settled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So that was why Luna had taken so long. Someone had caught on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't say anything, letting Luna catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the second antidote was finally kicking in. Cecil was coming back to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was still a mess&mdash;his stomach felt like it was being twisted inside out, his head was pounding, and his whole body burned like he was running a fever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He braced himself against the table, trying to keep himself upright. His blurred vision landed on the police, then on Lillian. And then he moved. In one swift motion, he strode toward Lillian and raised his hand. Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap rang out through the room like a gunshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd went dead silent. No one had expected Cecil to do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared, stunned. Had he just hit her? In public?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie snapped, "Cecil, are you really going to pick on someone helpless in front of all these people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil gritted his teeth against the pain in his gut and shot back, "Queenie, and you're so sure she's helpless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie arched a brow. "And you're so sure she isn't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! I called everyone here to expose you for the snake you are, but looks like I walked right into your trap instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was seething. At this point, he had to admit&mdash;Queenie played dirtier than he ever could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no boundaries, no lines she wouldn't cross. He did. And that made all the difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smirked. She had known from the start that this party invite was just a setup. Cecil wanted to ruin her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad for him&mdash;she beat him to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or did she...?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze locked onto Diana, scrutinizing every detail of her expression. Just how far had her medical skills come?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clenched her jaw, her voice sharp. "Diana, just how good are you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met her glare with an easy smile. "Why don't you take a guess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hated that answer. Hated that, even now, she had no idea just how much she didn't know about Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wanted George at the top of the Gellar Group, Diana was the one obstacle in her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all these years of trying, she still hadn't been able to take her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now? Now, eliminating her was even harder. There was only one way left&mdash;poison her, let it look natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Diana could cure Cecil, could she really be poisoned so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie let out a quiet, mirthless chuckle. No poison worked if the target saw it coming. But if she struck before Diana even realized&mdash; Well, then it'd be a whole different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was going down, she'd make damn sure Diana went with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Lillian, still dazed from the blow, finally snapped back to reality. Her eyes flared with fury as she turned on Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Farley, you think you can humiliate me forever, huh? In front of everyone, you actually had the guts to hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her whole body was trembling with rage. He was supposed to be under her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How? How had he broken free so fast?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poison, the hypnosis, the incense&mdash;it was all designed to make him completely susceptible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil let out a cold laugh. "You waltzed into my room with some sweet-smelling perfume, barely five minutes in and my head was spinning. Next thing I know, you're stark naked, screaming that I forced you. And you call me the predator? Please. You threw yourself at me and expected me to play along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's breath hitched. She had nothing to say to that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp, clear gaze bore into her. He was fully awake now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, she lifted her hand and gave the little bell on her wrist the faintest shake. The chime was barely audible, but anyone affected by the incense would hear it loud and clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second the sound hit Cecil's ears, his head felt like it was being split in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh&mdash;" He winced, his fingers digging into his temples. He turned blindly toward Diana. "Diana, my head... it's killing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression darkened as her gaze flicked toward Lillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her voice softened as she reassured Cecil, "Don't panic. The incense you inhaled&mdash;Celestia Draught&mdash;messes with your neural pathways and causes extreme pain. But you took the antidote. Just hold on, it'll pass."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the name left Diana's lips, Lillian's face went slack. She stared at Diana in disbelief. That incense was a closely guarded secret of the Zephara Region, known only in the deepest circles. How the hell did Diana know about it?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1025.html">« Prev</a><a href="1027.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
