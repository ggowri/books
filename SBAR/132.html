Is it so glorious to spend your lover's money? How about I do a live broadcast for you so that everyone can see how arrogant you are as a mistress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You..." Queenie stomped her feet in anger. Why was Diana becoming more and more eloquent?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, I think you are just jealous of me." She smiled arrogantly and proudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven, that idiot, would give her pocket money as long as she said sweet words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, go ahead. I'll watch you here and see how shameless you are."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie smiled proudly. "Penelope, you are pregnant with the Marsh family's child. These clothes are my gifts to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at the salesperson with a proud smile. "I'll take one in a large of each style you have here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the salesperson heard this, she smiled very happily. "Okay, wait a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia supported Diana and sat aside to watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia smiled and asked, "This is your man's money..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey... Olivia, don't talk nonsense, he is Queenie's man, not mine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In this life, I will not be with Steven again. When I loved him, I tried my best. When I leave him, I will forget him completely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would never be with Steven in this life. She had said this countless times, but Olivia never believed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia looked at her deeply and said, "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana whispered, "Olivia, this isn't the first time I've told you this, why don't you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia looked at her and said, "Because you did stupid things before. Thinking about the stupid things you have done in the past few years, I feel sorry for you. Can't you just love yourself well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was angry with herself when she thought about the stupid things she had done in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She whispered, "Not again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two chatted for a long time, and Queenie and Penelope finally finished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The clothes in this shop were not cheap. All the clothes added up cost nearly five million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at Diana, smiling proudly and saying, "Diana, watch this, I spent five million dollars at one time, and Steven didn't even blink an eye. This is how much he loves me. This is an honor you will never get in your lifetime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie handed the card to the salesperson with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She spent so much of Steven's money, that she thought Diana should go to Steven to make trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't want to become a mistress, so she could only ask Steven to divorce so that he could be with her legitimately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope excitedly took Queenie's hand and said, "Queenie, thank you for being so nice to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was still brooding over what Diana had said just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now seeing Queenie being so generous and spending five million dollars, she no longer had any thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could return some of these clothes and keep some to wear, and she could get several million dollars back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie patted her hands and smiled kindly, saying, "Penelope, you are pregnant with my eldest brother's child. My eldest brother loves you so much, even if I don't buy it for you, he will buy it for you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Unlike some people who were kicked out and had to live on the streets, staying with dubious men for money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie said this to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia suddenly raised her eyes and looked at her. "Queenie, if you don't know how to speak, just shut up. Being a mistress, how dare you say such things? Don't you know what's going on? How dare you talk nonsense here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at Olivia with cold eyes. Could it be Olivia also knew something?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you're indeed as bad as your friend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is Harry a good man? If everyone knew that the eldest daughter of the Marsh family has a very good relationship with the kidnapper Harry, would those women who have been insulted by Harry let you off easily?" Diana said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie choked. Diana was becoming more and more difficult to deal with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hmph!" She snorted coldly and saw the salesperson walking up to Queenie with a gloomy face. "Sorry, there is no money in your card. Can you confirm again, did you took the wrong card?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie frowned and said, "No money? Is your card machine broken?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could her card have no money? Steven gave her this card, which had no limit on the amount.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But what she didn't know was the tall figure of Steven standing not far away, looking at her with gloomy eyes.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="131.html">« Prev</a><a href="133.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
