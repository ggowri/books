Steven was not like the two feeble fools she had encountered earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was robust, a testament to his daily regimen of exercise. The taut muscles of his abdomen spoke of his solid physique. The disparity in their strength was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you move aside," Diana muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven heard the tremor in her tone, a clear indication of the tumultuous path their relationship had taken.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed a gentle kiss to her lips and wrapped her in a tender embrace. Her head found its place on his shoulder. The violent thumping of their hearts was a shared rhythm between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips brushed against her ear as he whispered, "Diana, if you don't want me to, I won't force you. But I will reclaim every ounce of suffering you've endured. I need time, and after this period, I will reveal the truth to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was for her to stay by his side, compliant and loving. He wanted to be with her forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice, laden with an alluring texture, seemed to carry unspoken emotions. Each word, a spellbinding whisper, quickened Diana's heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, amidst the chaos of her thoughts, a clarity emerged. "What truth?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was aware of the many facets of Steven that remained unknown to her, and she also had no desire to uncover. His influence was growing, and she recognized her own limitations in the face of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Steven also commanded a formidable organization in the shadows. She had overheard him discussing it during those dark days when she was his prisoner in a past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she was engulfed in confusion. Why would Steven share such secrets with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gazed into her curious eyes. She was undeniably beautiful, but there was something about the way her eyes suddenly widened in surprise that struck him as incredibly cute, momentarily fueling his lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached for her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant their fingers intertwined, skin meeting skin, an electric current surged through them, causing both to tremble at the unexpected spark.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks turned a deep shade of crimson, yet her eyes betrayed a tumult of emotions within her heart. How profound were her feelings for him so that his gentle provocations awakened her lust?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was enthralled by her scent, a fragrance that ensnared him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, grant me some time. You've been with me for two years; you know well the malevolence of the Gellar family. I will let you in on the truth, but not now. It would do you no good to know it yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were abyssal, a depth that seemed to hold untold secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was under no illusion about the peril of being close to him, so she wisely kept their relationship veiled from the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps even Cecil struggled to comprehend why she hadn't exposed Steven and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a vampire, something would meet its end with the first rays of dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana grasped its meaning instantly and pushed him away. "Move aside, you're too heavy," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had eaten so much that when he leaned against her, it felt uncomfortable for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't budge. Instead, he pressed closer, their bodies fitting together seamlessly, without the slightest gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, deep and fervent, seemed to devour her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt his heavy breath and the heat of his body. As a doctor, she was acutely aware of where this could lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven seized the moment. "I'll stay the night. If another villain comes knocking, you won't stand a chance against them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, unwilling and desiring no shared quarters with him, retorted, "I'm not afraid. Leave me be; I don't wish to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rejection was clear; the most dangerous person for Diana was Steven himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze dimmed, and he slowly sat up. "If there's a knock on the door in the dead of night, remember to call for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Acknowledging her exhaustion after a day of activities, he chose not to disturb her further.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sighed in relief as he stepped away, truly leaving her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rose, securing the door before retreating to shower and rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven returned to the adjacent room, his steps heavy with unspoken thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sank into the sofa and folded his long legs in an elegant posture, but his eyes were deep and inscrutable.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="776.html">« Prev</a><a href="778.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
