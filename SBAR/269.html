He fixed Diana with a mocking gaze. "Diana, you hail from the countryside, yet this office is quite the sight. After you latched onto Mr. Watson, you've become quite the respectable figure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's so wrong with coming from the countryside? Frankly, we were all farmers. You look down on farmers, yet you eat vegetables. You think you're some high and mighty city dweller, so why don't you eat cement bricks instead of the vegetables farmers grow?" Diana shot back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her distaste for his arrogant attitude was palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words left Frank struggling for air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He narrowed his eyes at her, coldly assessing. In truth, if Diana weren't so malicious, he might have appreciated having such a beautiful sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the siblings, they resembled each other the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana bore no likeness to their father, none at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, it's all your fault. You've brought nothing but turmoil to our family. You shouldn't have come back. Queenie will always be our little princess. You're nothing," Frank spat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His anger surged as he recalled Paula's demand from the night before to exile him. He laid all the blame squarely on Diana's shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sharp pain pierced Diana's heart. She smiled bitterly, "Yes, I find it repulsive to share the same blood with you. It's utterly helpless for me, being siblings with such despicable creatures like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you're the malicious one, yet you call me vile? I'm ashamed to be your brother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's thoughts turned to how Queenie could have married Steven long ago if not for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, I've severed ties with your family. Why do your people keep coming after me?" Diana asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was exasperated and thought, "Forget it! Why bother with a man who was doomed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's anger flared at her helpless expression. "If you want to leave, then leave for good. Don't hang around disturbing my family and our lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for you, Steven and Queenie would have been happy together long ago. It's all because of you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because of me? Frank, your brain is full of crap. When they were old enough to marry, it was Queenie who ran off after Steven's accident, yet you pin it all on me. Don't forget, you were the one who pushed me into the spotlight first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bastards, why do you think what you do is right? Why should I be the one constantly bullied?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was taken aback by her words. A moment of clarity broke through his anger. "But we told you when you got married that Steven belonged to Queenie. If she came back, you had to divorce him. It was you who refused..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already signed a divorce agreement and a letter of severance with your family. Stay as far away from me as possible and never show your face in front of me again." Diana calmly announced, and her eyes were devoid of warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why was she wasting her breath on a dead man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank choked on his anger, shouting, "Then why haven't you finalized the divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Steven who doesn't want to go through with it. Instead of coming here to humiliate me, why don't you persuade Steven to finalize the divorce formalities with me? I can't do it alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted nothing more to do with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was convinced that she was lying. "Diana, you're the one who doesn't want the divorce. Why are you blaming Steven?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She yelled, "Get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, your life is in shambles. What else are you capable of other than hitting on men at every turn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His anger boiled over at her audacity to dismiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out! ! You're a dying man; I won't waste my time on you." Diana said, settling back into her chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His anger surged. "Diana, are you cursing me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "You don't need me to curse you. Elsie is your death warrant. Congratulations on your upcoming marriage, by the way. That's just great. Congratulations!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her peculiar smile only stoked his fury further. "Just you wait, Diana. I'm going to wreck your reputation. I'll make last night's scandal a hundred, no, a thousand times worse. You'll become an outcast, someone everyone despises."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew what he was planning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's fine. You're almost dead anyway; do whatever you want to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You!" Frank stormed out in a fit of rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana leaned back. The pain in her heart was so intense that it felt like she couldn't breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She closed her eyes, seeking solace in the darkness, unaware of anyone approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she was yanked into someone's embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes flew open in shock to meet a pair of scarlet eyes. She was startled.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="268.html">« Prev</a><a href="270.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
