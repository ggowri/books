The cold wind is piercing and the wind was howling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quietly looked at the sea in the distance and understood that if one made the wrong decision, he would have a lot to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale's expression was serious. Once he woke up, he didn't even have the courage to face what he had done in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head and looked at his crippled legs. Diana had advised him, but he was stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale believed that vicious woman, Queenie. And even after hearing the truth, he was unwilling to believe that Queenie would attack him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Frank was missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric worked as a driver for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was stubborn. And his personality was very similar to Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their parents divorced. Dylan always felt it was Paula's fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't been abroad and it hadn't snowed heavily recently so he couldn't come back, he would have caused a fuss a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale suddenly realized why his grandfather didn't want to see them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no knowledge. Their grandfather was disappointed in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale deeply realized how important the growing environment was in this family. Jeff only wanted to ruin them. The ideas he put in their heads were terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, the nurse behind Gale, saw Gale's frustration and advised him, "Gale, open a hotel nearby and stay there first. You can always see your child if you want to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you need to do now is to try to stand up. It's okay to take the wrong path. If you're willing to start over, it's not too late. You're still young."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale was slightly startled. He looked at Kyle and said sadly, "Kyle, I once even wanted to destroy my biological sister for the sake of an adopted sister. Am I a very vicious person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle frowned with disgust. "Yes. It's vicious. This is the most horrible and vicious thing I have ever heard of. Young people act impulsively. You even wanted to ruin someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no right to do so. You feel good about it and happy about it, but what is the most terrible outcome for the girl? Suicide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle was excited. "My daughter was bullied and then committed suicide. The murderer has not been found yet. Rich people only do things for their own pleasure. There is no point in regret. The people you hurt will not forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your sister is the beautiful girl standing inside just now?" Kyle asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale nodded. "Yes. She is very beautiful and looks a lot like my mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle nodded and said earnestly, "Yes. She is also a blessed girl. In your life, you should never dream of having a sister again. She will not forgive you. But you still have to cheer up and live a good life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My wife and I have been in a lot of pain since my daughter died. Although we still have a younger daughter, the pain of losing our eldest daughter will be a lifelong pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But life still has to go on. I don't have any ability and can't give my daughter a better life, so she was bullied. Sometimes, incompetent parents are also a harm to their children. My daughter was verbally humiliated and bullied by her classmates because my family was not well off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, she couldn't stand it and jumped off the building."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We don't know much about her situation. She was very well behaved when she came home. When talked about her school life, she said everything was fine. How could such a well-behaved girl commit suicide? I still can't figure it out."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="578.html">« Prev</a><a href="580.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
