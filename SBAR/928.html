He said, "The last time we tried to trap Felicity, she managed to avoid it quickly. That means they have some powerful people on their side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before the authorities arrive, they resolved all tax-related matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, Queenie has been hiding something from us. She's a hacker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this time, we must be very cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go call Jace and tell him that Felicity is Queenie's person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything from now on would slowly take Queenie and George's lives, piece by piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was shocked that Queenie was a hacker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Mr. Gellar. I'll make the call right now. Jace is still in the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes turned cold, his tone mocking. "He's just tying his own noose. The Foliot family was never a good bunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go handle this first. Get it done right. The Foliot family has been in the business world for many years and has plenty of connections. Queenie's scheming against Jace </span><span>won't go unnoticed. He won't let her off so easily. Next, we'll use others to take her down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at his own legs. There was nothing too serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just some soft tissue injuries from falling into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worst injury was his chest. His ribs were cracked, making it hard to stand or walk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Diana's medicine, he had felt much better these past few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan left to deal with the Foliot family situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat before the computer, watching Diana eat dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was with familiar people, her nature was straightforward, and she ate with abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore disposable gloves as she ate crab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting next to her, Joseph occasionally looked at her with a smile, his gaze tender. Steven could tell right away that Joseph liked Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eighteen-year-old boy, full of passion and youth, his love as fiery as a blazing flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's chest tightened with discomfort, a deep, unbearable feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was beautiful. But he despised all the men around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph, Alexander, and Cecil all had other intentions toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, in no more than three months, I will be back by your side," Steven whispered to himself, looking down at the certificate in his hand and smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hospital, Jace had regained his strength. The ventilator was taken off, and he looked at his younger son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eldest son had already been arrested and thrown into jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The younger son, Liam, sat slumped beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace angrily glared at him. "Look at the stupid things your brother did! He's a public figure. How could he be photographed and then exposed by his own wife?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now the company is ruined. What are you going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam looked extremely grim, his eyes flashing with murderous intent. "It was Queenie. She's the one who helped him find that woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze toward his father. "Dad, you got infected. Queenie deliberately arranged for a sick woman to get close to you. From the start, her intentions weren't pure. As soon as you fell, the family was doomed. That's why she targeted you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was seething, ready to kill Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's face darkened. He had lived a life of indulgence, but now he had fallen into the hands of a woman like Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been charmed by her sweet words and had given her a lot of resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only later did he realize she had climbed her way up to Zion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman who would even calculate against the woman who had raised her for over twenty years was not a good person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, he had just seen Queenie as a smart woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her tactics had been used on him, and they were cruel beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's phone rang, and Liam quickly handed it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you got a phone call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace knew it was another shareholder from the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He groaned in frustration, pinching his brow. "You answer it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam answered the call, "Hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Foliot, I'm calling to inform you that the person currently acquiring your company is Felicity from Queenie's company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was stunned, but the man hung up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked. He didn't expect that she had company behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was left in shock. The seemingly innocent woman, who looked like a delicate flower, had a whole company behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, the person acquiring our company is Queenie's person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Jace tensed up, his murky eyes filled with murderous rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For so many years, both in the legitimate and underground worlds, he had connections, and he had never suffered such humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been infected with a disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie!" He growled through clenched yellowed teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get our people to teach Queenie a lesson. Steven is with her now, but everything Steven has, he gave to that woman, Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie has no backup without Steven. It will be easy to take her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throw Felicity out and go find Paige. She will help us keep the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam, hearing his father's words, finally had a sense of purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I'll take care of this right away. You focus on your treatment. The doctor said it's treatable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Jace nodded, urging him to go quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up his phone and saw that the Foliot family stock had hit the limit-down price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in his eyes. This was his life's work. The Foliot Media Company had an unshakable position in Capitole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to his hasty decisions, the Foliot family had been set back ten years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regretted it terribly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George had returned to her apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat before the computer, watching as the Foliot family stock had hit the limit-down price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was delighted. "Great! Felicity has already acquired many shares from the shareholders, and she's taken control of six subsidiaries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George kissed her on the cheek, his voice gentle. "Queenie, you're the best. You confused that old man so thoroughly. He didn't know which way was up. In the end, you struck the fatal blow. Now, his eldest son's in jail, and his youngest son is useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His nephews are also incapable, and Mark is charmed by your mother. Soon, the entire Foliot family will be ours. My people are also acquiring shares from other shareholders. We'll split the entire Foliot family between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie leaned against him, gazing up at him, her eyes full of love. "George, now that the Foliot family is taken care of, the next target is Diana!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled strangely, kissing her on the red lips before replying, "Don't worry, </span><span>Samuel is already on his way. As for Diana, this Christmas, I won't let her have a peaceful life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was pleased. If Diana wasn't happy, she would be happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a hint of worry appeared on her face. "But we need to leave here soon. Jace seems to be involved in both the legitimate and underground worlds. Now that the company's in trouble, I'm afraid he'll go desperate and turn on us."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="927.html">« Prev</a><a href="929.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
