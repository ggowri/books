Steven's imposing aura was quite overwhelming, putting a lot of pressure on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While waiting at the police station to see Cecil, Diana suddenly remembered something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, once both parties sign a divorce agreement, you can get a divorce. I remember there's no time limit. As the party leaving with nothing, there's no property entanglement. Once I have the divorce agreement, I can file for divorce at the court, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly thought of a way to get a divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna said, "Ms. Bishop, what are you thinking? Both parties need to be present for a divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana grinned slyly, "I have a plan. Once I get the divorce agreement, I can find someone to represent Steven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought to herself with delight, "Why didn't I think of such a simple question before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna just wanted to say that no one would dare to be Steven's representative.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven, outside the door, was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan couldn't help but chuckle, thinking, "Ms. Bishop, in her quest for divorce, is even considering stealing the agreement. It seems she really doesn't want to be with Mr. Gellar anymore. Poor Mr. Gellar, abandoned again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, it's settled. Once we're back, I'll find a way to get the divorce agreement out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's eyes were filled with laughter. She suddenly felt a weight lifted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna's mouth twitched. "Ms. Bishop, I heard Steven offered you a divorce agreement countless times before. Why didn't you sign it back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A flash of pain crossed Diana's eyes. She sighed, "I was too kind-hearted back then. I thought he was too lonely. Besides Evan, no one around him genuinely cared for him. I wanted to be there for him, to live with him. I thought one day he would see through the Marsh family's true faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But in Steven's heart, Queenie was perfect. They grew up together. How could I ever compete with her? I overestimated myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She continued, "The last time, Queenie falsely accused me of kidnapping her. I was slapped by him and knocked unconscious. When I went to train, I was deaf in one ear. It took a month of treatment to recover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yet, even when he saw the truth, he still didn't believe me. He left me again for Queenie to be reviled by everyone. Luna, even the deepest love would be worn away by such indifference. Steven left me over and over for Queenie. That time, it completely extinguished the last bit of love I had for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna looked at her with sympathy. "Ms. Bishop..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, let's not talk about it. It would be embarrassing if they come in and hear us," Diana interrupted Luna with a smile. She knew what Luna was about to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stopped in his tracks. So, she didn't agree to the divorce before because she loved and cared for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wasn't clinging to his status and wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was the one who really cared for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stood at the door, not going in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan didn't dare to breathe heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was so fortunate to have earned Diana's trust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They stood at the door the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn't until they saw Diana and Luna go to see Cecil that they went in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan looked at Steven's upright back. He hadn't wanted to come. Now, he finally understood why Steven had come personally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Cecil was in trouble, Diana would definitely come to help. That was why Steven came, and he indeed ran into Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil was surprised to see Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sat casually on the chair, like a guest here. He said with a smile, "Diana, I didn't expect it would be you who came."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="176.html">« Prev</a><a href="178.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
