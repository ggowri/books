"No, Luna, it's just a minor fracture in my calf. I'll be fine after a few days of rest. You should get some sleep. You have a lot more to handle than I do. Get a few trusted bodyguards to stay close to you. We have a tough battle ahead, especially tomorrow morning. Arrange for twenty bodyguards to be on-site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are bound to be Queenie's people at the company, so we need to take this chance to clean house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And make sure Nolan mobilizes everyone to search for Steven. He's still alive. We have to find him and Evan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna understood the urgency and felt a knot of worry for Evan. "Alright, Diana. I'll grab the toothpaste for you, and I'll take care of everything else. Just focus on healing. I've already started making arrangements for the Gellar Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's well-being was crucial to Luna's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna prepared a warm bath for Diana and squeezed out some toothpaste before heading out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana added a few drops of rose essential oil to the bathwater before easing herself in, propping her injured foot on the edge of the tub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't soak for long. Ten minutes later, Diana climbed out, got dressed, and washed her hair. By the time she finished drying her hair and applying her skincare, an hour had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling open the bathroom door, she gazed into her cold bedroom, and a swirl of complex emotions washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truths she had uncovered today weighed heavily on her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana settled into her wheelchair and maneuvered to the soft and inviting bed. Choosing to stay here was a strategic move. Queenie wouldn't suspect this place, and for now, she was safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, if Steven was still alive, he would surely come here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she lay in bed, the usually quick-to-sleep Diana found herself wide awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out her phone and scrolled through the photos and videos Queenie had sent her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The images showed a man holding Queenie, and their intimacy was striking. Yet his expressions were mirrored Steven's so closely that she couldn't believe they weren't the same person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't have a twin brother or an older sibling. His mother had only given birth to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why do they look so alike? Even their expressions are identical. Is that man some kind of replicant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, that's impossible. The man beside Queenie is real. It can't be that simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't paid close attention to their tones, I wouldn't have realized that today's man is a fake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought back to the divorce certificate she had seen earlier and sighed. Regardless of everything, she and Steven were truly divorced now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It surprised her that Steven was willing to give her everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being a little wealthy made her smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't want it all. A little money for comfort was enough. When Steven returned, she would return everything to him. She couldn't bear such a windfall. And she could earn her own money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life and the last, she didn't want to owe Steven anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her mind racing, Diana finally drifted off to sleep, though the lights in her room remained on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the villa, in a luxurious SUV, the heating was cranked up, making it cozy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and Evan sat in the car. Steven was seriously injured. When the car was pushed into the sea, he sustained even more damage on top of his existing wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he leaned weakly against the seat, and his gaze was fixed on the light in Diana's room, bringing him a faint sense of belonging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every part of him ached, and he thought, if only he were next to Diana, she wouldn't let him suffer like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan turned to him, and concern etched on his face. "Mr. Gellar, we should head back and get some rest. You need to heal before you can help Mrs. Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were bloodshot, and his head was swollen, a painful reminder of his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regretted not acting sooner, allowing Queenie and George to take advantage of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thankfully, there was still time to set things right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom how Andrew had managed to bring back a wild card that looked exactly like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thing was clear. His mother had only given birth to him, so there couldn't possibly be a twin brother or an older sibling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet George's every move and his gaze were mirrored Steven's so closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no wonder Diana had struggled to tell them apart in those photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had never been intimated with Queenie, and seeing those images had shocked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been involved with her, he might not have been able to discern the truth behind the photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Evan, Steven asked, "Is everything set for tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan observed Steven's frail state and replied, "It's all arranged, Mr. Gellar. You need to take this medication. I got some hemostatic and anti-inflammatory drugs from Mrs. Gellar's medical kit, along with some painkillers. They work wonders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven couldn't go to the hospital, and he had to rely on Diana's supplies instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized them well and knew their effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low and steady. "Alright. Let's head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven cast a lingering glance at Diana's room, knowing she had discovered the truth that the man in Queenie's bed wasn't him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of hearing that phrase while still conscious pierced his heart every time he thought about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan handed him the medication, and they drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His phone buzzed. It was Luna, that cool yet adorable girl. But he couldn't let her get involved in this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Luna knew where he was, she wouldn't be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they weathered this storm, Evan would definitely bring her home and make her his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled at the thought. He was injured, too. His face was marked with cuts. When he realized Steven had been swapped out, he followed the group with four others, and together, they had pulled the recently operated-on Steven from the icy depths of the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Steven was truly fighting against the odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As dawn broke, Diana woke early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of going back to sleep, she got up to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She maneuvered her wheelchair into the bathroom, and half an hour later, she emerged, dressed in a sleek black business suit topped with a matching coat. Looking in the mirror, Diana admired her polished reflection, a look of determination crossing her face as she smiled slightly before wheeling out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana entered the elevator, a notification pinged on her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mrs. Gellar, hello! I'm Dalton Dent, an executive at headquarters. Please accept my friend request.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze at the sight of the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The title "Mrs. Gellar" made her question the legitimacy of her divorce from Steven just the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have the divorce certificate right here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It has to be real, doesn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed too easy to obtain yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seal looks genuine. They wouldn't joke about something like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there could be other possibilities..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana accepted his friend request. She knew Dalton had been with Steven for years and would never betray him, so she felt comfortable moving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly messaged Dalton: [[Mr. Dent, please notify all executives, department managers, and branch offices that I will be conducting today's meeting via video and at the office.]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="909.html">« Prev</a><a href="911.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
