She hung up immediately and blocked the number, thinking to herself that she would never forgive her. After that, she closed her eyes and quickly fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Paula's meager display of motherly love, Diana no longer sought it, nor did she need it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the company, Paula sat on the floor in tears after seeing that Diana had hung up on her. Her mind replayed all the cruel things she had said to her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula realized that she wasn't worthy of being Diana's mother. She had been ashamed of Diana and even feared that she would embarrass her. Now, with the relationship between mother and daughter in such a state, Paula was truly in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had finished dinner but didn't leave. Instead, he cleared the table, took the dishes to the kitchen, and washed his hands before heading upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had seen Diana go to the second floor. He pushed open the door to her room. It was large and minimalistic, with only a bed and a sofa, and lacked any decoration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how deeply she was sleeping, Steven walked in quietly, taking in her pale face. Her features were delicate and bore a striking resemblance to Paula, though not to Jeff. Her facial structure was more defined and refined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat by Diana's side for a while before finally standing up. The design of the villa was intricate and unique. He quietly opened the door and noticed the room next door was labeled as the walk-in closet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door, a perfectly organized closet came into view. He was familiar with women's fashion since his company owned a women's clothing line, but the styles in Diana's closet were stunning and one-of-a-kind, definitely not something found in stores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven remembered that Diana was a designer herself and figured these clothes must have been her own creations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It then hit him&mdash;Diana had been married to him for two years, and aside from herself, he had never bought her a single thing. Only now did he realize just how awful he had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave Queenie half a million dollars a month in spending money, yet his own wife&mdash;he treated worse than a maid. Even a maid earned at least tens of thousands of dollars a month, but Diana had nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes, knowing how horribly he had behaved, and thought that he would make it up to her someday, but not now. With this thought, his eyes narrowed dangerously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Steven closed the door and walked over to the next room. The sign on the door read: [Diana's Private Library.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was curious. He pushed the door open, and when he saw the shelves inside, he was stunned. There were so many books, like a small library.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Near the window stood a white desk with three roses in a vase. Though there were only three, they added a touch of life to the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stepped inside and saw the books neatly organized by categories: finance, medicine, design, and various other subjects&mdash;all perfectly arranged on the shelves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the window was a set of sofas, and on one of the sofas sat a small yellow teddy bear next to an adorable little girl doll. She wore a pink hat and had a stuffed rabbit in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven found it adorable that Diana liked such girly things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over and sat down on the sofa. On the table, there were a few books, and in the center, a bowl of nuts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana loved nuts, but Steven had once told her he didn't like them because the shells made a mess. After that, she never ate nuts at home again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned, realizing just how much she had been putting up with for his sake. He sat down and noticed a special notebook with a pink cover and a fountain pen resting on top of it.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="483.html">« Prev</a><a href="485.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
