How could she cheat on him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resentment overwhelmed him, and he couldn't understand why his wholehearted efforts had resulted in such betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During those hard days and nights, he abandoned his children and Paula ruthlessly and did everything he could to provide them with a good life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the cruel truth struck him like a sharp knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff fixed his eyes on Amelie, who was weeping and holding her head in her hands, and felt that everything was ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, he asked in a trembling voice, "I have sacrificed everything for our family. Why did you cheat on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie lay in the snow with her head down, not daring to meet his gaze. She sobbed nonstop and muttered, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes in pain, tears streaming down her cheeks. She was lonely. After she met Mark, they got together, but she had to keep it a secret from Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was sincere to her, but Mark just flirted with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never divorce his wife and marry Amelie. What he feared most was the influence of his wife's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was heartbroken. The love and trust he and Amelie once had completely collapsed at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused and desperate, he didn't know what to do in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Amelie and their two children, he had nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sat next to her. He was tired from fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Amelie looked up. Her cheeks were swollen, and her mouth was covered with blood.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mocked, "Jeff, you are a loser. After divorcing Paula, you are a goof-for-nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have enjoyed wealth and glory for so many years, but in the end, it all vanished. You cannot accept it or the fact that you have nothing, so you vent all your displeasure on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just don't want to be poor. Jeff, you are a complete bastard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hooked up with him to get you business, but you're ungrateful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But did you have to sleep with him?" Jeff roared. A rift had opened between them, and they would never return to their former life.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a man, he couldn't tolerate Amelie's betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even come to terms with not being able to spend</span><span> money</span><span> as he pleased.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he was too poor at the time, he chose Paula, an only child from a wealthy family.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I didn't. Paula deliberately showed you the videos to destroy our relationship. Jeff, you didn't believe me, and you hit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm warning you, you will have to rely on our son and daughter in the future. If you dare to hit me again, I will divorce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was the best at threatening. All of Queenie's tricks were taught by her, so dealing with Jeff was a piece of cake for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he stood up and laughed at her coldly and ruthlessly. "Amelie, for the sake of our children, I forgive you. If I ever find out you contact him again, you will meet your doom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he entered the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna sent the video she shot to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was in a much better mood at that moment. She even ordered herself a cup of hot chocolate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a sip of the hot chocolate, she watched the video of Jeff beating Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She narrowed her eyes and then sneered. They had just been married for a short time, but he started domestic violence.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="616.html">« Prev</a><a href="618.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
