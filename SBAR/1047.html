It was done secretly. You were right. I&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on her. Queenie&rsquo;s colluding with the officials, but unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t get any proof."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, finding it unsurprising that he didn&rsquo;t get any evidence. "She&rsquo;s cunning</span><span> </span><span>&mdash;and now with her past-life memories, she'll be even more extreme. Last time, she probably drugged you first, then hypnotized you. You wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to resist her.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil came to her </span><span>for</span><span> this. "Diana, something else. </span><span>I wasn&rsquo;t thinking clearly that night, but I remember now. There was this sound... faint bells. Every time I heard them, my head would pound.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said coldly, "Just as I thought! </span><span>B</span><span>e more careful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil was a bit nervous. "Diana, I&rsquo;m really scared. I have a bad feeling about this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana reassured him, "Don&rsquo;t worry. Queenie&rsquo;s target right now is me. You can relax."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled, "Diana, that&rsquo;s great. I can finally breathe easy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched him smiling and felt like he wasn&rsquo;t worried about her at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil looked at Diana, but she shot him an unfriendly glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil felt like Diana was utterly disgusted with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana warned, "Make sure you keep an eye on everything Lillian does."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The task was tough, especially since Lillian's medicine was downright terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil would lose his mind the moment he caught a whiff of that medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Cecil, your family might be targeted again. Lillian won&rsquo;t give up. I&rsquo;m taking a break these days, make you something to keep you from falling."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil, who had been a little scared, felt relieved after hearing her words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he could stay rational, Lillian couldn&rsquo;t do anything to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he feared most was ending up like that night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, he was completely under Lillian's control, so much so that he didn&rsquo;t even dare carry his bank card, afraid she&rsquo;d coax the password out of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After being thrown out, Dylan angrily called Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, Diana went too far. She actually had me thrown out. I warned her to give the company back to Steven within three days, or I won&rsquo;t acknowledge her anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought Dylan was being incredibly stupid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana would never hand over the company to Steven so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie held back her anger, "Dylan, </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>company is already in Diana&rsquo;s hands. </span><span>W</span><span>on&rsquo;t easy to get back. </span><span>P</span><span>ut this aside. Go back and apologize to </span><span>Paula</span><span>. Don&rsquo;t fight with her because of me. As long as you stay by her side, half of her fortune will be yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The priority now is to trick Paula out of all her wealth and avenge Noah and my mom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Paula hadn&rsquo;t schemed to steal Noah&rsquo;s company, my mom wouldn&rsquo;t have been driven into a mental breakdown."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan said, "Queenie, wait a bit. </span><span>Paula</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>still mad. I&rsquo;ll talk to her once she calms down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie urged him, "Dylan, if you don&rsquo;t go back, you won&rsquo;t know Eric&rsquo;s company </span><span>and his </span><span>businesses. I</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll </span><span>help you. Or want</span><span>ing</span><span> to hand everything over to your two brothers?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Dylan&rsquo;s personality all too well&mdash;just like his father&rsquo;s.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Selfish, cold, and only cared about money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, Dylan was tempted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He agreed, "Queenie, you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ll go back and pretend to make peace with them. Once I get the business secrets, I&rsquo;ll contact you. You have to help me. Don&rsquo;t worry, you</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll</span><span> get your cut."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie replied, "Alright! Dylan, whatever information you get, take pictures and send them to me. I can help you figure out what&rsquo;s useful and what&rsquo;s not."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan said, "Alright, Queenie. I&rsquo;ll go talk to Mom now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan hung up the phone and stared at the office building in front of him with a smirk. "Diana, I'll teach you a lesson."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a cab to an old neighborhood on the outskirts of the city.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He went upstairs and knocked on the door hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan waited for over ten minutes, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A</span><span> neighbor next door, clearly fed up, opened their door. The neighbor stood behind the security gate, glaring at Dylan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you doing? No one's answering, just leave! You've been knocking non-stop, it's so annoying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The neighbor was an old man who valued his peace. He had been woken up last night and had been holding back his frustration until now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was annoyed, but considering they&rsquo;d be neighbors, he kept his tone polite. "Sir, this is my house. My mom&rsquo;s asleep, and I was worried she couldn&rsquo;t hear me, so I knocked a bit harder."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man snapped, "Nonsense. The family here moved out early this morning. They don&rsquo;t live here anymore. How do you not know that? Are you a thief?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You better leave now, or I&rsquo;m calling the cops."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was stunned. He couldn&rsquo;t believe he was mistaken for a thief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He snapped at the old man. "Watch your words. I&rsquo;m no thief&mdash;I&rsquo;m the young master of the Marsh family. How dare you call me a thief?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man, startled by his angry tone, grabbed his phone and threatened to call the police.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan stopped him, "Wait. Don&rsquo;t call the cops. I&rsquo;ll leave right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man glared at him coldly. "You&rsquo;ve got no manners. Apologize, and I&rsquo;ll let you go. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll call the cops and report you for stealing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan couldn&rsquo;t believe how unreasonable this man was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He refused to apologize, shot a sharp glare at the old man, and hurried down the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once downstairs, he angrily kicked a nearby trash can.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan stared helplessly at the old trash can he had just kicked to pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cleaning lady standing nearby snapped angrily, "What are you doing? You broke the trash can! You need to replace it. Pay up, now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan looked at the broken trash can and muttered, "Is this crappy neighborhood so broke they can't even afford a decent trash can?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1046.html">« Prev</a><a href="1048.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
