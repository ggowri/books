"Diana, do you dislike me so much? No matter how I treated you before, you were always calm and gentle. But now, you seem to have become a different person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered when she heard this, "So, Steven, I should not fight back when you hit me, nor should I retort to you when you scold me. When you bully me, should I endure it like before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was nice to you before because I saved your life. But now, I don't want to be nice to you anymore. You love Queenie, and I won't stop you from being with her. Humph, how dare you still have the nerve to say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't want to talk about this, as they had said it many times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were cold, without any love in them. Steven looked at Diana and suddenly felt heavy in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I think I have already made it very clear." After Diana finished speaking, she stood up and went to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her back and murmured, "Diana, I haven't had dinner yet. I have a stomachache."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stopped and turned to look at him, feeling very angry. "You are not a child, but you can't even take care of yourself. How can you take care of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her, his stomach aching slightly. "Sorry. I'm too busy today and don't have time to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana closed her eyes and thought that if Steven were sick, Helen would call her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the last warmth would sooner or later be exhausted by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana finally turned and went to the kitchen. She cursed herself as she walked, "Damn it! I deserve it. That bastard had left me on the highway this morning and almost caused me to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he has come to my house and is asking for food. He is so cheeky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went to the kitchen, and Steven stood up to help. Seeing that she could only move one hand, he felt guilty again. "What happened today..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't mention that again. I'm afraid I won't be able to control myself and kick you out later," Diana interrupted Steven coldly. She was not so generous as to forgive a man who betrayed and hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said coldly, "Don't feel sorry. Your apology can't change the fact that I'm injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I cook for you because of Helen. She's old, and now she has to worry about you. I feel sorry for her for being so hard all her life. So don't overthink it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm doing this because of Helen's kindness. You have used up my patience towards you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. Diana's patience towards him had been used up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger suddenly surged in his chest again. Steven stared at Diana with intense possessiveness in his eyes, and he didn't even realize it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to eat?" Diana interrupted him calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shut up and watched her cook with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana made soup. She took out a pot, put all the cut ingredients into it, and asked Steven to insert the plug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she opened the refrigerator, took out a cabbage, and made boiled cabbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven liked light food. He enjoyed eating cabbage without adding any season to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took the cabbage and washed it. Diana asked him to break the cabbage into small pieces and then put them in the pot to boil.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="481.html">« Prev</a><a href="483.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
