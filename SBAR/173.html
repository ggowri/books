Queenie came home crying this morning because Diana was bullying her," Gale replied, not even trying to hide his role in the mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced over at the sycamore trees in the park, watching a few leaves flutter down to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula sighed, knowing that no matter what she said, Gale's stubbornness would get in the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pulled out a share transfer document and handed it to him. "You own five percent of the company. I need you to transfer those shares to me. There are people lurking in the shadows trying to buy up shares, and I can't afford to lose my position as chairwoman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale blinked, confusion washing over his face. "Mom, has it really come to this? Shouldn't we just call Frank back to help you run the company?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No. I don't need a love-struck fool or a washed-up loser to help me," Paula said, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was taken aback by her coldness. "Mom, how can you say that about your own son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Cut the crap, Gale. Are you going to give me the shares or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's gaze bore into him, searching for any hint of agreement, but all she found was hesitation, which made her heart sink further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale said, "Mom, you know my company isn't making a profit. My allowance comes from the dividends. If I give you my shares, I won't have any pocket money left."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wasn't unwilling; he just had his own struggles. Racing was an expensive hobby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But if the company goes under, I won't have any money to give you either. If you're not willing, I'll have to figure out another way," Paula said, her mind racing with thoughts of self-preservation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She mused, "Selfish. He's just like Jeff&mdash;selfish to the core.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if he is my son, if they're too selfish, I'll have to consider cutting them off. I need to protect the hard work my parents put in all their lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Paula turned and walked away, tears brimming in her eyes. She thought, "Dad still has money. I'll have him secretly buy up shares from other shareholders. I won't let Queenie win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With my behind-the-scenes maneuvering, it shouldn't be too hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I'm just scared that Gale's shares will end up in Queenie's hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Watching his mother's frail figure retreat, Gale felt a pang of guilt twist in his gut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He realized he hadn't done anything to help her over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale jogged after her. "Mom, it's not that I don't want to give you the shares. I just want to have a little spending money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula, frustrated, pulled out her phone and played a recording for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a conversation between Jeff and Queenie at the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale listened in stunned silence, his heart sinking as he processed the words. He looked at his mother's furious eyes, feeling a wave of sadness wash over him. "Mom, how could you stoop so low just to get my shares? Why would Dad and Queenie do this to me? I've always treated them well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't wrap his head around the idea that his sister, whom he had spoiled all these years, could betray him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To Gale, Queenie had always been sweet and kind, and Jeff had always been supportive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Paula had been the one against his racing, seemingly determined to squash his passion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula scoffed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "So even with the evidence right in front of you, you still refuse to believe it, huh?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="172.html">« Prev</a><a href="174.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
