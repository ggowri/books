How could my father have Alzheimer's disease? It's Paula who has a mental illness."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maeve sneered. Looking at her aggrieved appearance, Maeve was so furious that she wanted to beat her up. She hated mistresses the most, but it happened that Queenie and her mother were both mistresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some things could never be kept secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man's actions would always leave evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maeve felt sorry for Paula. "Queenie, I think you are insane. You are the undisputed mistress. Do you want me to expose you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's mind went blank and kept buzzing. "Mrs. Lopez, mind your language!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did the elderly woman know? Everything she did was confidential.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only recently did Steven discover her affair with Levi. She was a good judge of the situation. Seeing no hope in this man, she would immediately change her target.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Queenie could only rely on herself, for it was impossible for her to be with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she could still make him feel guilty. This was her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie lost her temper and yelled at Maeve, "Mrs. Lopez, what nonsense are you talking about? You slandered Queenie in front of so many people. Are you trying to ruin her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already explained that she is three days older than Diana. Paula was the one who interfered with our relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maeve, watching Paula crying out of grievance, snorted, "You and Jeff dated secretly more than once. My husband has seen you together many times. At first, I just thought you were friends, but today, it finally dawns on me that you are actually lovers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, Jeff was penniless, and he chased after Paula like crazy. Everyone in the circle has witnessed it. There is no doubt that he is guilty of marriage fraud."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her statement was harsh, and she gazed at Amelie coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie trembled and almost collapsed. Why was there still someone standing up for Paula at that moment?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff lowered his head. He had come to tonight's high-end banquet with confidence, but now, his dignity was trampled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had deliberately courted Paula back then. She was simple, beautiful, and rich. Such women like her were the easiest to deceive. Sure enough, he married her with ease and then enjoyed wealth and glory for more than twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when the past was revealed bluntly, humiliation overwhelmed him as if he were being executed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, unwilling to let them off, Maeve continued, "Jeff swapped the two children. It was actually a conspiracy between the two of you. Living with you would make Queenie an illegitimate daughter. Only by staying with Paula could she get the best education and marry into a wealthy family with the help of Paula's connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, she became Steven's fianc&eacute;e."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maeve's words were sharp. Queenie shook and almost fainted. She gasped and stared at the scene in disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="640.html">« Prev</a><a href="642.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
