It was the first time she had seen him laugh so freely.</p><p>Diana watched him for a moment before asking, &quot;What&#x27;s so funny?&quot;</p><p>Steven leaned in, his voice soft and warm, &quot;You&#x27;re adorable.&quot;</p><p>Diana looked a bit puzzled.</p><p>She almost started dwelling on the past again, but quickly shifted her focus. Those memories only brought her pain, and she vowed never to revisit them.</p><p>She said, &quot;Let&#x27;s go. Just ahead is the historic district. We&#x27;ll explore for a bit, then head home.&quot;</p><p>Diana was starting to feel a bit tired.</p><p>After her rebirth, she only went for morning runs and couldn&#x27;t be bothered to train her stamina anymore.</p><p>Steven nodded with a smile. &quot;Alright! Let&#x27;s play a bit more, then we&#x27;ll head home.&quot;</p><p>Steven took her hand and led her toward the nearby historic district.</p><p>Diana loved the district ahead. She remembered shops selling vintage clothing, including Victorian-style outfits. She used to dream of wearing those elegant retro gowns.</p><p>Diana suddenly said, &quot;Steven, my dream wedding isn&#x27;t about wearing a traditional gown to marry you. I want to walk down the aisle in a vintage satin dress. I&#x27;m obsessed with lace-embroidered bridal wear.&quot;</p><p>Steven thought of classic movie wedding scenes, chuckled, and said, &quot;Alright! Then we&#x27;ll have a vintage-themed wedding.&quot;</p><p>Diana muttered softly, &quot;I haven&#x27;t even agreed to marry you yet.&quot;</p><p>Her voice was quiet, but Steven still heard it. He chuckled, confidence radiating from him.</p><p>The next day, Steven still brought Diana along to the office.</p><p>He used the excuse of being unfamiliar with the business to insist on bringing her along.</p><p>Thinking she could finally rest, Diana had no choice but to follow him to the office. As they arrived at the lobby, she unexpectedly spotted Yanson.</p><p>Yanson looked exhausted, worry etched on his face. Spotting Steven, he called out with a hint of grievance, &quot;Steven.&quot;</p><p>Steven&#x27;s voice was cold as ice. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he asked.</p><p>Yanson panicked, his voice trembling. &quot;Steven, I&#x27;m so sorry! I made a mistake before—I failed to recognize you.&quot;</p><p>It was only after watching the livestream and seeing two identical Stevens that Yanson realized just how badly he&#x27;d messed up.</p><p>Yanson finally understood—he&#x27;d been nothing but a fool in front of Diana.</p><p>Steven frowned, his tone sharp. &quot;Yanson, you&#x27;re an idiot. Can you honestly say you weren&#x27;t helping Queenie bully Diana? She was injured, stuck in a wheelchair, and you still went after her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yanson, no matter how desperate you are to climb the social ladder, you can&#x27;t stoop so low as to hurt an injured woman in a wheelchair.&quot;</p><p>Diana&#x27;s eyes widened in surprise. &quot;Was he at the banquet that night too?&quot; she wondered.</p><p>Yanson lowered his head in shame. &quot;Steven, back then, I thought you were going to be with Queenie. Whoever you hated, I hated too. That&#x27;s why I resented Diana.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My family&#x27;s tech company has always survived thanks to your venture capital.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I truly believed you&#x27;d give everything to Diana and run the company with Queenie. I was wrong. Steven, Diana, can you forgive me this once?&quot;</p><p>Yanson apologized sincerely, regretting that he lacked Owen&#x27;s sharp instincts.</p><p>Yanson couldn&#x27;t help but ask Diana, &quot;Diana, why did you call me an idiot before? What was that about?&quot;</p><p>Diana looked surprised and said, &quot;Do I really need a reason for that?&quot;</p><p>Diana&#x27;s eyes were stunning.</p><p>Yanson felt a sharp pain in his heart.</p><p>&quot;Sorry!&quot; Yanson genuinely regretted not recognizing Steven earlier.</p><p>Diana shook her head and said, &quot;No need to apologize. I kicked you off the project because you were too dumb. I couldn&#x27;t let you ruin my plans, and that&#x27;s why you started resenting me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing you did could hurt me because, to me, you&#x27;re just insignificant. Your cruel words only reveal how vile your character is—they can&#x27;t touch me.&quot;</p><p>Yanson stared at Diana in shock, realizing she looked down on him.</p><p>To Diana, he was nothing at all.</p><p>&quot;You...&quot;</p><p>Diana cut straight to the point, saying, &quot;Yanson, Steven&#x27;s been back for days. If you truly regretted it, you would&#x27;ve called to apologize long ago. You wouldn&#x27;t have waited until now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The only reason you&#x27;re here today is because your company is in trouble. You&#x27;re nothing but arrogant and opportunistic.&quot;</p><p>Yanson suddenly remembered—these were the exact words he used to say to Diana when he was busy flattering Queenie and Steven.</p><p>Now, he felt a sharp pain in his chest, a deep humiliation. He finally understood the agony Diana must have endured back then.</p><p>Yanson hadn&#x27;t dared to approach Steven before, simply because he was afraid of his anger.</p><p>The way he had mistreated Diana before made him too ashamed to face Steven.</p><p>But Yanson&#x27;s company was in real trouble now, and he desperately needed Steven&#x27;s help.</p><p>He pleaded with Steven, &quot;Steven, we&#x27;ve been friends for years. Back when I managed your company overseas, I might not have done great, but I didn&#x27;t let it go under. Can you help me this time?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My company was mysteriously hacked yesterday, and the losses are devastating. Steven, I&#x27;m begging you—help me. If you don&#x27;t, my company will go under.&quot;</p><p>Yanson stepped closer to Steven, his eyes filled with desperation and pleading.</p><p>Steven asked sternly, &quot;Your company was hacked?&quot;</p><p>Yanson replied, &quot;Yes. I spoke to Owen. He said it was Queenie&#x27;s doing. Steven, I truly regret everything. Please, I&#x27;m begging you to help me.&quot;</p><p>Now, no one but Steven was willing to help Yanson.</p><p>Owen could only offer minor assistance. </p><p>When it came to cyber security, only Steven had the skills to truly help him.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1122.html">« Prev</a><a href="1124.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
