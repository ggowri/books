"Mr. Borden, over the years, you've exploited the Gellar Group for your own gain, lining your pockets. I have the evidence right here. Whether you speak or stay silent today, you're getting kicked out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird's face hardened. At sixty years old, he had never encountered such a brazen woman. In a company like this, who didn't line their pockets? As long as it wasn't too obvious, no one cared about such trivial matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you need to back up your claims with proof. What do you mean by 'lining your pockets'?" Laird scoffed, doubting she had anything substantial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned her laptop toward him. "Mr. Borden, I never bring up things without proof. I operate on principles of transparency and honesty. These are the facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can either walk away quietly or wait for me to sue you. At that point, you might find your entire fortune turned upside down, especially since your son is a gambler who recently racked up debts in hundreds of millions of dollars. Your family's wealth is on the line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird's expression soured further as he glared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're ruthless! I'll sell my shares to you at double the market price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal," she replied, and her agreement was so swift that it left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Luna. "Luna, have our legal team come in and handle the transition with Mr. Borden."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George watched in disbelief as Diana's decisive actions unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute, I want Mr. Borden's shares!" Jace's voice boomed from the doorway, full of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him, and a cold smile played on her lips. "Sir Foliot, you've finally arrived. A shareholder like you was always destined to be pushed out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jace could respond, Diana addressed Luna, "Luna, bring up the big screen. Let's expose his true colors. Someone like him doesn't deserve to be here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't go too far!" Queenie's heart raced as she recalled Diana's knowledge of her connection with Jace. Panic surged through her. She couldn't let Jace find out the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze turned to Queenie, and she chuckled. "Queenie, why are you so anxious? It's not about you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jace could intervene, Luna swiftly activated the screen, displaying videos of Jace's illicit activities and his scandalous encounters with actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's face twisted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exposure of these videos would ruin him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut it off! Turn it off! These are fake! They're not real!" he shouted, and his voice was laced with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's cool voice cut through his panic. "Sir Foliot, why are you so anxious? There's plenty more where that came from. Should I continue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you insufferable woman! Turn it off now!" Jace looked ready to explode, and his fury was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could do anything, he found himself on the chopping block, completely exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana instructed Luna to turn off the screen, then turned her attention back to Jace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Foliot, you hold only three percent of the shares, which means you have no right to speak here. Everyone in this room has seen what you're capable of. If anyone wishes to support Mr. Sir Foliot, I will not hesitate to dismantle the Gellar Group entirely. What I need is a clean slate, a company that can thrive and make money together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Ms. Bishop, making money isn't just about talking big. It requires real action. I heard you didn't even graduate high school. Can you even read a contract?" A young board member's voice boomed across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned her gaze toward him, recognizing that he wasn't one of Queenie's or George's allies. She knew Leones Flemming, son of Walter Flemming. He had followed Steven back to start a venture after being impressed by Steven's talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Flemming, rumors are just that rumors. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly interrupted, and her tone dripped with sarcasm, "Diana, running a company isn't about playing petty games over men. The fact is, you didn't finish high school, which means you can't even understand a contract. How do you plan to run a company?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Gellar Group will be picked apart within three months under your leadership. Do you want to see all these employees lose their jobs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea how many of them have families to support and mortgages to pay? If they lose their jobs, how are they supposed to survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Queenie's tirade, George chimed in, "Diana, running a company isn't child's play. You've used underhanded methods to take control of the Gellar Group, and now do you want to jeopardize everyone's livelihoods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones and several other board members glared at Diana. Their expressions filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at George. Still unsure of his name, she referred to him as Mr. Gellar, saying, "Mr. Gellar, care to explain why you lost all your operational rights."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze, realizing she was at a disadvantage with Diana holding the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, stop trying to twist the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to the other board members. "Everyone, I can guarantee that someone who didn't even finish high school has no business managing this company. The Gellar Group belongs to the Gellar family, and we should invite Mr. Andrew Gellar back to take charge. Of course, we need Steven, and he will continue to lead us to profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But someone like Diana, who's utterly useless, should be removed from the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shot Diana a condescending smile, confident that as long as she had this leverage over Diana, no shareholder would dare support Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had too many weaknesses to exploit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones tapped the table, drawing attention back to himself. "Ms. Bishop, while you may hold a larger share, we can't trust the company to someone who's clearly out of their depth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words set a precedent, and soon, all the shareholders expressed their dissent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! We won't hand over the company to some clueless girl!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George spoke up again, "Diana, I understand your desire to get the chairman's position, but who would trust you with the company? Everyone here is driven by profit. In this ruthless business world, profit is the name of the game. It's no surprise that all the shareholders are united against you. We're all working hard for our bottom line, and no one's foolish enough to support someone who lacks the capability to generate any value. That's just survival instinct. I suggest you step aside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let him finish, and a cold smile crept onto her face as she surveyed the crowd. "It's truly laughable that you all take Queenie's word for it and conclude that I lack the ability to lead."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="914.html">« Prev</a><a href="916.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
