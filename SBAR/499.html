"Diana, I've been watching them closely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a wave of relief wash over her. She led Luna inside, only to be halted by Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Days had passed since their last encounter, and Eric looked utterly disheveled. He wore a black leather jacket paired with casual, wide-leg pants that were creased beyond recognition. His typically clean-shaven, handsome face was now shadowed with stubble. His hair was unwashed, giving him a rumpled appearance. Dark circles under his eyes and bloodshot eyes betrayed his exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a step back in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happened to you?" she asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The winter breeze was crisp, tousling her smooth hair and carrying the faint scent of flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric clenched his fists and stared at Diana intensely. In truth, Diana was more beautiful than Queenie, but before, Queenie's perceived grievances had created an illusion that Diana had bullied Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, why did you block me out?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback by the softness in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned and gazed at him. "Eric, just say what you want. Don't act like this. Every time you speak gently, you're about to ask me for a favor, and it's always for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no matter what it is this time, I won't agree to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric felt a lump in his throat. It was true; in the past, whenever he'd approached Diana, it was to take her possessions and give them to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Diana. I didn't come here for anyone else. I called you that night, asking for your help. I'm sorry for what happened. I came to apologize, Diana. It's me who's sorry for everything before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was filled with remorse for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Queenie's sake, he had nearly destroyed his own mother and sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Paula had wanted nothing to do with Eric and his brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula saw now that they were as malevolent as Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned by his words and thought, "What kind of trouble was Eric getting into over that land?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "I'm sorry! Eric, you don't think that a simple apology will make me hand over that land to Queenie for free, do you? I've made it clear that I have no ties to anyone in your family. Leave now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you want that land, have Queenie buy it for 1 billion dollars. I don't believe you can just take my things like thieves, like you've done before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, throw him out. If he dares to show up at my company again, kick him out immediately, or put up a sign that says no one from the Marsh family is allowed in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana turned and entered the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric watched her go. Sadness enveloped him. Diana would never forgive him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I never meant to steal your things. I'm sincerely apologizing, Diana..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough. Diana doesn't need your apologies. What she needs is for you to stay away from her. It was your family that chose to cut ties with Diana, so please, stop bothering her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family is truly despicable. You kicked Diana out, and now you want to take her possessions. If you dare show your faces in front of Diana again, I'll expose every dirty secret of the Marsh and Barnes families, leaving you with nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere sight of the Marsh family made Luna want to lash out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Eric didn't retaliate with anger. He seemed to have matured overnight. Upon uncovering the scheme concocted by his father and Queenie, he finally realized his father, who had always voiced support for his ambitions, had covertly woven a web that made finding a job nearly impossible for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric looked at Luna and announced, "You have my word, I won't cause any more trouble for Diana."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="498.html">« Prev</a><a href="500.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
