Steven would feel empty and </span><span>unable to breathe</span><span> if she weren't in the house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked over at Queenie and said, "Mr. Gellar, didn't you leave Queenie to take care of you? If I go back to look after you, it will seem like I'm bothering you two."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was stunned, and her lie was revealed on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who told you she was taking care of me?" Steven didn't understand why she kept </span><span>bringing up</span><span> this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Queenie's flustered eyes, Diana said indifferently,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I was downstairs just now, Ms. Marsh said that you asked her to take care of you at the villa and that she complimented you on how manly you were last night. Since you</span><span> two</span><span> were playing passionately, I will leave you alone. I wish you'll have a baby soon. Is that all right? Can you leave now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Queenie </span><span>coldly</span><span>. "Is that what you told my wife?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was shocked. "Your wife? Steven, what did you just call her? Wife?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, have you forgotten what you did to me last night? What am I to you if you call her wife now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, shut up. I was at the office last night, but you said you were in my bed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was shocked. "Aren't you always at home? Why were you at the office?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised her eyebrows and looked at Queenie, who was arrogant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, haven't you heard the story of the Boy Who Cried Wolf? If you do it once or twice, someone may believe it, but what if you do it eight or ten times?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I told you the other day if you ever provoked me again, I would expose you for everything you did."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was so pissed off that she kept stomping her foot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was just glad when she could irritate Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, Diana was </span><span>determined</span><span> to expose Queenie for all her vicious behavior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh! Let me guess. Since you called Steven here to see me, what did you tell him? Did you say that I was lascivious and fawning? Or did you say I keep seducing men for money?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then, it was Cecil last night, and today it's a strange man. I'm sure that's what you told him. And you took a picture of me and sent it to Steven, and I saw it when you took it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, you keep using the same shameless tricks every time, and </span><span>only </span><span>an idiot will believe it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes were somber as he thought, "</span><span>Is</span><span> Diana </span><span>saying that I</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>m </span><span>that idiot?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't even have to think about it to realize that Diana was talking about him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, he did believe the pictures Queenie sent him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Diana in shock, and she had truly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana became afraid of nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was careful about what she did in front of Steven before, for fear that Steven would be dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Diana was just completely following her heart, as if she really didn't want Steven anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, that's the truth. You met with two men, and do you want to sleep with a lot of men together?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie wasn't afraid to offend them. Anyway, she believed Steven would always protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Steven didn't protect her, her parents and four brothers would do so.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, Queenie wasn't guilty at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Steven didn't believe her now, she had a way to make him believe her again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes suddenly turned indifferent.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="85.html">« Prev</a><a href="87.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
