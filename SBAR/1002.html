Steven regretted it. He regretted it deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, during moments like this, Evan would have been unable to resist mocking Steven a little, but this time, he couldn't bring himself to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's pained expression made him only feel sympathy. He hadn't understood love back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan had fought alongside Steven, and he knew how hard it had been for him to get to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I've known Diana for many years, but I've never seen her so happy before," Evan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan saw Diana's radiant smile, and honestly, it made him happy as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile was beautiful and could heal the soul, instantly wiping away any gloom in the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's hands, resting on his lap, tightened suddenly upon hearing Evan's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's smile had always been for him in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "That bastard, Alexander, is trying to steal my woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he wouldn't have tolerated it. He would have walked over to Diana and mocked her harshly, asking why she was smiling so carefreely at another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, what right did he have to say anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Alexander, over time, his good qualities and excellence would surely win Diana over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, I'll get her back. The person I once lost, I will get her back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew he still had a chance. As he looked at Diana again, he saw Jeff standing in front of her with a woman. His brows furrowed slightly, clearly displeased. He thought, "What's Jeff doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Alexander were talking happily when she suddenly saw Jeff, and she was also a little surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Christmas, no one was happier than Jeff. He had gotten rid of Amelie, that shrew. Through her, he had obtained some business secrets and managed to steal Mark's company. Now, he was with a young and beautiful assistant. His mood was particularly good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only regret was that he wasn't quite up to sleep with her and had to rely on medication each time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie suddenly called him and informed him that Diana wasn't his biological daughter. He was shocked. At that time, Paula had been having an affair with another man, and Diana was the result of that affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something he couldn't accept. He'd been cheated by Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because she felt so guilty. Ever since giving birth to Diana, Paula had been incredibly kind to him. He had even thought he was lucky to have found such a wonderful wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he realized it was because she had felt guilty towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was furious. "Diana, so you're just the illegitimate child? Lucky for me, I never acknowledged you as my daughter. If I had, I'd have been sick to my stomach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had everything Mark had, his business was booming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Diana, Paula, and his ungrateful children would one day come crawling back to beg him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he thought of Paula's betrayal, bitterness filled his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at him quietly for a while, then sneered, "Great, I'm really happy that I wasn't tainted by your filthy blood. I'm so happy. It's an honor that I have no blood ties with a shameless woman like Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was so enraged by her words that he took a step back, staring at her with a cold gaze. "Diana, how dare you call my blood filthy? You, an illegitimate child who doesn't even know who your father is, have the nerve to say that to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, a sharp pain hit Diana's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "So this is what it felt like to be called an illegitimate child. It really hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander furrowed his brows slightly. His eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana forced a bitter smile. "Jeff, don't forget. Your real daughter also comes from the same background as me. You should be more virtuous in life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't say that. Jeff has always been a good man. It's you all who've gone too far." Jeff's current wife, Grace Marsh, looked at Diana with a mocking gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked her in confusion, "Are you Mr. Jeff Marsh's current wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace happily linked her arm with Jeff's, smiling widely, "Yes, I'm his current wife. Your mother doesn't have a chance anymore. Don't think just because Jeff is doing well now, she can come crawling back. With me around, it's absolutely impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh, "Don't worry. A scumbag like him is only precious to you. No one will try to steal him away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Diana glanced at Jeff again, thinking that he had been spoiled by Paula to the point of being na&iuml;ve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jeff Marsh, why do you think you can take away everything from Mr. Foliot so easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff froze slightly. Actually, even without Diana's words, he had felt that taking everything from Mark had been too easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tilted her head, smiling at Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander didn't say anything but silently observed her, admiring every gesture, every word. It was as if she controlled the entire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jeff Marsh, everything you have now will soon vanish. Mrs. Foliot deliberately had you take everything from Mr. Foliot, just so she could completely sever his ties with Amelie. Her end is being discarded by you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the outcome she deserves. She's been holding onto Mr. Foliot and you for no reason other than to profit off you, keeping your wealth tightly in her hands. She never cared for her biological son or daughter. She only cares about herself. She doesn't love anyone. She only loves herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's chest tightened sharply. Diana's words made him realize, with a jolt, that he had fallen into Lily's trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had told him that Paula hadn't really gone bankrupt. The reason she acted the way she did was to force him into initiating the divorce. In fact, Paula had already transferred all her assets elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Jeff pieced it all together, he was shaken to his core. He trembled, almost fainting from the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace quickly supported him. "Jeff, are you... are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Jeff with a smile in her eyes. Jeff was on the verge of passing out. His time would quickly come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had taken her parents abroad for a trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Jeff's retribution was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered Lily had once said that after taking care of everything, she would go on a trip with her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff quickly steadied himself, shaking his head violently to suppress the anger rising in his chest. He glared at Diana, his voice seething with fury. "Diana, enough of your nonsense! I'm going to find Paula and get back all the money she deceived me into giving her. When we divorced, she tricked me and transferred all the assets. You know about this, don't you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1001.html">« Prev</a><a href="1003.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
