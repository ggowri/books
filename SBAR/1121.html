Let me see it. I don</span><span>'</span><span>t want to mistake someone else for him when we meet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold said, "Diana, even though your father wasn't by your side, he was always watching over you. Every gift you wanted as a child? He was the one who bought them for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember that teddy bear you had? Your dad made it for you himself. All these years, he's cared about you, even if he couldn't be there to guide you in person."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Every year, he captured your growth in photos. Diana, we both love you deeply."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You were never alone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Leopold spoke, tears streamed down his weathered face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had finally waited for this day to come.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he still didn</span><span>'</span><span>t show Diana the photos, feeling it wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t the right time yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gently wiped Leopold</span><span>'</span><span>s tears and said, </span><span>"</span><span>Don</span><span>'</span><span>t cry. At your age, what if you hurt your eyes?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana comforted Leopold, she ended up crying first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but chuckle. </span><span>"</span><span>That won</span><span>'</span><span>t do. I still need to see you get married.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold</span><span>'</span><span>s tears were of joy. He had waited twenty-four years for this day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thankfully, his health held up, and he finally lived to see this day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward's eyes were red as he spoke. "Diana, all the misunderstandings are cleared now. Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s actions hurt you deeply, but he knows he was wrong. Diana, whatever you decide from here on, we</span><span>'</span><span>ll all support you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was a good woman. It was her resilience and unwavering loyalty that ultimately saved Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward had always felt guilty that the grudges of past generations had caused them so much pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry. Our generation's grudges have brought you so much pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward's expression was grave; he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t bear the thought of Steven losing Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana flashed Edward a bright smile. "As long as we're part of this family, we all share the responsibility. Now that everything's resolved, it's a happy ending for everyone. Jenny and Andrew can finally be together without hiding anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You and Helen are safe now. Steven will have his family by his side and finally feel the love he deserves."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's still time to make things right."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had already faced death once, so her mindset was unshakable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward gave a warm smile. "Diana, that's wonderful. You've always been such a kind and remarkable girl."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen handed over a share transfer document and said, "Diana, this is everything I own. It's all yours now. I'm deeply grateful for everything you've done for Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Helen, Steven has already given me so much. I really don't need this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Managing assets was exhausting; all she wanted was to retire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If her dreams were simple, she'd live a happy life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t take no for an answer. She forced Diana to sign the papers and then sent them home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven drove Diana back home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn</span><span>'</span><span>t speak on the drive back, but the atmosphere remained calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat quietly, gazing out at the night. The streets were bustling, and Capitole was especially lively after dark.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought to herself, "Grandpa lied to me all these years to protect me. My father's identity must be anything but ordinary."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The toys from her childhood were bought by her father, and the teddy bear was handmade by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing her father loved her was enough to make Diana feel truly blessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They remained silent all the way back to the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After shutting the car door, Steven finally walked over to her side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, what were you thinking about in the car?" he asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was standing so close that Diana could feel the warmth of his breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he was gentle like this, he was irresistibly handsome, stirring something deep inside her. "I was thinking about my dad. Even if I couldn't see it, at least in his own way, he loved me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled brightly. "Steven, even though fate cruelly separated me from my dad, he still loves me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your parents couldn't be there as you grew up, but they've always been quietly supporting you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't blame them anymore. Life is short, and true happiness comes from making those around you happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as you hold on to hope, you'll eventually get a response.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven paused, a hint of jealousy in his voice. "And you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t think about us at all?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lowered his head slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a step back, a playful smile on her lips. "I've already thought about us. The one who needs to figure things out is you. So, have you decided how you're going to win me over?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I gave it my all when I was chasing you. If you want me to say yes, you'll have to move me first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana finished speaking, patted his head gently, and turned to head upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled and followed her into the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was incredibly attentive when it came to taking care of Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He poured her a glass of warm water, knowing she'd had something heavy tonight. "Diana, drink this," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was feeling thirsty, so she took the glass and drank it all in one go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing the water, she sat on the couch, scrolling through her phone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat down beside her and glanced at the time&mdash;it was just past 8 o'clock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Diana, how about we go for a walk?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked, "Where would we go?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Paige sent her a message.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Diana, Julius is serious! He's started pursuing me. He's picking me up after work tonight. Julius in a white shirt is just too handsome.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Diana, Julius is so handsome! I secretly snapped a photo&mdash;he's even more dashing than a prince! I'm definitely having sweet dreams tonight, filled with steamy moments with him. A man this gorgeous is meant to be mine!]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought Paige was way too blunt!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at the screen and noticed both Paige and Althea had a thing for muscular hotties.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius was undeniably handsome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly realized Steven was nearby and quickly put her phone away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What did you see?" she stammered nervously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her, casually asking, "What does Paige mean by 'intense interactions'?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1120.html">« Prev</a><a href="1122.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
