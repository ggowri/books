I won't marry her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What's more, if anyone dares to interfere with my marriage to Diana, don't blame me for being unkind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Stunned, Queenie forced out a sentence after a long time. "Are you going back on your word?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven raised his sharp eyebrows, his ocean-like gaze showing no emotion. "I didn't. You left first. Diana wouldn't have married me if not for your father..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But you didn't say no in the first place." Queenie interrupted sorrowfully, her eyes teary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff went panicked. He knew well why Steven married Diana back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if Queenie had stayed, she couldn't have married Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's grandpa only wanted Diana to be Steven's wife, otherwise, he wouldn't have let Steven take over the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now as the CEO of the Gellar Group, he was capable to confront his grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he wanted to marry Queenie, no one could stop him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, he felt something was off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There must be something off with Steven today given his calmness after he knew Diana had poisoned his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff couldn't look through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As perceptive as always, Queenie had noticed Steven's change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She angrily stood up and ran upstairs crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula pretended to be worried. "Queenie, don't be too upset. Steven's love for you is unwavering. He won't marry anyone but you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie ignored her and quickly went upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at Paula. She acted very strange tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then left the Marsh Villa in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A table full of carefully prepared dishes remained untouched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff furrowed his brows at Paula who was lost in thought. "Honey, don't be angry. Steven will come to his senses. Eat something first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You go upstairs to comfort Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff pressed his lips. He wasn't good at comforting people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But seeing Paula's compelling gaze, he stood up and went upstairs to check on his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula picked up a lobster and cracked it open. This meal was never meant for the two of them. It was prepared for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She ate heartily, and then found an excuse to leave for the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She glanced upstairs before leaving, a mysterious smile flashing across her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Royal Island, a five-star hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and her friends stayed on the island last night. She set an alarm in case she would be late for the divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She sat up as soon as the alarm went off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah!" She let out a scream seeing a dark figure by the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fearing she might be hallucinating, Diana pinched the back of her hand hard. Immediately, a drop of blood appeared on her smooth skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her voice trembled as she saw the blood and felt the pain. "It hurts. I'm not dreaming."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Steven, terrified.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="108.html">« Prev</a><a href="110.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
