"Steven, I don't need to do anything special. The scales of your heart have already tipped. You care about me, and that's why you're willing to hurt her. I know Diana's temperament well enough; she won't ever marry you, even if she stays single for life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran through Steven at her words. Deep down, he knew Diana would never forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an air of nonchalance, he replied, "Queenie, I will do everything in my power to win her back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven just laughed and walked away, leaving her feeling deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she took a few steps back, a troubling thought crossed her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Steven just say he would fight to get Diana back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has he realized that the one he truly loves is Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, Queenie had known all along that Steven's heart belonged to Diana even before their divorce agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just hadn't wanted to confront it, convinced that he would never let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario walked over and spoke softly, "Ms. Marsh, the competition is about to begin. Let's go inside first. Mr. Swift is also eagerly anticipating your performance. If you manage to win first place today, he can help clear your name. Mr. Swift has already arrived and is watching from over there. He was quite pleased when he saw Mr. Gellar show you such affection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Queenie felt a surge of confidence. She was determined to claim first place in this competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flashed a smile at Zion before turning to enter the venue, her resolve firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "This time, I will show Steven that I'm the best, and I'll crush Diana beneath my heels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The competition was straightforward, each designer showcased five outfits modeled by their chosen models. The judges and audience would score them, both live and online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entries were anonymous and presented in order, and the highest score would win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The event kicked off at 9 AM sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana and Paige bumped into each other backstage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige arrived with five models, each one carefully nurtured under her guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, my models are here for you! What about the outfits you designed?" Paige asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana instructed Luna to get the models ready, feeling grateful for Paige's help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much for bringing them over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, no need for thanks! Those ten male models you sent my way made my company a fortune. I've heard your spring collection is amazing too. Our company is participating in the spring fashion show, so let's collaborate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige felt like Diana had hit the jackpot since dropping her "love-struck" mindset. Every event she organized now seemed to go off without a hitch, and the profits were rolling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana playfully poked Paige's nose. "That's fantastic! With you on my side, I can just kick back and relax, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige noticed how much more rational Diana had become since leaving Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she would've been too wrapped up in him to even think about meeting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been a whirlwind of attention, revolving around Steven 24/7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Paige was surprised to find Diana joking about taking it easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Certainly, prioritizing love above all else is unwise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embracing it wholeheartedly can come at the expense of many invaluable parts of oneself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute! You're going to use this cash cow just to kick back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Actually, I have a secret wish. Do you want to hear it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's curiosity piqued. "What's this wish of yours?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="841.html">« Prev</a><a href="843.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
