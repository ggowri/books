And that five million dollars is gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man said, "Humph! I told you before that the plan would easily lead to trouble. You didn't listen to me. Now Steven has noticed your ambitions. You can not let him know of my existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, we're screwed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was also very angry. She did not expect Diana to suddenly fight back. "I know. I will find a way to deal with the follow-up matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't hear any sweet words, so she hung up the phone angrily. She loved him, but he only seemed to be using her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath and looked at the snow outside the window. It was a bit dazzling. Occasionally, cold wind blew in through the window, making her frown. She sat back in the living room, staring at the flowers not far away in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got what she wanted was still in a bad mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, she would have to face the revenge of Paula and Diana. Diana said that she would drag Queenie into hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was still young and wouldn't do such an impulsive thing, but the Gellar family need to be dealt with quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew couldn't hurt his parents, so Diana would do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stayed on the island for ten days before returning home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a day's rest, she was full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph sent her a message saying that Priya&zwnj; had been discharged from the hospital and liked the house she lived in now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied to all the messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana never heard from Penelope again. Penelope would not truely repent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope's incident was nothing to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew that Diana was back and asked her to meet near the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to treat her to lunch. Diana thought of looking for cooperation with him recently, so at noon, she brought the cooperation proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cooperation plan was the AI-assisted diagnosis system she was developing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a huge project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technology industry had not yet appeared, but if it could serve as a starting point, it would attract the favor of many investors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander, it would be easy for Diana. And he was trustworthy and very capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't even need to find investors. As long as she cooperated with Alexander and Micah, she would be successful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something she had worked hard to develop over the past two years while taking care of Steven after he fell asleep or when he was not at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Diana would work with Micah to form a core R&amp;D team and continue research and development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was wearing a white jacket and a beige hat, leaving only her eyes exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna drove over to pick her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana got in the car, Luna asked, "Diana, Paula is bankrupt. Are you happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "No. She's not really broke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna said, "But they have no remorse at all. They didn't even want to say sorry for what they did to you before, and now they are getting their comeuppance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was amused by Luna's angry look. "Luna, the one who will get retribution in the end is Queenie. Their revenge was also my revenge. Let's just wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna felt uncomfortable. Thinking of what happened to Diana, Luna was angry. "Diana, when will Queenie find out that the company is just a shell?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="584.html">« Prev</a><a href="586.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
