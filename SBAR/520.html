Now, she had been away for half a year. She was living comfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, she would think of him and feel sad. But she understood that life was not just about love, and family affection was more precious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "My grandfather and my three brothers love me so much. I'll not let anything happen to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and stopped thinking about the unpleasant things in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana got out of bed and went to the bathroom. After coming out, she went to the closet and found a beautiful lounge suit to change into. Diana walked to the window and saw it was snowing outside. She smiled slightly. It was the first snow of the year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "It's beautiful. I can make snowmen again in my backyard in a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana was about to turn around, she suddenly thought that the first snow day last year was the day when Queenie came back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie could enter and leave their villa freely and had always been ambiguous with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had been depressed every day then. But Steven couldn't see it. All his thoughts were on Queenie. Diana's heart couldn't stop aching now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She placed her hands on her chest and smiled bitterly, thinking, "I still feel heartbroken, even though I have clearly forgotten about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cell phone on her table rang. Diana walked over and picked it up. It was an unfamiliar number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had a hunch that it was Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed the answer button. "Hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm outside the villa. It's snowing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's voice came through, deep and pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the snow outside the window, smiling, "What are you doing here? Haven't I made it clear enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been heartbroken just now because she remembered him. Now, receiving his call made her even more unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were like this sometimes. Even though they had let it go, they still felt upset when they occasionally thought of that person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat on the tatami by the window. It was gloomy outside and snowing lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blurry outline was reflected in the glass. It was still delicate and pleasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana placed her fingers gently on the cold glass. Through the glass, she could clearly see the tiny snowflakes outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was snowing, but she was in a bad mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's snowing. I remember that you were afraid of the cold every year when it snowed." Steven's voice was filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana, who no longer loved him, didn't sense it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some things and some people, if you no longer cared about them, you wouldn't listen carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "I'm not afraid of the cold anymore, Steven. I said it was cold in front of you at that time to attract your attention. But your thoughts were all on Queenie. You were worried about whether she would be tired, suffer, and feel cold abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were still suffering and couldn't even stand up. But you tried so hard to care for Queenie. In fact, I had already decided to give up on you at that time and thought I would help you when she came back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I didn't expect that after she came back, she would scheme against me one after another. You only wanted to please her and never believed my single word. I was angry, so I didn't sign the divorce agreement you gave me a few times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed at herself, tears welling up in her eyes. "Thinking back, what I did was really childish. Steven, I really don't want you anymore. Can you please stop disturbing my life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said it calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "I really don't want him anymore. I have lived two lifetimes. I understand now that love is dispensable, but my life must be my own."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="519.html">« Prev</a><a href="521.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
