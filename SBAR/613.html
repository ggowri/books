You were serious, and so was I."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your life has nothing to do with me. Ms. Barnes, please leave and take the clam chowder with you. I don't want it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was indifferent and determined not to forgive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula did not take the clam chowder away. She walked away weeping, her head bowed in sorro</span><span>w.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood up, called Luna over, and asked her to return the thermos to Paula, and then she continued to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could stop her from making money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by making herself stronger could she gain a firm foothold in the challenging and competitive world, resist the obstacles, protect those she loved, pursue dreams that were once out of reach, keep hope alive, have enough courage and strength to fight and change when facing injustice and setbacks, stand out from the vast crowd, and make her own achievements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath and worked hard. Next, she still had to review a lot of documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paula reached the first floor, Luna caught up with her. "Ms. Barnes, take it back. Diana doesn't need you to make clam chowder for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had already investigated her. She was Diana's assistant. "Luna, how is Diana doing these days?" she asked with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied, "She is fine. We have grown up with her. Even without parental love, she is definitely more outstanding than you've imagined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold face, she put the thermos in Paula's arms and then turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula stood in the snow and cried softly. Diana would never forgive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking voice came from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula glanced up and saw Jeff and Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie held his hand and gazed at her arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was she who snorted just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula immediately calmed down and glared at the shameless couple. "Jeff, this is the mistress you have raised for more than ten years. She is obese and strong</span><span> indeed</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned. How did she know that he had raised Amelie for more than ten years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, that's not the case..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula interrupted him with a smile, "Jeff, you accept every woman who approaches you. Despite being aware that she is Mr. Dixon's lover, you still treat her as well as ever. Trash will eventually stay with trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was shocked by what she had discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie and Mark were actually old classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, they should have been intimate for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff really deserved to be cuckolded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was dumbfounded, glaring at Paula's elegant and gentle face. She </span><span>just</span><span> snort</span><span>ed a bit</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paula insulted her and exposed her secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, she yelled, "Paula, don't talk nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sneered. She was worried that she would not have the chance to show the videos to Jeff, but now, it was the perfect timing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned on her phone, gave him a mocking smile, and played the videos. "Jeff, </span><span>just see what your dear had done with</span><span> Mr. Dixon."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="612.html">« Prev</a><a href="614.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
