"What</span><span>'</span><span>s wrong, Ms. Scott? Don</span><span>'</span><span>t you understand what I</span><span>'</span><span>m saying?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe felt utterly wronged. "Ms. Bishop, did I do something wrong to make you insult me like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, she knew Diana was calling her fake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe looked at Steven pitifully, but he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t look at her. Instead, he lowered his head, laughing. His smile was captivating, and Chloe found herself drawn to him. It only made her feel more humiliated. She turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had wanted Steven to see how malicious Diana was, deliberately picking on her. But Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even spare her a glance. That</span><span>'</span><span>s when she knew&mdash;Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t like her. Still, she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t going to give up. She refused to believe any man could resist temptation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she walked away, she cast a lingering glance at Steven. Diana could tell&mdash;Chloe liked him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she walked away, Diana looked at Steven and said, "She likes you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly shook his head. "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know, and I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t even look at her twice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smirked lightly. "So, the one making coffee for you isn</span><span>'</span><span>t Tom, but Chloe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven admitted casually, "Yeah, it</span><span>'</span><span>s her. But she</span><span>'</span><span>s so clumsy, spilled coffee everywhere."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t say the rest. In social settings, he had met plenty of women like Chloe. He could see right through her intentions in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said thoughtfully, "Chloe was brought in by Tom. She has a bright future. Why would she want to seduce you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand why someone as capable as Chloe would bother messing with her. But since Chloe had crossed her, Diana wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t about to let it slide. She knew Chloe</span><span>'</span><span>s tricks were just like Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head. "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow. "Then what do you know?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked into her beautiful eyes, serious and unwavering. "All I know is, I</span><span>'</span><span>m yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze. In her memory, Steven was never the type to say sweet things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Steven suddenly took her hand. Diana looked at him, confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven offered a perfectly good reason. "Diana, you</span><span>'</span><span>re exhausted. I</span><span>'</span><span>m afraid you</span><span>'</span><span>ll fall."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a cold laugh. "Steven, I</span><span>'</span><span>m not a child anymore. No matter how tired I am, I won</span><span>'</span><span>t fall."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven disagreed and pulled her into the car parked by the roadside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Steven and Diana got in the car, Evan cheerfully asked, "Mr. Gellar, Mrs. Gellar, did you have fun?" He sounded even more excited than they were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced sideways at Diana. "Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t argue. They did have a good time. She asked, "Evan, has Queenie been up to anything lately?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the night sky, Evan replied while driving, "No, Mrs. Gellar. She</span><span>'</span><span>s just busy claiming George</span><span>'</span><span>s assets and treating her leg. Oh, and she</span><span>'</span><span>s moved in with Mario."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned slightly. She remembered now&mdash;Mario was the man who had stayed by Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s side in her past life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan said, "Even I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t see it coming. Mario looks so unremarkable, yet he</span><span>'</span><span>s the one who outlasted all you big shots."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t shake the feeling that something was off, though she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t quite put her finger on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed her drifting into thought again and quickly planted a kiss on her cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling his breath and meeting his gaze, Diana could hear her heart racing. "What are you doing?" she asked, her tone a little rushed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked, "What</span><span>'</span><span>s on your mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Mario."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face darkened. He commanded, "You're not allowed to think about other men."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana flinched at his cold tone. She snapped, "Why are you yelling? You scared me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly apologized, "Sorry! I'll remember to keep my voice down next time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had changed so much over the past two weeks. It was like he had become a different, gentler Steven. He would cook with her, watch TV together, and even read the books she loved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The things Diana once wished for had all come true. He had become so easygoing, and it seemed like his whole world revolved around her. But even though this version of Steven was wonderful, she couldn't help feeling a little unfamiliar with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana noticed the hint of hurt in his tone, and her annoyed expression softened instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember what you said. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t brush me off," she said, her tone tinged with frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan could clearly sense the change between them. They were no longer distant, no longer at each other's throats.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was naturally a good woman. She wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t just kind-hearted; she always considered things from others</span><span>'</span><span> perspectives, especially when it came to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she could be overly kind at times, she brought a ray of light into others' dark worlds, giving those lost in the shadows a glimpse of hope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those years had been tough for Steven, full of hardship. Diana's presence made him feel less alone. Steven had always been a bit slow when it came to feelings, but now he finally realized the one he truly loved was Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan smiled brightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they arrived at the hospital. Steven and Diana brought the medicine to Edward's room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew and Steven arranged for a male nurse to take care of Edward together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After explaining to Andrew how to take the medicine, Steven took Diana downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still didn</span><span>'</span><span>t call Andrew "Dad." All these years, he never had. Even after Steven learned the truth, he just couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let it go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By coincidence, they ran into Queenie and Mario, who were there for a follow-up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had found out Edward was hospitalized here and deliberately chose this hospital to have her leg checked. She hoped to run into Steven. And sure enough, he was here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie gave a bitter smile. "Steven, you lied to me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1109.html">« Prev</a><a href="1111.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
