Just like Diana used to do, Queenie would wait near the company if she couldn't find Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tables had turned, and now it was Queenie's turn.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was so happy she wanted to shout, "Heaven spares no one."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said calmly, "Go find me a diving coach."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was surprised. "Mr. Gellar, do you have time to go diving?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven thought for a moment. "I have two hours on the weekend. I'll start learning on the weekends."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was surprised by his whelms.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan replied, "Okay, Mr. Gellar. I'll find one as soon as I'm done with my work."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wondered if Steven could handle diving in the sea.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Evan left, Steven stared at Diana's posts.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't use to share much, but after leaving him, she would sometimes post.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that in a few hours, she would share her hard work.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven tried to focus on his work, but his heart was restless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana dove nine meters underwater. The visibility wasn't great, but she saw a lobster nest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was good at catching lobsters by hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had trained on a small island until she was 16. Her diving skills were very good.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric taught her, and by the age of 10, she was brave enough to dive alone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Free diving and swimming with whales in the sea was an incredible feeling.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, she caught three lobsters. Looking at the lobsters floating, she was excited.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After catching the lobsters, she found two conch shells. They were too heavy, so she sent her catch to the shore.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was surprised. "Diana, you were only down there for half an hour, and your net is already full."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea saw the three big lobsters and smiled widely. They could have lobster meat for dinner.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana poured out the lobsters and other seafood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled happily, "Althea, there's so much seafood today. Wait for me. There are many groupers down there. I'll catch a few more, and you won't need to buy fish for a while."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was a bit worried. "Diana, we don't have a spear gun. How will you catch them?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took out a special fishing net from the trunk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled, "I can't catch them directly. I'll catch a small fish and set a trap to lure them in. There are many fish in that area.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After setting the trap, I'll continue collecting shells and squid. I'll bring a spear with me when I dive."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana went back into the water with her tools.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea shook her head and laughed. Diana's favorite sport was free diving in the sea.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they first met, all of Diana's photos were of whales, sharks, sea turtles, and corals.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie waited downstairs for Steven for several hours, but he didn't come out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked her assistant to keep an eye on Jace's news. She wanted to see him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before going, she asked her assistant to find a woman. She wouldn't let Jace touch her, but she wanted to give him an illusion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were always more solutions than problems. Jace couldn't escape her grasp.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At five in the afternoon, Diana came out of the sea. She used all her strength to pull the fishing net up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing more than ten big fish, Althea was shocked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She swallowed and looked at the crab that was twice the size of her face. "Diana, you're amazing. You even dared to catch such a big crab?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="322.html">« Prev</a><a href="324.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
