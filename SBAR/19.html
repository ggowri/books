The Marsh family was barely doing okay.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, the recent termination of cooperation with Azure Group made her look worried.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She didn&#x27;t understand. The cooperation with Azure Group was going well before. Why did Azure Group unilaterally cancel the collaboration?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Azure Group even canceled the cooperation with Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula felt a little uneasy again because of Diana&#x27;s words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff saw Steven and Queenie coming back and smiled lovingly, &quot;Queenie, Steven, does the Farley family have any requirements for cooperation?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smiled smugly, &quot;Dad, Mr. Farley has no demands. Diana pushed Madam Farley into the water. The Farley family requires Diana to apologize to them in front of everyone tomorrow.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff heard this and was furious. &quot;Humph! What a disgrace! She only knows how to cause trouble. I shouldn&#x27;t have taken her back in the first place.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;She plotted against you and Madam Farley. It is a waste of air for such a person to live.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was frightened at those words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the past, she hadn&#x27;t suspected Jeff, and she would have joined him in scolding her daughter. But now, she suddenly discovered that Jeff actually wanted his daughter to die.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her mind was filled with doubts.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;Diana was right when she said that Jeff has the opportunity to intervene in the three major medical agencies in Capitole.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I could only go to other places for paternity tests.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">In order to avoid Jeff&#x27;s suspicion, she said coldly, &quot;Jeff, you are right. I shouldn&#x27;t have brought her back. She grew up in the countryside and couldn&#x27;t be presentable. I made Queenie so sad.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry. I will never let her into this house again, so as not to embarrass us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff looked at her and looked distressed. &quot;It&#x27;s okay for us. But Steven has to face Diana every day. She&#x27;s so vicious. It&#x27;s really difficult for Steven.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula was suddenly stunned. It was evident that Jeff was making Steven hate Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He just wanted to make Queenie marry Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But that year, Queenie had sneaked away because Steven was in a car accident, leaving his legs crippled and blind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Queenie hadn&#x27;t run away, the person who married Steven would have been Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven watched the three insulting Diana in unison. He hadn&#x27;t thought it was a big deal before. But today, it sounded particularly harsh.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought of Diana&#x27;s expression as she took good care of him every day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought of the scene in which she read financial reports to him vividly when he couldn&#x27;t see, encouraging him to persevere. He stood up irritably, his voice becoming increasingly cold. &quot;I&#x27;m going home first.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff looked at Queenie. &quot;Queenie, hurry up and send Steven off. You two will be a couple soon.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said with a smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Paula looked at his smile and suddenly felt it was irritating.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;On the night of Queenie&#x27;s birthday party, it was a play directed and acted by Queenie herself that framed Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So what happened before...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula didn&#x27;t dare to think further. They had never listened to Diana&#x27;s explanation, and they just believed whatever Queenie said.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She suddenly felt a sharp pain in her heart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula thought, &quot;Could it be that I was blinded in the past?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="18.html">« Prev</a><a href="20.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
