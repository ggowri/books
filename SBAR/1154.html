Probably because they had a late-night snack tonight, Steven only prepared half a glass for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been used to drinking some milk before bed since childhood, so she could sleep well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, Steven would mock her when he saw her drinking milk every night, saying, "Haven't you weaned yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Diana was actually quite upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone has their own habits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her only habit was drinking a glass of milk before bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was because Diana didn't have her mom with her when she was little, and she could only fall asleep holding a bottle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Diana was at home, Leopold would instruct the servants to warm milk for her before bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The milk she drank was all sourced from the best farms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold always adored her, giving her the best of everything and arranging three older brothers to accompany her as she grew up, so she was loved by them from a young age.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold has always been selfless and kind. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's three elder brothers were also brought up very well by him. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana has lived a very good life except for the fact that she didn't have her parents by her side throughout her life.She drank the milk, got under the covers, and lay down to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very sleepy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't know when she fell asleep; when she became conscious, she only felt short of breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body was being pressed down, and she felt very uncomfortable. She finally sensed something was wrong, forced her eyes open, and saw Steven's deep eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven kissed her awake and whispered, "Diana, didn't you say you'd wait for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was startled awake by the desire in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shifted her uncomfortable body slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her pajama collar was pulled open, revealing her chest and faint kiss marks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze was deep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm very sleepy." Diana, who was woken up, was unhappy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could have slept until dawn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and moved slightly away from her, afraid she might feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She always had a faint, fresh fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the time of Steven's car accident, he couldn't sleep all night. Thanks to the medicine she prepared, he was able to fall asleep quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him. He had just bathed and carried a faint floral scent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used her body wash, which had a very pleasant scent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not sleeping yet?" she asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her breasts. H</span><span>e </span><span>could easily grasp</span><span> them by</span><span> one hand </span><span>, and a gentle squeeze would excite her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really enjoyed squeezing her breasts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's hand gently caressed her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very shy. Their first time, she was dazed, but she still remembered the feeling transitioning from pain to pleasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, she was very tired but completely awake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven," she said in a sweet, charming voice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong?" he asked, obsessively kissing her cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was not only handsome but also had a great physique. Diana really liked his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body was scorching hot, and his abs were very sexy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was drawn to him, leaning into his arms, too shy to look up at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "Don't be shy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His fingers stroked her waist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's body stiffened. She looked at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her shy appearance gradually drove him crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leaned close to her softest spot, gently stroking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana warned, "Steven, stop."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't want to stop; he really liked her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the sound she just made was very seductive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's hand around his waist slid gently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's whole body tensed up. That faint sensation made him feel hot and restless all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven kissed her lips, laughing at her naive thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just wanted to go further, not stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, are you feeling better?" he asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart trembled slightly at his gentle voice. She looked at him warily and asked, "What?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was momentarily confused, then grew even shyer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She understood Steven's meaning and refused to answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not good. Sleeping." Diana didn't want to bother with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled softly. Seeing her expression, he knew she was feeling much better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He whispered in her ear, "Darling, I'll be gentle to make it a better experience for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not giving Diana a chance to refuse, Steven domineeringly kissed her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said he would be gentle, but in the end, he forgot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That night, Diana's voice became hoarse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana broke down. Steven, insatiable, made her surrender completely again and again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half a month passed in happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's construction site started work today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana went to the construction site with Nolan early in the morning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are many things to pay attention to on the first day of work at the construction site.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had Olivia carefully choose the start date.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia said there would be some small issues, but they could be resolved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven wasn't at ease, so he decided to go along too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew he was very experienced in this field. His company has an excellent construction team. She didn't refuse his company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them arrived at the construction site entrance, only to see a crowd gathered there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie also regained memories of her past life. She knew very well how valuable this land would be after development.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie currently doesn't have much cash flow and can only arrange for someone to stop their construction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was already prepared. Sure enough, someone came to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan said, "Diana, those people don't look like good guys. One of them, the man in the leather jacket, seems to be the leader."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave the leading man a cold glance. He bore some resemblance to Elroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go and take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This land now belongs to Diana; there shouldn't be any trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The project manager saw Nolan, quickly walked up to him, and said, "Mr. Watson, I was just about to call you. That gentleman says this construction site is his. What's going on?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1153.html">« Prev</a><a href="1155.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
