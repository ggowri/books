This late awakening and apology mean nothing to me. I hope you truly repent and learn to value your future," Diana said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry, Diana. I know I've let you down. You came back so happy, but we listened to Queenie when she said you'd take away the love she received from her brothers," Gale said tearfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just because of those words, the four of us treated you so harshly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale wept as he thought of the brother who loved Diana dearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That man showered Diana with immense affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As her biological brother, he had never spoken a kind word to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about it, Gale found himself frightening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze toward Diana had always been disdainful, and his words always hurtful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more Gale thought about it, the more he realized how awful he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie and Jeff always blamed Diana first, favoring the ones they loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana scoffed coldly. "Gale, I told you in the hospital I'd never forgive you. You believed Queenie when she said everyone preferred my face to yours, so you had someone use corrosive chemicals to destroy it. Do you have any idea how much that hurt?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"While I was in agony, you were all comforting Queenie. You people are heartless. I will never forgive you in this life. Get lost!" Diana shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After shouting, Diana hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The phone slipped from her hand as she crouched on the floor, hugging herself tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly recalled her past life. After being disfigured, she had lost all hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She only thought of Tobias back then, believing he would never harm her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tobias always adored her. Even a small scratch on her hand would make him worry for hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Julius was always gentle, baking cakes and cooking dishes to cheer her up when she was sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hubery was the saddest part. After arriving at the Marsh family, Hubery saw her being bullied in a restaurant and asked why she chose such a life. Smiling, she said, "Hubery, I have parents now. It's just a misunderstanding. Once it's resolved, they'll treat me well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hubery looked at her with disappointment. "Diana, I saw what happened. That girl bullied you, and no one stood up for you. How can you be happy in such a household?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The day after she married Steven, Hubery left for abroad and hasn't returned since.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana returned to her room, hugging herself as she sat on the floor, crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She seemed to hear her past self crying out from the abandoned building. "Someone, please save me. It hurts so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, she had lost all hope in the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had given her all in her relationship with Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even wondered if her downfall was due to her own greed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She already had a loving grandfather and three doting brothers, so perhaps this was her karmic retribution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only in this new life did she realize it wasn't true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Queenie and Jeff's ambition, and Queenie's twisted personality, that led to her suffering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was sheltered by her grandfather and brothers' love in her past life, unaware of the cruel world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why she had rushed into another family bond and love so fervently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But human nature could be surprising. She finally understood the saying.&nbsp;Nothing is colder than the human heart, nothing cheaper than love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Late awakenings and apologies weren't worth forgiveness. No matter how you patch up something broken, cracks remain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd rather have missed the Marsh family and Steven than meet them again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, Diana had the same nightmare from her past life.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="249.html">« Prev</a><a href="251.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
