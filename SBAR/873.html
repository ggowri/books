"Of course, I meant it. When have I ever gone back on my word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold gleam flashed in Queenie's eyes. "Good. I'll come find you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, she thought, "Levi, if you're heartless, don't blame me for being ruthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She planned to use Levi to elevate her position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Levi replied smoothly. "Come to the villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Queenie lay back down on her bed to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana and Tom finished their lunch and packed three more lunches to bring back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Diana delivered one to Paige, then carried another to Luna and Evan, who shared the same hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana walked in, she found Steven sitting silently on a chair beside Evan's bed. His still figure resembled a lonely mountain, and even his back radiated solitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This version of Steven stirred a faint ache in her heart, much like he had in countless nights of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood him in some ways. His painful upbringing had left him with little else besides hate, save for the meager warmth Queenie had given him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could see why he treated Queenie well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Queenie had been there for him in some small way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But teaming up with Queenie to frame her... That had gone too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had always been kind to Evan, treating him like a true friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a little surprised. "You didn't eat dinner yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at the boxes in her hands and shook his head slightly. His voice was hoarse. "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had brought back enough for three people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was still unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and Luna can eat first," Steven said softly. "When Evan wakes up, I'll get him something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's emotions were complex as he observed Diana. Diana was very calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Does that mean she not cares me anymore?" Her indifference stung more than anger ever could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled in self-mockery. The most brutal coldness was to disregard someone completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Diana was ignoring him. Her mild manner wasn't kindness; it was the absence of any need to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Steven murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His deep gaze lingered on her, but her serene face gave nothing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't notice his look. She opened the food boxes and handed one to Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven quietly ate his portion on the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna seized the chance to ask, "Diana, could I switch to another room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and shook her head. "There's been an influx of patients this year. No extra rooms are available. Once your IV finishes, you'll be free to go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna glanced at Evan. "When will he wake up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven also turned his gaze to Diana, waiting for her response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked over and examined Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only running a fever. Once it subsided, he would wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to timely medical attention, there would be no lasting complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's fine. He'll wake up tonight. I'll head to the lab to prepare some medicine for you both. The cold seawater might leave some lingering effects. I probably won't be back until tomorrow. Luna, after your IV, could you keep an eye on Paige? I'm worried something might happen to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna frowned. "Diana, she..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Steven, hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Luna eventually nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana picked up her bag. "I'm leaving now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her go and stood to follow her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna rolled her eyes at his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt he was shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," Steven called out. "You're exhausted. Rest tonight and go to the lab tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she was avoiding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deliberately, he added, "I'll stay here with Evan tonight. I'm not going home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face remained impassive. "I'm not tired. I'm heading to the lab now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were curt, her tone icy, as frigid as the winter wind outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their roles had reversed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's indifference toward Steven now mirrored how he had once treated her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her retreating figure and smiled. "Diana, I know you too well. We'll return to how things were two years ago. You'll take care of me again. We'll get along peacefully like we did back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited until she entered the elevator before returning to the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna shot him a cold look but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sat down and resumed eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his meal, he turned to Luna. "Luna, where is Diana's lab?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna glared at him, livid. "Why should I tell you? So you can hurt her again? Haven't you done enough damage today? I can't fathom why you refuse to divorce her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana is incredible. Without you dragging her down, she'd thrive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes turned frosty. Luna's furious expression didn't faze him. He knew he had made mistakes. "Luna, can't I have a chance to make things right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Luna snapped. "Diana doesn't even want her own mother. Why would she want a jerk like you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, let the past go. Diana cared for you sincerely during those two years, but that can't compare to the bond you share with Queenie. She's your childhood sweetheart You should set Diana free and marry Queenie. People move forward, not backward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna usually didn't interfere in such matters. She believed Diana's decisions were her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after what Steven had done today, Luna couldn't stay silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, how far must you go to hurt Diana before you'll let her go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to ask why he treated Diana this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana saved your life, and yet you repay her with betrayal. Mr. Gellar, as president of the Gellar Group and a graduate of the most prestigious economics university, why are you so determined to ruin Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled. He knew the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear to leave her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized it was too late for him to learn the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I realized it too late. Is that a reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was deep, steady, and laced with faint amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That smile on his handsome face was unreadable, leaving Luna utterly perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Realizing it too late?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does he mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna stared at him, baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt Steven seemed different. He wasn't as cold as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Luna hadn't interacted with him much in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her impression of him remained poor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven spoke again. "Luna, I heard you're quite skilled with computers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna frowned. "Who told you that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled. "I overheard when Diana called you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's eyes widened. "You eavesdropped on Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shook his head. "Not intentionally. I happened to hear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what?" Luna demanded, her patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's tone softened. "Luna, I had nothing to do with what happened today. Queenie's design wasn't from me. That was a limited-edition design from my company. Why would I give it to her for a competition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned forward slightly. "I'll pay you a million dollars. Investigate how Queenie got the design. If I investigate her, she'll be on guard. But She won't suspect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna froze, sensing ulterior motives. "You'd really investigate Queenie?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="872.html">« Prev</a><a href="874.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
