Diana said coldly, &quot;Penelope, you are Gale&#x27;s fiancée. He is in the hospital now, but you are here so carefree. Your love is nothing more than this.&quot;</p><p>Penelope sneered. She would not spend energy to take care of a cripple. &quot;A useless cripple can&#x27;t even take care of me. I&#x27;m not his fiancée.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s such a pity. Half a year ago, you and Queenie tried so hard to plot against Althea and me, but now you have nothing,&quot; Diana said in a sarcastic tone.</p><p>Penelope was the person Queenie kept restraining Gale.</p><p>Penelope&#x27;s face turned pale. She had tried hard at that time, and she had put a lot of thought into her plan again in the hotel three months ago.</p><p>But Gale suddenly became disabled. And she didn&#x27;t want to be with him for the rest of her life.</p><p>&quot;Hmph! What right do you, an orphan, have to say anything about me?&quot; said Penelope somewhat guiltily. But her child had to be born.</p><p>She had no chance of getting pregnant again.</p><p>Penelope wanted to be a mother in her life.</p><p>Even if the baby was not Gale&#x27;s, she wanted the Marsh family to raise him.</p><p>After making up her mind, she decided to go to the hospital to find Gale. Even if he was disabled, Paula could raise the child. And Penelope could still have fun.</p><p>Penelope walked to Diana, but Olivia didn&#x27;t give her a chance to speak. &quot;Stop making things difficult for Diana. Go to the hospital for a checkup. You are sick.&quot;</p><p>Penelope looked at Olivia angrily. &quot;Last time you said I was going to die, and this time you said I was sick. How did I offend you? Why do you curse me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are the one who is really sick,&quot; Penelope roared.</p><p>Olivia shook her head. &quot;It&#x27;s none of my business if you don&#x27;t believe me.&quot;</p><p>Penelope was confused. This woman was so weird.</p><p>Penelope said, &quot;Humph! Diana, your friend is weird and as vicious as you are. No wonder you were kicked out of the Marsh family.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Penelope, what are you doing here?&quot;</p><p>It was Steven and Queenie.</p><p>Diana felt even more disgusted when she saw them.</p><p>Steven was very generous. He knew that there was truth to all the things that happened to Queenie, but he still chose to forgive Queenie.</p><p>Steven always preferred Queenie.</p><p>Diana glanced at Steven lightly and met his deep gaze. He was also looking at her.</p><p>She slowly moved away. In this life, she would not be as impulsive as she was in her previous life to blame Steven and Queenie for being close.</p><p>In this life, Diana was calm.</p><p>But Queenie and Steven had already come over.</p><p>Diana said helplessly, &quot;Olivia, let&#x27;s go to another place to eat.&quot;</p><p>Diana only wanted to enjoy her dinner. Queenie and Steven were her natural enemies.</p><p>Penelope then explained, &quot;Olivia, Mr. Gellar, I met Diana. I was kind to greet her, but her friends said I was sick.&quot;</p><p>Penelope felt wronged.</p><p>Olivia frowned with undisguised disdain and said, &quot;You are really sick. Venereal disease. Stay away from us.&quot;</p><p>Diana asked in a low voice, &quot;Olivia, how did you know that? Can you diagnose illnesses?&quot;</p><p>Olivia smiled, &quot;Diana, the secret cannot be revealed.&quot;</p><p>Diana felt aggrieved. Her curiosity was aroused, but she couldn&#x27;t hear the truth. She was aggrieved.</p><p>However, Penelope had had countless boyfriends since she was in high school. Penelope wanted to let her youth burn while she was still young.</p><p>She enjoyed her youth.</p><p>Penelope was afraid. Venereal disease?</p><p>She had slept with hundreds of men over the years, but she went to the hospital for regular checkups, so she comforted herself that she was fine.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="237.html">« Prev</a><a href="239.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
