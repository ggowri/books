If you think it&#x27;ll be too uncomfortable for you, you&#x27;re welcome to stay behind. After all, she is Queenie&#x27;s mother.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I did mention I&#x27;d marry Queenie, but that was before she saved my life. If she hadn&#x27;t saved me, I wouldn&#x27;t feel obligated to marry her. So there&#x27;s really no need for you to tease me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh, so now you can tell when I&#x27;m teasing? You&#x27;ve been the one teasing me this whole time!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s laughter was light and free, her vivacious spirit captivating Steven, making it hard for him to look away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Soon, they arrived at the eighth floor, where she spotted Amelie turning the corner toward the presidential suite.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Memorizing the room number, she turned back to Steven. &quot;Mr. Gellar, could you do me a favor?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a master key in hand, Steven raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing on his lips.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh? You sound so sweet and polite all of a sudden. Go ahead, tell me how you want me to help you. Just remember, I expect something in return.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana scrunched her nose, feeling annoyed. &quot;Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be my husband? Why do you want something in return?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Because you don&#x27;t actually need your husband&#x27;s help right now,&quot; Steven replied, clearly not in the mood to be overly generous.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He looked at her pointedly and added, &quot;Just take the child back to the nanny. I know what you&#x27;re up to. My card can open that door over there, but once this is over, we need to have a serious conversation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Bringing the baby along to catch them in the act could get messy if the child starts crying.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Faced with his teasing gaze, Diana felt at a loss for words. Deep down, she wanted him to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She asked Steven to wait while she took Harlan back to the nanny, promising to return quickly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As she prepared to leave, Steven wrapped his arm around her waist, his voice low and commanding. &quot;When we get in there, keep your eyes closed and don&#x27;t look at anything.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Feeling his strong presence, she frowned but didn&#x27;t protest.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was clearly waiting for her agreement.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Finally, she smiled and said, &quot;Alright, I promise I won&#x27;t look.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, Steven seized the opportunity, quickly opening the door while the wind outside howled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A crack appeared, and they were met with sounds that made Diana blush.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Having never witnessed such intimate moments between a man and a woman, she felt a wave of shyness wash over her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mark, take it easy! Why are you always so impatient?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How can I not be? Dealing with that bitch these past few days has taken a toll on me. Her parents refuse to give me the shares we discussed, and they&#x27;ve even halted my projects. Without their support, I can&#x27;t get anything done.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Isn&#x27;t that frustrating? I came to vent, after all.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As he thrust in, a painful gasp from Amelie echoed through the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven and Diana exchanged glances before instinctively stepping back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana pulled out her phone and began recording.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven swiftly covered her eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mark let out a satisfied sigh.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Amelie, you&#x27;re the best. This feels amazing. That nagging bitch? I really can&#x27;t stand her.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Good thing she&#x27;s already out of the picture. You better not treat me the way you treated your wife. We&#x27;ve known each other for most of our lives. If you dare to treat me like that, I&#x27;ll be the one to take you down,&quot; Amelie warned coldly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Relax, she is long gone. I took care of her myself. Once her body is discovered, her parents will probably die of anger, and then we can finally be together openly.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s heart sank. It turned out Lily had been killed by Mark.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="791.html">« Prev</a><a href="793.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
