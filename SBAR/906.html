This is her place. What does that have to do with you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s face turned red with anger. &quot;Diana, you...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her anger was rising fast.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you better watch your...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">But before she could finish, Helen cut her off.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you&#x27;re here!&quot; Helen smiled brightly when she saw Diana. &quot;I was just thinking of coming to see you this afternoon. I can&#x27;t stay at the manor anymore. I think I&#x27;ll move in with you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wanted to leave so Steven could have a chance to visit her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The accident had made everything so rushed, and Evan hadn&#x27;t called, which meant something had happened to him too.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;That sounds great, Grandma. I&#x27;ll feel better knowing you&#x27;re with me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia gently pushed Diana inside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew glared at Diana, his voice cold. &quot;Diana, you&#x27;ve got one day to return everything our family owns.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana played innocent, pretending she didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about. &quot;What assets? Are you getting old and forgetful? Those assets are mine. They&#x27;re joint property between me and Steven. The agreement is clear. If he cheats, I get everything in the divorce.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If you want to blame someone, blame your idiot son. He knew exactly what he was signing and still put his name on it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Now the assets are under my name, and that makes them mine. When did they become yours?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re unbelievable. You&#x27;re just flat-out stealing.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Andrew was so angry he couldn&#x27;t even speak, just glaring at her in frustration.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smirked and turned to George. &quot;Steven, you gave me all that willingly. Why are you and your dad now coming here, making a scene in front of Grandma? You signed that agreement without a second thought, and now you&#x27;re acting like this? You&#x27;re pathetic.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Look at you. You cheated with Queenie, and that&#x27;s bad enough, but she doesn&#x27;t even like you. She&#x27;s cheated with more than one man, and it&#x27;s not just Levi...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was livid. She never thought Diana, usually so mild, would be this sharp-tongued in front of her. She quickly interrupted, voice shaking with fury. &quot;Diana, shut up! How can you be so vile?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh, I&#x27;m just learning from you! You&#x27;ve called me evil so many times. Now I&#x27;m just taking a page out of your book.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie glared at Diana, stepping back in anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t understand why Diana always showed up at her worst moments to rub salt in her wounds.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George&#x27;s expression darkened as he watched Diana. He realized he had seriously underestimated her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie couldn&#x27;t stop herself anymore. &quot;Diana, you...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Diana cut her off again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, I&#x27;ve been putting up with you just to get the divorce. But now that it&#x27;s done, I&#x27;m done with you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana scoffed. &quot;Thanks to you all, I&#x27;ve learned not to rely on anyone. But trust me. I can definitely vent all my frustrations on you. My life&#x27;s hard enough. What makes you think you deserve to have it easy?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You love kicking people when they&#x27;re down, don&#x27;t you? Always want to make things worse for me?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven loves you so much, right? So why did he give all his assets to me?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, you&#x27;re so overconfident. You still haven&#x27;t figured out how the real world works. No one ever taught you how to see things for what they really are, did they?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Just remember this. From now on, if I need to be ruthless with you, I will. And if I need to hold back, I&#x27;ll never do that.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s eyes widened as she looked at Diana, who stood there with a commanding presence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everything had been going according to their plan, so why was this happening?</p><p style="text-align:left;">They didn&#x27;t even manage to get Paula&#x27;s company.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And as for Steven, everything was supposed to be under control. They were so careful, yet here they were, with nothing to show for it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was furious, but words failed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana glanced at the three of them, her gaze eventually landing on George. &quot;Where&#x27;s Evan? Why isn&#x27;t he with you? And why can&#x27;t I reach him?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George coldly replied, &quot;He leaked company secrets. I had him arrested last night.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s suspicions about Evan were right all along.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her eyes filled with unshed tears, and she pointed accusingly at Steven. &quot;Steven, you disgusting, vile, shameless excuse for a man. People like you deserve nothing less than to be dragged to the deepest, darkest pit. You should be skinned alive and torn apart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re heartless and ruthless, just like a snake. You and your mistress deserve to be publicly humiliated, to be torn to shreds for everything you&#x27;ve done.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ll be there, watching as you both get what&#x27;s coming to you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Evan was your friend! He saved your life more times than I can count, and now you just throw him to the wolves? He stands up for me, and this is what happens?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, Queenie, I hope you two rot together forever. I wish you both a lifetime of misery and pain, and I hope you never get an ounce of genuine happiness.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana finished her tirade, feeling a sense of relief she hadn&#x27;t realized she&#x27;d been carrying.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She&#x27;d been waiting for this moment for so long.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now, her worry was palpable. She had no idea where Steven was, and finding Evan was her only chance to understand what had happened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie and George stood frozen, their faces dark with disbelief, staring at Diana in utter shock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie, voice hoarse with fury, stormed toward her, shouting, &quot;Diana, I&#x27;m going to make you regret this. How dare you curse us like that?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her face was flushed with rage, her forehead veins bulging, her makeup doing nothing to mask her fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She raised her hand, aiming to slap Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Olivia quickly moved the wheelchair back, and Queenie, with all her force, lost her balance and crashed to the floor, landing at Helen&#x27;s feet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie stared up at Helen&#x27;s shoes, humiliation washing over her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She cried out in frustration, &quot;Diana, how can you humiliate me like this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana, motioning for Olivia to push her closer, looked down at Queenie with a smirk. &quot;What? You can&#x27;t take a little humiliation? What about all the things you&#x27;ve done to me before?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="905.html">« Prev</a><a href="907.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
