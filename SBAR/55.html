When the Gellar family was facing bankruptcy, I was busy with the company's affairs and couldn't take care of you. It was Diana who saved you. She knew you loved Queenie and didn't want you to feel guilty, so she asked me to keep it a secret."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen continued, "Now that you've let Diana go, just leave her be. Don't show up and remind her of the past. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Diana saw you and remembered how you treated her for Queenie's sake, she'd probably feel that even the air around you is dirty."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen hung up, leaving Steven to tighten his grip on the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Evan, pull over. Find out where Diana is. I need to see her," Steven ordered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan replied cautiously, "You could just call her, Mr. Gellar."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was silent; Diana had blocked his number.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Call her for me," he instructed, shooting Evan a cold glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan shivered, quickly pulling over to make the call. He tried twice, but Diana didn't answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling a bit embarrassed, Evan turned to Steven's stern face. Before he could speak, Steven barked, "Track her phone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan quickly attempted to locate Diana's phone and succeeded. "She's heading toward the suburbs. Should we follow her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded curtly. "Yes, follow her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Olivia drove Diana to a hot spring resort outside the city. As the car stopped in the parking lot, Diana felt her spirits lift at the sight of the surrounding mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting out, Olivia grabbed their suitcase from the trunk. "Diana, let's go. I've already made a reservation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great!" Diana said, taking in the beautiful scenery. The resort, nestled on a hillside, offered breathtaking views. Flowers and trees swayed in the gentle breeze, accompanied by the cheerful singing of birds. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, Diana felt she could leave her worries behind and enjoy the peace of nature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Olivia, I love it here! Let's hurry inside," Diana exclaimed, running ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia followed, pulling the suitcase along. They stocked up on snacks before checking in and heading to their room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After changing into swimsuits, they went to soak in the hot spring. The water was soothing, surrounded by pebbles and lush trees. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting playful shadows on the water's surface.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Settling into the pool, Diana sighed with contentment. "Wow, Olivia, this is bliss. I feel so relaxed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia was glad to see her friend happy. Diana had a way of letting go of her troubles, but her love life had been anything but smooth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting beside her, Olivia said, "Diana, I think I saw your ex-husband being cheated on recently."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana scoffed, "He's just Queenie's backup. Don't remind him. Queenie is his everything. Even if she's unfaithful, he'd still be her puppet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia looked surprised. "You already knew?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smirked, "I know more than that. But let's not talk about him. I cried over him before, but not anymore. Now, even his presence feels like pollution."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A month ago, I had a high fever and wanted him to take me to the hospital, to show some care. But one call from Queenie, and he left. It's happened countless times."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I moved from love to disappointment, to despair, and finally woke up. There's no future with him, so I've stopped expecting anything. My grandfather likes Alexander, and I'm considering giving that a try."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no intention of crossing paths with Steven again. She hoped Steven and Queenie would stay together, while she pursued a free and fulfilling life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia remarked, "You two are destined to have a complicated story, but it's not a happy one."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was done with heartbreak. "Olivia, marriage isn't for me. Once my business is settled, I'll leave and start fresh somewhere else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia understood her exhaustion. "When you're ready, let's travel the world together."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely. Traveling the world has always been my dream too," Diana agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Steven overheard the end of their conversation. He hadn't caught the part about being cheated on, but hearing Diana mention Alexander filled him with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quietly, he vowed, "Diana, we're not divorced yet, and you're thinking about other men. You're asking for trouble. You can't escape me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forty minutes later, Diana and Olivia returned to their rooms to rest. Diana had booked separate rooms for privacy. After a relaxing soak, they were ready for a good night's sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half-asleep, Diana heard the door open and assumed it was Olivia. "Olivia, I'm almost asleep. What did you forget?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no response.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood by the bed, watching her. She lay there, her skin glowing from the hot spring, her curves accentuated by her light clothing. Her beauty was undeniable, and he couldn't help but be captivated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her long lashes rested gently on her cheeks, and her lips were slightly parted, adding to her allure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Steven's desire grew, Diana sensed something was wrong and opened her eyes to see him standing there.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="54.html">« Prev</a><a href="56.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
