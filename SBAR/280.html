She knew Cecil had a penchant for playing pranks on people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two men looked bewildered, with one of them asking, "Who's Cecil? Your enemy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was taken aback, thinking, "Isn't it Cecil?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he was the only one she could think of who would have a motive to do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Queenie was slapped hard across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She screamed, shocked and fearful. From childhood to adulthood, she had never been struck by anyone except for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Such an annoying voice," remarked one of the men with a disgusted expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's self-esteem was hurt. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? You're a woman, so we won't hit you," the man said, lifting the hand he had used to strike Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Infuriated, Queenie retorted, "Haven't you already hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she finished speaking, the man landed another slap on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears welled up in Queenie's eyes from the anger within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a step back, fear gripping her as the man glared at her with a deadly purpose. "Don't be scared. We just wanna break your hands," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie clenched her fists tightly, bewildered. "What are you doing? Why do you want to break up my hands? I've done nothing to you. This is going too far."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a piano competition next month. It was crucial for Queenie as it was her gateway into the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was specially organized for her by Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Were you sent by Diana?" Queenie asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Only Diana is aware of my dream of entering the entertainment industry and the significance of this competition to me. But Diana is quite foolish. She won't act unless provoked openly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who's Diana? We don't know her, but we know about you. You just graduated. Remember who you impersonated to get into that piano competition?" the man sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was taken aback, staring at them in shock. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just couldn't stand you, a vicious woman, so I deliberately caused trouble for you. Remember Callie Hayes? You took away everything from her just because she had no money and power,"  the man said with a grin before delivering a punch to her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie let out a piercing scream, feeling pain all over her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man glanced at her coldly. "Stop screaming. So harsh. Callie is gone, all because of you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, you used your power and tricks to steal her championship. You'll rot in hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on over there?" came a policeman's voice suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing the police, the two men quickly escaped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police immediately chased after them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie only dared to breathe a sigh of relief once the men were out of sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clutching her chest, gasping for air, and feeling the pain on her face, she was oddly pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She broke into a fit of maniacal laughter, reveling in Callie's death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Callie gone, the secret would remain buried forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's features contorted, and her ambition was fully revealed in the darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beneath the dark sky, she sobbed and cackled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gazed at the villa area not far away. This was her dream, his dream, and their shared dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could only live here when Steven lived here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This villa area symbolized wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to pass by it and take a peek every day because Steven lived there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Steven no longer wanted her. She knew exactly why she had worked so hard to move up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Trembling, she said, "Steven, I will make you do whatever I want for the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, Queenie laughed hysterically.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="279.html">« Prev</a><a href="281.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
