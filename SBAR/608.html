When you're 60 years old, you can sue me. Whatever the court decides to give you in alimony, I will pay. That's the only responsibility I can fulfill as your daughter. You never raised me, so why should I take care of you in your old age? You know exactly how I was abandoned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face turned pale, thinking, "How did she find out? Back then, Amelie wanted to strangle her to death. I couldn't bear to see it happen. After all, she was my daughter, so I just threw her away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Jeff gritted his teeth, not continuing, afraid that the more he spoke, the more he would be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't give him the chance to talk and left the lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was furious, his face darkened. Watching Diana's ruthless retreating figure, he bellowed, "Heartless wench, I should have strangled you to death back then to stop you from growing up and becoming a nuisance. You have money, why can't you give me some?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, walking to the door, suddenly turned back and said, "Actually, you killed me once back then. You just failed. You intended to kill me, but you couldn't bear to see me die in your hands, so you threw me away. Do you know how I came to my current family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because my grandfather witnessed you abandoning me, that's why you found me so easily. Otherwise, do you think you could have found me with your limited abilities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've always known how I was abandoned, but for that ridiculous family affection, I returned to your home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You came to me for your own benefit, and I endured it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven had a car accident and became blind and disabled. Queenie disliked Steven, so she ran away. I married Steven instead, stabilizing your shaky company for a few more years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't what I've done enough? Yet how have you treated me? Everyone has humiliated me, trying every means to kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you and Queenie are really something, even hiring someone to kill Frank. As Frank's father, aren't you afraid of his ghost coming for you? After all, he's your biological son, and you actually had the heart to kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you've already started to suffer repayment, haven't you? Your eyes and your lungs are starting to have problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of thinking about how to take things from others, you should think about how to cure your illness. This chronic disease will get worse over time until you can't leave your bed. What do you think your abandoned four sons will do to you after you have a stroke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will Queenie, who was pampered and grown up by you, take care of your basic needs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was furious, his eyes wide open. "You bitch, dare you curse me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ignored him and had the bodyguards throw </span><span>him</span><span> out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Paula had saved the company, she wouldn't yield any more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Paula was her mother, so Diana decided to endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff watched Diana leave, dumbfounded, thinking, "She knows everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Eric were thrown out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff cursed angrily, "Eric, I asked you to persuade Diana, but why didn't you say a word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled and said, "She doesn't listen to what you say, so how could she listen to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm earning 3,000 a month now. My words carry little weight. I just came to have a look."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="607.html">« Prev</a><a href="609.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
