Why was he afraid of nightmares?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was sleepy, so she lay down beside Cecil's bed and continued to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her and said with a serious look, "Diana, are you really going to sleep here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice and expression were cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tone was calm. "Yeah, what if Cecil is frightened awake? No one will comfort him."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven choked. "He's a grown man and doesn't need you to comfort him."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana suddenly smiled. Her eyes were bright. "Steven, aren't you the best at comforting people?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can make Queenie very happy. Poor girl. She was bullied yesterday, but you didn't comfort her. I guess she will come to you to cry tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana imitated Queenie's way of crying. "Steven, I was sad last night. Why didn't you come to accompany me? Do you care about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana made a face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were bloodshot with anger. He felt upset and could only clench his fists. He clenched his fists and breathed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was cold, and he spoke without thinking in a fit of anger, "You really can't compare with her. At least she knows how to act coquettishly."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a little pain in her heart. Her eyes gradually darkened, and she laughed at herself. "Yes, how can I compare to your Queenie, who is so lovely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was stunned, looking at Diana's sad eyes. He was just trying to satisfy himself for a moment and hurt Diana again. He quickly apologized, "Sorry, that's not what I meant."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "No matter what you mean, I know she is irreplaceable in your heart. Just divorce me quickly and live a happy life with your lover."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath and said, "I was young and ignorant, too irrational, and didn't listen to my family's advice, which is why I got entangled with you for so many years. Now I have changed my mind and will not disturb your life anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt helpless. It was getting harder for him to talk to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ignored the pain in her heart and continued to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in Steven's heart was so dense and sharp that he stared at her back intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't mind Diana continuing to disturb his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita stood at the door, looking at the three inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven used to treat Queenie as a treasure, but now he had discovered the good of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Needless to say, Rita liked Diana very much. Diana was the same age as Cecil, and they got along very well. Sometimes, Rita really hoped that Diana could accompany Cecil all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita shook her head slightly and gave up. She could not force them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fell asleep. She liked to sleep on snowy days.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated being called out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven heard her even breathing and laughed out of anger. He thought, "She can really fall asleep. Does she really think Cecil won't do anything to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or does she trust Cecil from the bottom of her heart?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, she didn't trust me and locked the door of the room."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's perfect face looked even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing that she was sleeping uncomfortably, he stood up, walked over, and found that Cecil held Diana's hand uneasily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Steven wanted to kill Cecil.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="669.html">« Prev</a><a href="671.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
