It's a little overwhelming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor, a short-haired middle-aged woman, smiled warmly, "Here on our little island, we allow family members to be present during the birth. You can even witness the miracle of your baby coming into the world. In the city, you'd have to wait until after the birth to meet the little one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, understanding that every place had its own set of rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Althea, who had a smooth delivery, was all set, the doctor having taken care of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an IV drip in one hand, Althea was able to walk back to her room with Diana cradling the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really that simple to have a baby here," Althea remarked, still in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain had subsided, and she was astonished to see her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she looked at him, a frown crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, he looks way too much like Gale."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wore a smile. "Althea, no matter who he resembles, he's your child. You'll find someone who loves you even more in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You're right. Life has to throw some happiness my way eventually," Althea replied, her eyes lighting up as she gazed at her son, warmth flooding her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once back in the room, Althea lay down to continue her IV drip, exhaustion washing over her, and she quickly drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby settled beside her, sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched them, a smile gracing her lips as she thought, "Althea, you deserve to be happy forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing the baby would soon wake up hungry, she stood up to heat some water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, hurried footsteps echoed down the corridor, catching Diana's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the door to find several nurses rushing past in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana called out, grabbing one of the nurses, "What's going on? Why is everyone in such a hurry at this hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse, who had spoken briefly with Diana earlier in the delivery room, replied, "Miss, it's nothing to worry about, but the woman in room 408 just had her baby... and someone's stolen him! It's the child of a government official from this island. Now everyone's in a frenzy looking for the baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stolen? This island is tiny! How could anyone get away with that?" Diana asked, puzzled. She mused, "What on earth would possess someone to steal a baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse said, her voice tinged with urgency, "I wish I knew. It's chaos out there. With the snow and rain, it's a mess. We have to help look for the baby. Just keep an eye on your little one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a small hospital, and our security isn't great. The cameras in that delivery room were broken and haven't been fixed yet, so we have no idea who took the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the nurse dashed away, leaving Diana in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Room 408? Penelope?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Penelope was lurking around Althea's room, planning to snatch her baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Why are other innocent children suffering because of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana returned to Althea, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then again, Penelope knows Althea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she were to steal a baby, Penelope would have to be sure it was Althea's to use it as leverage against her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could there be someone else behind this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Althea's phone began to ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana rushed over and answered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, if you want to save your child, you'll need to come up with 10 million dollars." A voice on the other end sneered, dripping with arrogance.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="562.html">« Prev</a><a href="564.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
