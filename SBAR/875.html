"They're staying on the same floor. Let's go together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, munching on her breakfast, responded with a muffled hum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the opportunity, Tom helped tidy her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair had grown longer, and her delicate features seemed even more refined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elevator quickly arrived at the floor where Luna and the others were staying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom headed toward Paige's room with the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige hadn't left last night, as Tom had insisted she stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still running a fever and needed another IV drip today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, still nibbling on her breakfast, entered the room as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's deep gaze softened when he saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing her pale complexion, he frowned slightly. "Why do you look so unwell? Didn't you sleep last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana could respond, Luna interjected. "Mr. Gellar, Diana was up all night preparing medicine for Evan. She not has a poor rest. She's no rest at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's frown deepened. "You shouldn't do that. You can't keep doing this to yourself. No more staying up all night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at him, puzzled by his concern. "Why not? Don't act like you care about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit Steven like a slap. He realized that even his concern seemed fake to her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew he had pushed her away with his own hands, and he could only bear the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana handed the medicine to Luna. "Take this, it'll help dispel the cold from your body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna smiled brightly. "Thank you, Diana. The seawater was freezing. I'm sure it would have left a lasting chill if not for you. Your medicine fixes everything in just one dose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave her a faint smile, then turned to Evan. "Evan, take this as well. You've got fatty liver disease, so you'll need to be more mindful of your diet. Once we're back, I'll prescribe a treatment plan for you. Stick to it for a while, and it should improve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan beamed. "Thank you, Ms. Bishop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handing him the medicine, Diana sat down and resumed eating her breakfast. It had been a while since she'd had a croissant, and it tasted divine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, if you have medicine to dispel the cold, why didn't you give any to your sister? She fell into the sea too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's voice came from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had almost forgotten about him. "What is he doing here again?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him stood Queenie, looking pale as a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff didn't look much better. He had let himself go entirely. He's now overweight and unkempt, with none of his former authority. He was now just an ordinary old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but wonder again, "Is this man really my father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked in the mirror every day and questioned this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found no trace of him in her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pausing mid-bite, she glanced at Jeff and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt their audacity truly knew no bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I don't have a sister. You must have come to the wrong place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was ice-cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hadn't expected Diana to have medicine for the cold. With the chill now deeply rooted in her body, even affecting her fertility, she couldn't afford to miss out on such a cure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, no matter what, you and Queenie are sisters. She's unwell and needs the medicine just as much. Are you really going to stand by and do nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Diana suddenly found her croissant much less appetizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered, "Where does he get the nerve to say such things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're so worried about your precious daughter, go buy medicine for her yourself. There are plenty of remedies out there. It's not hard to find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget what you and Queenie have done to me. How dare you take my medicine? Aren't you afraid I've poisoned it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie flinched at the mention of poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, the past was just harmless bickering..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harmless bickering? Queenie, you staged your own kidnapping, hired people to abduct me, and constantly smeared my name. You call that bickering?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you've taken shamelessness to a whole new level. Steven may pamper you, but I certainly won't. Get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't want to waste another word on them. They were ruining her good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, how can you be so cruel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Cruel? The cruelest people here are you two. But congratulations, you've ended up with nothing but an empty shell. Your son abroad should be furious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled as she took another bite of her croissant, casually dropping a bombshell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really did love croissants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff and Queenie froze, thunderstruck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff bellowed, "Diana, what do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it obvious? Your company's annual revenue of 30 million dollars mysteriously flows overseas. I looked into it. Your son in Aeloria started his own company, but just like you, he's all brawn and no brains. His business is floundering, and you've been plugging his financial holes year after year. But this year, it looks like you're out of cash...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and I uncovered something even more intriguing. Before Amelie married you, she was with Mark Foliot. Maybe you should get a paternity test to see if that son is really yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hadn't intended to dig into this. But after Queenie's recent behavior, especially her targeting Paige, she couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to let this rotten family implode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face darkened further. "What... what are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only hope was for his son abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know what he should do if his son abroad weren't his. He'd already severed ties with his five children here. All his hopes rested on that son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, seeing her father's face change dramatically, also felt panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother had always been adamant about sending her brother abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, all his expenses had been quietly covered by Jeff, siphoned from his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Paula hadn't caught on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, how do you know about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had gone to great lengths to keep it a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it wasn't hard. Madam Marsh and Sir Marsh are obsessed with their 'brilliant' grandson abroad. It's not exactly a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam Marsh practically shouts it from the rooftops that her precious grandson at abroad is her pride and joy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everything went as expected, that man would return this year. Jeff couldn't cover his debts anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned. He knew that if Diana knew, then Paula surely did, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hollow laugh echoed from behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff turned to see Gale sitting in his wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gale, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's mind raced. He thought, "Has Gale heard everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now realized that the joke was on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jeff Marsh, what a show. Your selfishness and shamelessness are unmatched. Was it fun taking advantage of my mother's kindness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your son is older than me, and your daughter is older than Diana. Balancing two families must be exhausting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale's tone dripped with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face twitched. Their father-son relationship was already in shambles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his son's sarcastic words, he was very upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gale, I did deceive your mother, but I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Jeff could respond, a cold voice cut through the air. "Jeff, you're truly despicable."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="874.html">« Prev</a><a href="876.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
