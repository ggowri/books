He was also tricked, but he shouldn't have raped me, right? I liked him at that time. But after that, he cursed me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie taught him very well, so he also became blind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Gale was in high school, his grades were terrible. In order to get him into a good high school, I stayed up late to organize his notes for him. I did a lot of things for him but never moved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I destroyed his innocence and made him feel sorry for Penelope. Later, I found out that he liked women, who were open-minded. He preferred to give unconditional love to Penelope. And my efforts were worthless to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From that day on, I gave up on him. If he dared to snatch my baby away, I would fight him to the death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea smiled confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was happy to see that Althea had really let it go. "Well! Althea, you will meet someone who loves you more in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea said, "Of course. I am a very good person. I wasted so many years on a jerk and learned a profound lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the last time. I will meet a good man who is willing to cherish me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea was lying on the bed, smiling brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and stood up to clean up the dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale rushed to the island as quickly as possible and heard the conversation between Althea and Diana. He wanted to push the door open, but he no longer had the courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the girl who loved him had already regarded him as a rapist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Althea's eyes, Gale was a piece of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was fooled by Queenie. Penelope had a straightforward personality, which deeply attracted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That morning, when he woke up and saw that the person on the bed was Althea, he was angry and cursed her with the most vicious words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Althea, are you that desperate? You are so shameless that you even drugged me. I had never loved you, but you're clinging to me like a whore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are such a slut. You ruined my innocence and made me feel sorry for Penelope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea looked at him coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned and in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up and yelled at the top of her lungs, "Gale, you were the one who walked into the wrong room last night. The thing I fucking regret most in my life is falling in love with a scum like you. You're garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so weird. I don't believe these words came from you. Don't worry. I'll just call last night my bad luck. From now on, you and I will never have anything to do with each other again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea slammed the door and left in anger, and Gale never saw her again after that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that he was a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale was in pain. He knew that if he went in now, Althea would be very angry. But he wanted to see her and the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he was wrong. Althea was a good girl. They grew up together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Penelope's evil side, he realized that Althea was good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gale didn't cherish Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the nurse behind him, trembling uncontrollably. "Let's leave the hospital first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The nurse pushed the wheelchair away.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="577.html">« Prev</a><a href="579.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
