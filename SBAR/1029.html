"Luna, it's okay. I know him. He won't hurt me. Wait outside. If there's anyone suspicious, be alert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna glanced at Steven worriedly. She felt that his deep eyes were somewhat familiar, but she couldn't remember where she had seen him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna left. She was confused, thinking, not knowing since when Diana knew a guy like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man was very handsome. So, if she had seen his face before, she would&rsquo;ve remembered him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven got in the car and closed the door. For a moment, they were isolated from the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat quietly in the car. Diana leaned on her pink pillow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long gotten over Steven. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just the two of them, but she wasn&rsquo;t as nervous and excited as she had been a year ago. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She died once and realized that love was not as important as herself. Her own well-being was the most important thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't say anything. She leaned against the window slightly, looking soft and sweet. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He missed her madly. It felt so comfortable to sleep with her in his arms. Without her, he couldn't sleep well. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke first, "Diana, your legs are not healed yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana recognized him at first sight, which made him very happy. Luna and Cecil didn't recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved him. And he knew he could always count on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew it was him at first sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked down at her legs and smiled. "I can walk, but it hurts. I don't want to suffer. </span><span>So</span><span> it's good to sit in a wheelchair, and it doesn't hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tilted her head to look at him. There was sweat in his thick hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed sarcastically, "It's a pity that you and Queenie didn't get together. You </span><span>two are still as stubborn as ever. It hurts to walk, but you want to act cool and pretend that nothing is wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your injury is much more serious than mine. If you don't pay attention, you may become disabled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked down at his legs. In fact, his legs were swollen and uncomfortable. But if he sat in a wheelchair, he would be too conspicuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you disappointed that I'm not with her?" Steven suddenly wanted to know the answer, but he felt that he had asked a stupid question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am. After all, you are the golden couple in everyone's eye." Diana replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's heart ached. He knew that she didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm sorry! If it wasn't for me that night, you wouldn't have been hurt." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, he kissed her forcefully, so he didn't pay attention to the car on the opposite side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't care about this. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I didn't have an accident that night, there would be an accident later. If you died, do you think they would let me go? I got my life back by accident. Let's not talk about this now. But you, Mr. Gellar, handed all your property to me. Aren't you afraid that I won't give it back to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bright eyes and beautiful smile resembled the stars in the sky, luminous and stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was momentarily lost in thought. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her. Her smile was pure and clean, and she faced everything with composure. She no longer cared about anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt a sharp pain in his heart. It was he who had caused her to become like this. He thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">So, she always felt this way back when I turned a blind eye to her feelings, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it's ironic. There are so many people around me, but I can only trust you. The person who was hurt the most by me is the one I trust the most. Diana, I believe in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Always.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned. Her calm heart seemed to be hit by a small stone, splashing ripples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her stay quiet, Steven went on, "Diana, you know my past and how dangerous things are around me. I knew you loved me, but I was too scared to love </span><span>you</span><span> back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I was 15, I overheard Andrew and Queenie talking behind the rockery and realized that any girl who loved me would get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew Queenie was trouble, but I felt grateful to her because she saved me from a fire. When Queenie started targeting you, I didn't step in because I was </span><span>afraid</span><span> you'd get hurt even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, I found out it was actually you who saved me from the fire. That's when any gratitude I had for Queenie disappeared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the photo from that time. If you hadn't shown me the photo, I might not have known until now that there was a man who looked exactly like me behind Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled bitterly, "Diana, how stupid was I to think that I was the one in control </span><span>of the situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned, thinking, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Did</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> he not respond to my feelings because he didn't dare?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that Queenie and Andrew both wanted her dead, she smiled bitterly. She fell in love with someone she shouldn't have and met him at the wrong time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked sideways and met Steven's guilty eyes, and she smiled with relief, "Steven, the past is no longer important. We met at the wrong time, but we ended our relationship at the right time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what reasons you had back </span><span>then,you</span><span> broke my heart. And you can&rsquo;t fix it. Steven, come back when you get better. I'll give you the company back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want anything from Steven, not even his company. She could earn her own money and had a brighter future ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled at him and said, "I helped you keep the company, but it's just a temporary fix. Andrew left </span><span>Capitole</span><span>, and he's definitely planning something big for when he returns." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guess you're waiting for him to make his move. I've been waiting for you to step up, too. I can team up with you to handle them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the least she could do for him since she once loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew she got him. He was thankful she was still willing to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was such a great girl, yet he still lost her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, thank you!" He realized that no words could ever make up for the pain he caused her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I was going to die after the car accident. I didn't want your love to be in vain. I didn't expect Queenie to come back. I knew what kind of person she was, but I didn't know she staged the kidnapping and framed you. That day I beat you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> I was heartbroken that day. You accompanied them to act, and gradually you also got into the play. I can understand your desire to live. But Steven, I stayed with you not to act with you, but because Madam Gellar was very good to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only after taking the last pill can your eyes be completely restored. You have given me 100 million dollars for those expensive pills. We are now even," Diana interrupted him with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had let go of the past. She would not immerse herself in the pain of the past, but it did not mean that she would forget them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was almost driven crazy by her eagerness to draw a line between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly pulled Diana's hand and said in a low and domineering voice, "Diana, can you give me another chance to love you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1028.html">« Prev</a><a href="1030.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
