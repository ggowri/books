When she saw the message from Lily, she smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed the peeled apple to Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gale, eat the apple and then have some pork ribs later. You need more protein during this period so that your wound can heal better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mom." Gale took the apple and ate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Paula send a message to Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mrs. Foliot, the best part is yet to come. Dogs biting dogs is the most exciting, but I'm looking after my son in the hospital, so I can't enjoy the show.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily: [It doesn't matter. I'm watching the show at Amelie's door. She grabbed your ex-husband and wouldn't let him leave. Jeff didn't want the bastard son to sponge on him and intended to leave. Amelie tried to stop him, and they had a big fight.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula: [Then I feel relieved. Mrs. Foliot, please take a video for me.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily: [I'll send it to you later.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smiled and put her phone aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale asked with a smile, "Mom, did something good happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smiled, "Good news. Jeff took away Mark's company. Mark has nothing now. These three people have finally become enemies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula warned him, "Gale, unfaithful men don't end up well. Take you, for example; it'll be hard for you to see your child. You broke Gigi's heart. She doesn't want to </span><span>come back, so you can't force her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leaving her alone is your last kindness to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale was unwilling to give up. He shook his head quickly and said, "Mom, I came to this hospital for surgery to stand up and go back to them as soon as possible. Gigi loves me so much, and we have a son, so she will forgive me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After I leave the hospital, I'll go to see her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale was anxious every day and prayed that he would get better soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula took a deep breath. His stubbornness distressed her. "Gale, why don't you understand? Gigi will never forgive you. You used the cruelest method on her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Queenie plotted against me." Gale interrupted Paula irritably. He didn't dare to think about it. If Gigi didn't forgive him, what was the point of curing his leg?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula knew he was stubborn, so she said earnestly, "Gale, Queenie had a part in it, but you made a mistake. Gigi loved you. After what happened, you didn't verify the truth as a grownup man. Instead, you accused her. She was disappointed by your distrust and viciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gigi didn't give birth to the child for you. She's too kind to hurt a life. It has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula also wanted Gigi to come back, but she knew the latter wouldn't do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale smiled and shook his head with tears in his eyes, saying in a sobbed voice, "So Mom, I'll try harder. I'm serious this time. I know my feelings now. I love Gigi the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula did not argue with him. It was too late for him to realize that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, her daughter would never forgive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Paula's eyes. She picked up her phone again and continued to look at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Queenie and George entered Amelie's villa, they heard her cursing. "Jeff, you bastard. You're a beast. How can you frame Mark and steal his company? You're heartless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie fought with Jeff just now, so both of them looked disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was followed by two bodyguards. He looked at her coldly and said, "Amelie, this is the consequence of betraying me. I was watching when you two had an affair every time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Amelie was shocked. "Jeff, you are such a bastard. Why did you do that? How gross."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had long lost interest in Amelie. He now had a new mistress, who was his former assistant. He had an affair with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Amelie cheated on him, he wouldn't keep her around to annoy himself. If Mark liked her, he would just give her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, thanks to you, I took Mark's company smoothly. Every time you went to bed with him, you talked about the company, and that allowed me to take advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your good daughter Queenie put on another good show with Jace. After I knew about your relationship, I started preparing for all this, and I made it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Foliot family went against each other. Someone else would take advantage of them even if Jeff didn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, you should never, ever, ever betray me!" Jeff was furious. Because of this woman, he had nothing and was left alone in his old age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I severed ties with my four sons just for the son you gave me, but in the end, even that son isn't mine. Amelie, I treated you well. How could you do this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's eyes were cold and filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was choked by his cold, murderous intent. She could hardly breathe and failed to utter anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was taking revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie didn't want things to go like this. She had wished to live happily with Jeff and make Paula jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help competing with Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Amelie didn't want to give up on Mark. Her greediness had put her in an awkward position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What angered her more was that Paula found out that Noah was not Jeff's son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had ruined her life and even made her experience the betrayal. Amelie shouted in frustration, "Jeff, it's Paula's fault. She planned all this. She has nothing, but how can she frame me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is taking revenge on me because you did something wrong to her. Jeff, I have lived in darkness all my life for you. How could you do this to me and take away everything from my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sneered and said mockingly, "Your son is an illegitimate son, the son in the dark. Do you think he can have everything? He's too stupid to manage the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He only knows how to have fun abroad and squanders my money every year. I reminded you before that I would take back all the money you got from me. Now I have taken it all back. I won't ask you to pay me back for raising the bastard. I'll just consider it as compensation for you. Take good care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Jeff spoke coldly, he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw George and Queenie at the door, he paused and looked at Queenie. "Queenie, I have done a paternity test, and you are indeed my daughter. Do you want to go with me or stay with your mother?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="944.html">« Prev</a><a href="946.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
