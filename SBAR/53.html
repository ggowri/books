She hailed a taxi and headed home. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, she felt she had to rely on Steven to achieve everything she desired. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you can't defeat me," she thought, determined to find a way to turn the situation around and make Steven completely despise Diana. Only then, she believed, would Steven choose to marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on her way back, Diana closed her eyes, still feeling the sting of Steven's words. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They cut deep, like a dagger piercing her chest. Olivia, sitting beside her, could see the pain etched on Diana's face and could only shake her head, knowing how deeply this hurt her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana reflected on the past. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always shown care for Steven, sending him warm messages and reminding him to eat, yet she rarely received any response. She had hoped her kindness would eventually touch his heart. But she was wrong. He seemed to care for no one but himself, leaving her with nothing but self-delusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once thought they would spend their lives together, enduring any hardship. But now, in this new life, she realized how exhausted she was. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her deep love had turned to repulsion. It struck her that even the most beautiful love could be depleted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After deciding to divorce, she felt no regrets, only relief. Her past experiences guided this decision. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her newfound freedom, she envisioned a bright future, one she had dreamed of many times. She knew these messy affairs could hold her back, but she wasn't afraid. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life, she realized, wasn't just about romantic love. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At twenty-four, she was vibrant and young, with no reason to waste her time on someone like Steven, who was four years older. In this relationship, she had never felt truly loved or cherished. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It ended tragically, with her unrequited love for Steven leading to her own demise and that of their unborn child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was someone who dared to love and hate, expressing her emotions boldly. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back, she felt angry and unwilling to accept how Steven had taken her feelings for granted, never respecting or caring for her. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On their wedding night, he had coldly told her, "Diana, I married you out of respect for our grandfathers, but I will never fall in love with you." After that, he left and later got into a car accident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For two years, she took care of him, tending to his every need, but he remained neglectful and indifferent. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It became clear she could never compete with Queenie. Whenever Queenie called, Steven would rush to her side without hesitation, always attentive and caring. That seemed like true love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Diana lived another life, she realized she would still feel the heartbreak of being ignored and unloved. But she reminded herself, "I can't dwell on this. I am strong, I am excellent, and I deserve someone who will love me completely."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her connection with Steven was complex; they had known each other for a long time. As she opened her eyes, she saw a message from Steven on her phone.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="52.html">« Prev</a><a href="54.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
