Women like Queenie were exactly his </span><span>type</span><span>&mdash;strong, passionate, irresistible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being with her always made him happy. They were, in fact, the perfect match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said softly, "Queenie, you did nothing wrong. It's the jealous ones who are to blame.</span><span> </span><span>Your ideas are the best. Your future</span><span>'</span><span>s yours to shape, no matter how tough it gets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You let go of what </span><span>you had to</span><span>, and </span><span>you</span><span> held on to what mattered. You did nothing wrong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Mario, Queenie had always been a fighter, constantly proving she could stand on her own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's just </span><span>&hellip;</span><span> sometimes her methods were wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Women who show vulnerability tend to win men's favor. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Men&mdash;especially powerful ones&mdash;loved women who admired them. Spoiling a woman they loved made them feel like kings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie knew this all too well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "Queenie, I'll be with you from now on. You're my woman. I won't let you fight alone. We</span><span>'</span><span>ve still got Chloe to work with. That</span><span>'</span><span>s our ticket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario's eyes gleamed with cunning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never saw it coming&mdash;Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s wonder drug, handed out for free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie wrapped her arms around his waist. "</span><span>Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s next product? It has to be ours,"</span><span> she said. </span><span>"Be smarter with Chloe. Get her a house or something. Make her happy enough, and she</span><span>'</span><span>ll do whatever you need."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario was devious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was ruthless when he had to be, but when it came to Queenie, he was all heart.</span><br><span>No one mattered more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario smiled gently and said, "Alright! Let's go, Queenie. Time to rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie knew Mario loved her the most. Keeping him by her side was her greatest advantage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan turning himself in was the last thing Eric </span><span>ever </span><span>expected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching him walk into the police car, Eric was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric stood outside the police car, staring in shock. "Dylan, why didn</span><span>'</span><span>t you run? Turning yourself in isn</span><span>'</span><span>t your style."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan looked at him and asked, "Eric</span><span>&hellip;</span><span>do you and Mom really think I</span><span>'</span><span>m that selfish?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric didn</span><span>'</span><span>t hold back. "Yeah. You</span><span>'</span><span>re just like </span><span>Dad</span><span>&mdash;selfish to the core. were always the same.</span><span> </span><span>I mean, you've been gone for years</span><span>, </span><span>and I</span><span> barely recognized you anymore</span><span>. But turning yourself in? That really surprised me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t sugarcoating it. There was no need to hide anything between brothers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan let out a bitter laugh. Now he finally understood&mdash;he was nothing but a joke in everyone</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Selfish? Maybe. But it wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t just me.</span><span> </span><span>It was greed. It was Queenie playing me. It was me being too damn stupid to see it coming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly turned serious. "</span><span>Tell</span><span> Mom and Diana</span> <span>... I</span><span>'</span><span>m sorry.</span><span> </span><span>I screwed up. I</span><span>'</span><span>m gonna change, Eric.</span><span> </span><span>When I get out, I wanna be like you. A real CEO. Someone who actually deserves it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan lowered his head, on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a second, he looked so small&mdash;just a lost kid, not the spoiled brat everyone knew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truth was, Dylan had never earned a thing in his life.</span><br><span>Never cared about anyone but himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted everything, fought for everything... but never had the guts to build anything real.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The police car drove away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Dylan looked up, Eric saw the glimmer of tears in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric was stunned. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People like them, born into privilege, living carefree lives, had never faced the darkest sides of the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It</span><span>'</span><span>s only after people like them get hurt that they truly understand what they want.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the price Frank and Dylan paid for it was far too great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the four brothers, Eric was the first to wake up, losing the least.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, even</span><span> staying close to Queenie, he still hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t found any evidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric stood there, </span><span>lost in thought, until someone broke his trance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eric, what are you thinking about? I</span><span>'</span><span>ve called you several times</span><span>.</span><span>" Paula said, frowning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric </span><span>blinked</span><span>, realizing he was crying.</span><span> </span><span>He hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t even realized he was tearing up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly wiped away his tears and said, "Mom, sorry. I</span><span>'</span><span>m just feeling a bit off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could have been better. Paula</span><span>'</span><span>s resources, connections, and wealth&mdash;they could</span><span>'</span><span>ve taken them farther than they ever dreamed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bad luck was entirely their own doing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula gently patted Eric's shoulder and said, "Eric, you</span><span>'</span><span>re doing great. You</span><span>'</span><span>ve been working so hard lately, and things will only get better for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She almost hit rock bottom before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No expectations, no disappointments.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the </span><span>darkest times</span><span>, she</span><span>'d found something strange</span><span>. Once you see the truth of things, silence becomes your companion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want anything now. She just hoped them safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go</span><span> home</span><span>." Paula turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric quickly caught up and asked, "Paula, don</span><span>'</span><span>t you want to ask about Dylan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula</span><span>'</span><span>s face was blank, her voice calm. "I saw </span><span>it all</span><span> earlier. Dylan</span><span>'</span><span>s come to his senses, and that</span><span>'</span><span>s enough for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked at Eric and said, "Eric, don</span><span>'</span><span>t play games. As long as you four stick together, you can overcome anything.</span><span> </span><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s how this family stays strong.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula hoped they would grow better and stronger</span><span>, knowing they'd get through whatever came their way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric nodded quickly. "I got it. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll do better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula sighed tiredly, "Good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t until the next morning that Diana found out about Dylan</span><span>'</span><span>s arrest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had just woken up when Luna called</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>her voice sharp with urgency.</span><span> </span><span>"Diana... Dylan's been arrested for stealing trade secrets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t surprised at all. She just stared blankly out the window</span><span>, her mind frozen in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt a little sad, and a little lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching everyone who hurt her in her past life get what they deserved</span><span>&mdash;it didn</span><span>'</span><span>t bring her satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a sigh.</span><span> </span><span>This was Dylan</span><span>'s path</span><span>. Nothing would change just because Queenie </span><span>had </span><span>remembered their past lives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana never expected Dylan to turn himself in after escaping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She </span><span>pushed the thoughts of Paula and her family aside.</span><span> The process didn</span><span>'</span><span>t matter; the outcome was exactly what Diana wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t see Steven and felt a bit puzzled. </span><span>She furrowed her brow. The details were blurry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did he leave in the middle of the night?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1096.html">« Prev</a><a href="1098.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
