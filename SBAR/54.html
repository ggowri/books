I will go and explain to your mother that you were not lying about what happened last night.]</p><p>His message implied an insistence that couldn&#x27;t be refused.</p><p>Diana was outraged by his shamelessness.</p><p>Diana quickly replied to him, saying, [Steven, you are truly shameless. Piss off, scumbag!]</p><p>After sending the message, Diana blocked Steven.</p><p>Meanwhile, Steven was waiting for Diana to reconcile, but instead, he received insults from her.</p><p>His expression turned incredibly dark, and he immediately called Diana. However, after dialing several times, all he got was a continuous ringing tone or the call going unanswered.</p><p>Steven&#x27;s grip on the phone tightened slightly as he realized that Diana had blocked him again.</p><p>He stared at the conversation thread between him and Diana.</p><p>Their chat conversation still remained on the messages exchanged prior to their signing of the divorce agreement.</p><p>Diana: [Steven, your stomach isn&#x27;t well, remember not to eat anything spicy. I cooked your favorite steak for you tonight, remember to come back and eat it.]</p><p>Diana: [Steven, it&#x27;s very hot today. Remember not to stay under the air conditioning. You can&#x27;t handle the cold air, and it gives you headaches.]</p><p>As he continued scrolling up, he saw numerous messages from Diana expressing her concern for him. However, he had always ignored her presence.</p><p>She was quite clingy, and he always found it annoying, feeling as though he was being disregarded.</p><p>Now that she was gone, he felt a sense of calmness, but there was also a feeling of something missing.</p><p>He loved steak, and Diana would often cook it for him because she knew he liked it, and she was good at making it too.</p><p>It was only then that Steven realized Diana had been gone for nearly five months, and during this time, he couldn&#x27;t get used to the food prepared by the chefs.</p><p>He often reminisced about the home-cooked meals Diana used to make for him, all of which were his favorite dishes.</p><p>Steven stared at the phone number that had been blocked by Diana, his face darkened with a somber expression.</p><p>The thought of Diana saying that she would never love him again made him increasingly restless and agitated.</p><p>He looked at Evan, who was driving, and asked, &quot;Evan, it has been several days already. Have you found out where Diana is staying?&quot;</p><p>Evan shook his head and said, &quot;Mr. Gellar, I can&#x27;t find out where Ms. Bishop lives.&quot;</p><p>Steven frowned. How could they not find her? Capitole was vast, but there couldn&#x27;t be many Diana Bishops.</p><p>&quot;Why are you calling her Ms. Bishop? Why not Mrs. Gellar?&quot;</p><p>Evan was bewildered, thinking, &quot;Because you told me not to call her Mrs. Gellar.&quot;</p><p>He replied, &quot;Mr. Gellar, you&#x27;ve never allowed us to call her Mrs. Gellar. We sometimes call her Mrs. Gellar behind your back. The other day, I saw Mrs. Gellar&#x27;s WhatsApp Status. She said that loving someone to the point of losing oneself is the most foolish thing.&quot;</p><p>He continued, &quot;Today, I saw another status from Mrs. Gellar. She said she&#x27;s fallen in love with herself, and that loving herself is happier than loving someone else.&quot;</p><p>Steven&#x27;s grip on his phone tightened. He realized he had never checked Diana&#x27;s WhatsApp Status.</p><p>Had Diana blocked him?!</p><p>Steven&#x27;s anger flared up again.</p><p>&quot;Are you two friends?&quot; Steven&#x27;s voice grew increasingly cold and deep.</p><p>Evan felt a chill run down his spine. He mustered the courage to nod, &quot;Yes. Ms. Bishop sometimes inquiries about your return time so she can prepare your late-night snack or dinner, but she never bothers me. She just asks about your schedule.&quot;</p><p>In his eyes, Diana was truly a good woman and a good wife.</p><p>Except for being cautious around Steven, she was usually full of energy and life, glowing with confidence, fresh and beautiful.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Gellar, to be frank, Ms. Bishop is really considerate towards you. I don&#x27;t mean to say anything bad about Ms. Marsh, but she has never done anything for you. It seems like she&#x27;s never cooked for you. You guys always eat out.</p><p>&quot;Ms. Bishop takes care of your daily needs all year round. But all Ms. Marsh wants is for you to take her to fancy restaurants and show off online. That&#x27;s the difference...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enough. Stop right there. I don&#x27;t want to hear this,&quot; Steven growled in irritation.</p><p>It was only after Diana left that he noticed the things she had done were amplifying in his mind.</p><p>&quot;Diana is malicious. She can&#x27;t compare to Queenie.&quot;</p><p>Evan was speechless.</p><p>He thought, &quot;Do you really think you&#x27;re charming? In Ms. Bishop&#x27;s eyes, you&#x27;re cheap and common. Queenie is kind and gentle? Steven, are you blind?&quot;</p><p>Diana wanted to announce to the world, &quot;Steven, stay away from me. You&#x27;re a jerk!&quot;</p><p>Evan couldn&#x27;t hold back. &quot;Mr. Gellar, since you think Ms. Marsh is so great, I think you should stop pretending to look for Ms. Bishop. Haven&#x27;t you heard the saying? After the divorce, your world has nothing to do with me, and all you&#x27;re qualified to do is watch my world from the sidelines.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Gellar, you&#x27;ve been pushing Ms. Bishop to divorce you. The one who can&#x27;t let go after the separation is you. It&#x27;s so unfair.&quot;</p><p>Diana had helped him a lot, so naturally, he sided with Diana.</p><p>With his handsome neck and a foolish head that was too late to develop, Steven was clueless.</p><p>Evan was helpless. He knew that no matter what he said, Steven wouldn&#x27;t listen.</p><p>The beauty of love lay in its uncertainty. If the outcome could be predicted from the start, love would lose its charm.</p><p>The relationship between Queenie and Steven was just as subtle.</p><p>Queenie always clung to Steven.</p><p>Steven was unsure of his heart, so he could still be entangled with another woman even after marriage.</p><p>One day, Steven would become the representative of a jerk. He might even win an outstanding contribution award.</p><p>Steven looked at Evan, his eyes cold.</p><p>He roared in annoyance, &quot;Evan, just drive the car. Stop talking nonsense.&quot;</p><p>Evan fell silent.</p><p>Steven thought of Diana crying heart-wrenchingly on the stairs and remembered her words.</p><p>She had spent a hundred million dollars finding medicinal materials for him.</p><p>He recalled it with a sinking heart. He was blind at that time, but why did Diana lie to him?</p><p>Steven grabbed his phone and called his grandmother, Helen Gellar.</p><p>&quot;Hello, Grandma! It&#x27;s me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! It&#x27;s you. I thought it was some unfaithful man. What do you want from an old woman like me?&quot;</p><p>Helen was very dissatisfied with his divorce from Diana.</p><p>She was fond of Diana.</p><p>&quot;Grandma, I want to ask you, did you really find a doctor to treat me back then?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="53.html">« Prev</a><a href="55.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
