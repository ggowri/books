I know you like... flirting with guys..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, how can you say </span><span>that</span><span>? It is definitely my child. We've been together much earlier," Gale angrily interrupted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could my mum abuse my girlfriend like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope leaned into Gale's arms, grieved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mrs. Marsh, we love each other very much. How can you doubt my sincerity?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula frowned in silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie seized the opportunity to speak. "Mom, Penelope does like visiting nightclubs. </span><span>But a</span><span>ll of the young people nowadays do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale and Penelope have been together for many years. You can't treat her like this, especially when she's carrying Gale's child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula lowered her gaze, her eyes cold. As stubborn as always, Gale had never </span><span>listened to</span><span> her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Then</span><span> when do you plan to get married?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since I couldn't persuade him, why bother to continue?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he needs to get into trouble to grow up, then let it be."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Paula had compromised, Gale said excitedly,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, the competition is coming up soon. We'll hold the wedding right after that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then turned to Penelope in his arms, his tone thrilled,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Penelope, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Whatever you said</span><span>." She smiled gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, after the competition, I'll go propose to Penelope before her parents."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been dreaming of marrying this girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula looked up at his son's sincere expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My son insists on marrying Penelope, even though he knows I dislike her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula stood up tiredly. "I'm going to bed. You can continue."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Paula had agreed, Penelope exchanged a glance with Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie raised her eyebrows. She knew Paula would give in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, if it wasn't for Diana and Althea who plotted against you six months ago, causing you and Penelope to fall out, you might have been married already."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie took the chance to sow discord.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's eyes turned cold. "Humph! I will settle that score with her sooner or later. They always bad-mouth Penelope in front of me, but I know how kind my girlfriend is."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't let them off the hook for what they did."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, want some fruit?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope was indeed pregnant. She nodded. "I'd like some oranges."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No problem. Wait for a second. I'll go get them." Gale couldn't be happier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Gale go to the kitchen, Queenie muttered under her breath, "What an idiot!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope also </span><span>gave</span><span> a malicious smile. "The more foolish he is, the easier to manipulate him. Don't you think so?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hehe..." Queenie laughed eerily. That's true.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale quickly returned with oranges and peeled them for Penelope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not until Jeff returned did Penelope leave with a warm greeting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside, not far away, Diana's car was parked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She saw Gale drive Penelope back home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That woman must have come over to tell Gale she is pregnant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Poor boy! He's no idea that he has already been cuckolded."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't help but feel raged remembering the events from six months ago. It was Penelope who had plotted against Gale, yet she herself had been framed for it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea was the one who suffered the most that night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet no one believed them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They only trusted Queenie and Penelope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deeply loved by Gale, Penelope kept speaking ill of Althea all the time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea was now pregnant. According to what Diana knew from her previous life, the baby was almost six months along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took out her phone to call Althea.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't contacted her earlier due to training.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now she wasn't sure if she could reach her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana dialed the number.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="95.html">« Prev</a><a href="97.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
