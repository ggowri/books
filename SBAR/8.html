Something had stabbed her foot, freaking her out and making her leg cramp up. She was in deep water and nearly went under.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She watched Diana going down and got worried. "Hey, you okay? Come on up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana tried to chill out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fighting through the pain in her feet, she slowly made it to the surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rita spotted blood in the water, then saw it on herself. Her eyes went wide, realizing someone had messed with the pool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Miss." Rita wanted to help Diana, but she couldn't move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana felt something was wrong. She tried to climb up but finally fell powerlessly beside Rita. She felt dizzy, and it seemed that the stuff in the water was anesthetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Madam, there's something in the water. It seems to make people lose their strength."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was soaked, and her feet were bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The wound on the soles of her feet felt horrible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rita saw that Diana's wounds were more severe than the ones on her feet, and she also felt that her whole body was gradually losing strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's okay. My bodyguard will be here soon. Thank you for saving me. If it weren't for you, I would have been dead today." Rita&rsquo;s voice was weak. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana wanted to speak but gradually lost consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Madam, are you okay?" Rita's bodyguard came running over in panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pointed at Diana and said, "Come on. Send her to the hospital. She is seriously injured."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bodyguard was worried. "Madam, I'll take you there first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Cut the crap. She saved me. Send her to the hospital now." Rita's tone left no room for doubt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bodyguard did not dare to delay and carried Diana to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Watched them walk away, Rita fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Queenie, who had arrived, did not see the previous scene and quickly ran to Rita.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at the sleeping old lady, she quickly jumped into the water. After she was soaked, she came ashore near Rita, and shouted around, "Help! Help! Someone got drowned!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Rita's grandson came to pick up his grandma. Hearing the cry for help, he quickened his pace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grandma! Grandma!" Cecil Farley was prettier than most women, but not in a weird way. Tall and slim, with a laid-back vibe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's eyes widened as she looked at the handsome man. Compared with a cold man like Steven, such a man seemed more ideal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sir, it's better to take her to the hospital." She said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil glanced at Queenie and said gratefully, "Thank you for saving my grandma. This is my business card. Please contact me tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie took the business card and looked at Rita, pretending to be worried. "Sir, I just want to help. You should take her to the hospital now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you. Miss, remember to contact me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil looked at the blood all over the ground, his eyes deepening slightly. Someone had tampered with the pool and wanted to kill his grandma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He carried Rita and left, with the bodyguards leading the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at the business card and showed a strange and triumphant smile. She had just accompanied Steven to the banquet and wasted some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the result was what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, just wait. I will trample you under my feet!" she thought, feeling smug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't wake up until the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias sat beside her. His handsome face eased as he noticed she was awake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias couldn't help scolding, "Silly girl, if you don't wake up, your name will be engraved on the monument!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana asked in surprise, "Tobias, you mean I almost died?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="7.html">« Prev</a><a href="9.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
