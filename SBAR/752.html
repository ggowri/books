She brushed her fingers across Owen's chest and smiled wantonly and charmingly, "Owen, we've slept together. You know what I like."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't make it clear, but Owen understood what she meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen sneered. At that moment, he suddenly found her disgusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't touch me. You make me sick." He couldn't accept that he had to share the same woman with his good friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a playboy, but he only had sex to satisfy his desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette didn't care. Men all wanted to save face, but when they were in bed, they only cared about having fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still smiling charmingly, her beautiful eyes slightly narrowed, and her perfect makeup was alluring. "Owen, I still remember you screamed in comfort that night. Have you forgotten it so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's eyes were red with undisguised disdain in them, and a sneer appeared on his full red lips. "Yvette, you returned home to gain a foothold in your family. Don't be like a man who indulges in dissipation. You slept with me to get me to set you up with Steven. He's different from me. I have sex just to release stress, but he keeps all the stress inside him. If you try to trick him into sleeping with you, you might get yourself ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Yvette thought of how cold Steven was, her charming smile instantly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew everyone in their circle was a player.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Steven was the same as Owen, who would have a different woman every night.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she had to change tack to force Queenie away from Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a calculating look in her eyes as she said, "Owen, thank you for what you did today. I'll take care of the rest myself. I gotta go."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her head slightly, her voice tender and charming. "Don't forget to call me when you feel lonely at night."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had a cold expression and said nothing, standing where he was motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette said no more and walked away gracefully with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh..." Owen kicked the wall hard. "What's all this about? She really disgraced me. Looks like she fancies Steven. She has slept with me but likes my good friend. This is really disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen left furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, on the other hand, had been following Diana, and he was relieved only after seeing her and Alexander separate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana drove back, and Steven asked Evan to follow her car until they got outside the villa. Only after he was sure that she had really gone home did he go to the office with peace of mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan looked at Steven in the rearview mirror. His cold expression and eyes were intimidating. "Is he jealous?" Evan wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Evan didn't dare to ask. He shifted the topic to work and asked, "Mr. Gellar, what about the King family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give up the cooperation. That woman has bad intentions," Steven replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled and said, "Mr. Gellar, she has bad intentions towards you. Don't bring your personal feelings to work."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Steven was annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan did as he was told.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed his eyes and thought of Diana's long hair entangled in the button of Alexander's coat. They looked intimate, and he was so angry that he wanted to kick Alexander's ass.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath. In his twenty-plus years of life, this was the first time he'd felt such a strong possessiveness towards a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not feel the slightest bit irritated, but instead, he was filled with a deep sense of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, unlocked his phone to check the stock market, and saw that the stocks he followed Diana to buy had skyrocketed. His expression softened a little finally.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="751.html">« Prev</a><a href="753.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
