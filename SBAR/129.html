When they saw a store with nice styles, they went in to choose clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled and said, "Olivia, you like to wear robes, I will help you design one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia rolled her eyes at her. "In this bustling metropolis, you want me to wear a robe?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew that Olivia looked beautiful in anything she wore. "But you might as well wear a robe instead of buying these clothes. A robe will make you look more elegant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia was speechless. She didn't have to wear robes. Although she inherited a religion, she dared to go down the mountain only after she had earned enough money in the past few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Please design a few haute couture dresses for me." Olivia liked the haute couture dresses designed by Diana, they were really beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, I'll help you design it tomorrow. In a week, you'll be able to wear a luxurious haute couture dress. I'll design and make it myself. It's one-of-a-kind." Olivia was very happy. The clothes designed by Diana were comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana helped her pick out clothes. She saw a light grey suit with a nice design and handed it to Olivia, saying, "Olivia, this suits you very well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia liked it when she saw it. She looked at the salesperson and said, "Please find me a size medium."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The salesperson smiled and nodded, saying, "Okay, please wait a moment!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the salesperson brought a size suitable for Olivia, and Olivia asked her to pack it up. She was not very picky about clothes, as long as it was comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew her character and continued to pick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey! Isn't this the abandoned slut Diana? How come she has the money to shop here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A mocking voice was heard, and a cold light flashed across Diana's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Queenie and Penelope who walked in, and her good mood instantly disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered and said, "Ah, It turned out to be Queenie's number one follower."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This idiot would probably never know until her death that Queenie had been using her to confuse Gale. Once Gale died, she would become a discarded pawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope's face suddenly turned pale. She was on good terms with Queenie because she had Steven behind her, and her family also wanted to do business well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie sneered and said, "Diana, Penelope is right. You are abandoned by Steven. What are you proud of? Did you come here to buy things in the hope of meeting Steven? It's a pity that he won't come out to the mall at night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie proudly took out a black card and showed it off, "Diana, did you see it? This is the black card Steven gave me. He gives me hundreds of millions of dollars every year, but you can't even spend a dime of his money. Even if you are his wife, you have to pay for the groceries yourself. This is the difference between being loved and not being loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And the money he gave me is more than you will ever get in your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Olivia met them, she would become somewhat impulsive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was about to go over and teach Queenie a lesson but was stopped by Diana.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="128.html">« Prev</a><a href="130.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
