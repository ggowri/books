"Mr. Gellar, everyone in Capitole knows you're engaged to Queenie. You take Ms. Marsh to every event, and the two of you make a perfect couple. Congratulations in advance, and send me an invitation when you get married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and changed the subject. "By the way, Mr. Farley, what deal were you discussing earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering the matter at hand, Wyatt's expression turned serious. "Mr. Gellar, could you do me a favor? I'll give you the land in Westwood if you can convince Diana to spare my son. The Westwood property will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gazed at him thoughtfully, his eyes darkening. The Westwood land?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was willing to go to great lengths for his son, even offering the valuable Westwood land in exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought it might be worth considering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll try to talk to her," Steven replied indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt gave a meaningful smile, knowing that the Westwood land was something Steven had always wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men are willing to sacrifice women for profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't aware of everything; his son had assaulted a police officer</span><span> just now</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Steven got into the car, Evan asked, "Mr. Gellar, are you going to make Ms. Bishop forgive Samuel just to get Westwood land?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave Evan a cold look. Evan seemed overly concerned about Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know how important the Westwood land is to the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan fell silent, realizing that, to Steven, nothing was more important than the company's growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then asked, "Mr. Gellar, are we heading to the office?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked out the window, his gaze unreadable. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's phone vibrated; it was Queenie calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed his lips together, a flash of cold anger in his eyes, and answered the call with composed grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello!" he said, his voice low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his tone, Queenie felt a slight chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been filming on the island for a few days, and Steven hadn't called her even once, making her uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I'm back today. Can we have lunch together?" Queenie asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced out the window and agreed. "Sure. Once you've booked the restaurant, text me. I have a meeting at the office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven ended the call after that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan glanced at Steven through the rearview mirror and sighed inwardly. So it was true that one's first love was the hardest to forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At noon, Diana arrived at the office, where Luna was waiting for her at the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, your injury hasn't healed yet. Why did you come to the office?" Luna asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head and smiled. "I'm fine. I have some matters to attend to. Paige brought ten models back to the company, and I came to check on them and give them a few days off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna noticed Diana's immobile arm, still badly injured, and that she had driven herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna said, "Diana, Queenie came back today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about Samuel's situation. Queenie must be getting desperate. Diana was fine, but Samuel was facing jail time, so how could Queenie not be anxious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having lost the gamble, she was beginning to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had believed Samuel could kill her, but even he hadn't expected her to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered. "They'll be in touch with Wyatt and Courtney soon. Keep an eye on them."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="497.html">« Prev</a><a href="499.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
