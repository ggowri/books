My only goal now is to divorce you. I've brought the divorce agreement with me. I don't want a single thing from the Foliot family, all I want is to take what's rightfully mine. As for the kids, I don't want custody of them either, since they clearly don't want me as their mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gestured to her lawyer, who stepped forward and handed Mark the divorce agreement her father had helped arrange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled at Mark and said, "Mr. Foliot, let's do this divorce in front of everyone here, and in front of all the viewers in the livestream. I'm letting you and Amelie be together. You've been involved with her for over twenty years now; it's time I stop standing in your way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he truly wanted to be with Amelie, he could've simply divorced her. The only reason he'd tried to kill her was to secure her entire fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such unforgivable greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead and sign the agreement. Once it's done, there will be nothing left between us, and you and Amelie can live your lives together. I won't stand in the way of your son and daughter calling her 'mom.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What wasn't hers, she wouldn't force. Her children didn't love her, but she had a clear conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark froze, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Lily's resolute expression, he knew she was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Why isn't she exposing me? This isn't like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's she up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She comes back, not to accuse me, but to ask for a divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you and Mom never had any real love between you. Isn't a divorce for the best?" Jean suddenly appeared behind Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had already overheard Jean calling Amelie "Mom" the previous day, and her heart had gone cold. Hearing Jean's words now didn't stir her in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking smile tugged at Lily's lips. "Mark, did you hear that? Even your daughter wants us to divorce. This agreement is fair to both of us. I have principles. I won't take more than my due.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But everything that's rightfully mine, I'll take back entirely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark looked at her, noting her calm and steady smile, and suddenly, he didn't want a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He convinced himself that Lily loved him too much to leave him so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling, he said, "Lily, don't be like this. Now that you're back, let's make things work. As for the woman outside... I'll cut things off with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean, however, disagreed. She wanted Amelie in her life. "Dad, you stopped loving Mom long ago. Forcing this marriage only makes everyone miserable. Divorce her. She's disabled now, do you really want to be stuck taking care of a cripple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily just smiled at Jean's words, saying nothing. She thought bitterly, "So, in Jean's mind, I'm just a cripple. My own daughter doesn't even want to take care of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's fine. Let her say what she wants. I don't care anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark, sign the papers. I won't interfere with your 'happy family of four' any longer. I'm giving you what you want. What more could you ask for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark looked into her calm, unshaken gaze, sensing there was more to this than met the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head and studied the agreement carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Lily wasn't greedy. She wanted all that was hers but wouldn't take a single cent more. Yet, if her family were to withdraw their investment, his company would collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, I... I don't want a divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Dad... what about Amelie? You promised her you'd marry her!" Jean yelled loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark hesitated, unable to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Unbelievable, what kind of daughter is this? A total ingrate! Recognizing the mistress as her 'mom' and calling her real mother a cripple? What a monster!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[If you ask me, Lily must've been too harsh on her kids; otherwise, why would they embrace the mistress as their mom?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comment section was in an uproar once again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="821.html">« Prev</a><a href="823.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
