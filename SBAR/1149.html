Even though it's three years late, we can be happy for a lifetime. Queenie, I've always been getting what I wished for."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, your life is full of regrets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was shocked, wondering why Diana always understood things faster than she did. By the time she realized, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Diana, after Steven hurt you like that, do you not mind? Every time you're with him, don't you think about how he used to be with me and treated me well?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you not mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nervously looked at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and explained, "Queenie, my love is different from yours. Someone I truly loved could never just be a friend. The moment we meet, I&rsquo;d soften. Just one more glance at him in a crowd, and I&rsquo;d want him back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, I don't mind the past. What he did back then was just to deceive you. His kindness to me is genuine. So, when the misunderstanding was cleared up, every time I see him, my heart still skips a beat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stepped back in disbelief. She had used up all her luck but still didn&rsquo;t find true love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana, despite being hurt so badly, had someone who truly loved her in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie felt like she had been living in a dream her whole life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her dream shattered, and she ended up with nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could only break down while trying to heal herself, beyond saving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's obsession with money and status, mixed with resentment and unwillingness, made her stubbornly believe she could take everything away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, it seems she got nothing, yet feels an unbearable heartache.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Steven, recalling his gentle demeanor back then, and couldn't help but say, "Steven, if only we could go back to when we first met. Actually, I liked you at that moment too. But later, I met George, who, like me, lived in the shadows. He was more cheerful than you. He was like a ray of light in my life. I fell in love with him at that time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But later, I realized that many small things were done by you for me. I fell in love with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven with tenderness and affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lowered his head, looked at Diana, and gently said, "Darling, let's go inside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stellar Love was what he wanted to give her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, who received no response, was about to cry but remained calm and entered the auction hall with Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario was displeased because Queenie still had feelings for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He craved her love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, haven't I been good enough to you? Are you still thinking about that heartless Steven?" Mario said jealously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled, "Mario, you misunderstood. I love you now. I just want to see if Steven still has any genuine feelings for me. If he does, I can use him one more time. Rather than making him my husband, I'd rather have all his assets belong to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario smiled, "As expected, all you care about is money. Queenie, you're already very wealthy now..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But it's still not enough," Queenie gently interrupted him, "Mario, trust me. I'll make you the husband of the richest woman."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario liked this title. It was his dream too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled, wrapping his arm around Queenie's waist. They walked together, looking quite a match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone at the auction today came for the diamonds. Tonight's diamond jewelry is crafted by top designers. The auction is crowded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Mario entered and sat next to Steven and Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next to Diana were Cecil and Olivia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the two of them, Diana was very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Olivia, Cecil, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt quite surprised, wondering when their relationship had become so good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia waved at Diana and said, "Diana, you're here too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Yeah. I heard the diamonds at tonight's auction are beautiful, so I came to take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil leaned against Steven and said, "Mr. Gellar, whatever I fancy tonight, you better not compete with me. When it comes to wealth, I&rsquo;m not losing to you. Let&rsquo;s not ruin our harmony over some gemstones."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven calmly said, "Bid on whatever you like."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn't care about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil looked at Olivia and asked, "Olivia, what color diamonds do you like?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia looked sweet and charming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly looked at him in confusion and said, "I like light pink diamonds. Why are you asking me this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil directly said, "Because I want to buy it for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Olivia was about to ask why, the auction host had already picked up the microphone to introduce today's auction items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, today's auction begins. Our first item is a legendary gemstone, the purple diamond, also known as Stellar Love. Starting bid: ten million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie also came for Stellar Love. She thought it was a sapphire, but it turned out to be a light pale purple, very beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "15 million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "20 million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie suddenly looked at Steven, guessing he intended to bid for Stellar Love to give it to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The diamonds at this auction are all top-notch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although many came for Stellar Love, not everyone could afford its price.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also loved the diamond's faint purple hue; it was beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought, "I can't compete with Steven's wealth, but I'll make him suffer a loss."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled, raised her paddle again, and said, "50 million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "100 million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "200 million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was certain Steven would keep raising the bid, so she competed with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and Diana are in a great relationship now. Whatever Diana likes, no matter the cost, Steven will find a way to buy it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "250 million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "300 million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "400 million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire auction hall fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven and said, "Are you crazy? It's just a stone. Is it worth spending so much money?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1148.html">« Prev</a><a href="1150.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
