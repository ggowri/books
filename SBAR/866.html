Luna's frantic voice pierced through the air as she threw open her car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second's hesitation, she plunged into the freezing water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." The biting cold jolted Evan back to consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes snapped open, his pupils quivering with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happens? Where is me?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So cold..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his thought, saltwater rushed into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The briny, pungent taste made him gag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chill cut through him like a blade. His mind reeled as he tried to piece together why he was in the ocean. "Is this a nightmare?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan! Evan! Hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's trembling voice reached him, though the icy water made her words falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind roared, yet her call found its way to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna..." He shivered so hard that even his voice quaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay with me, Evan. I'm coming for you," she shouted, her heart sinking as she watched the waves drag him farther away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Evan truly saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was there, fighting the waves, swimming toward him with everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna... Luna..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another wave crashed over him, forcing water into his mouth and dragging him under.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan! Don't give up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's cry was filled with desperation as she pushed herself harder, her strokes slicing through the frigid water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's limbs felt numb, the icy grip of the sea robbing him of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he truly grasped the terrifying power of nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was out of energy, and his vision blurred. Watching Luna fight her way toward him, he wanted to shout, "Luna, don't come! Go back! It's too dangerous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his frozen throat couldn't form the words. His teeth chattered as he tried to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna... don't..." His voice was barely a whisper, his breath visible in the frosty air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Evan sink deeper, Luna felt her heart drop like a stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes burned with tears as she pushed herself even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The water was freezing, but she still gave her all to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold was relentless, slashing at her like a thousand knives, but she didn't falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had one wish that they would both make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she reached Evan. In the chaos of the waves, her hand grasped his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief surged through her as she clung to him with all her might and began to swim back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shore wasn't far, and a wave mercifully swept them closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Nolan's bodyguards arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the next wave crashed, two men waded into the surf to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna shook her head as she looked at them. "Zane, I'm fine. Get him into the car. It's freezing out here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane Newman and the other guard lifted Evan, helping them both to the safety of the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, I have spare clothes in the car. I'll help this gentleman change first, and you can change in your car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!" Luna was shivering uncontrollably. She cast a worried glance at Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry, get him changed," she urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards nodded, carrying Evan to their car while Luna returned to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cranked the heat to its maximum, the warm air slowly thawing her icy skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, she stripped off her soaked clothes as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In winter, she always kept spare clothes in the car, just in case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once changed, she grabbed a towel to dry her hair, which had already begun to freeze in the bitter cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the heater worked quickly, restoring warmth to her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a sip of hot water from her thermos, the heat spreading from her stomach to her limbs, easing her shivers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling out her phone, she sent a message to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana, we're okay now. Evan is safe, too.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, already at the hospital, replied promptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Good! It's freezing out there. Come to the hospital for a full check-up. I'll be waiting.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Alright. Evan fainted again. I'll bring him in for treatment.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna drove over. Evan had already changed his clothes but had fainted again, lying limply in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna felt sorry for him. Evan was usually so cheerful and diligent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She radioed Zane, instructing him to follow her to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Steven called her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, how's Evan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had contacted Steven again, and he had learned that Evan had been thrown into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panicked, he immediately called Luna, knowing she had stayed close to Evan. At that time, Luna was his only hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna replied, "Mr. Gellar, Evan's alive, but I'm taking him to the hospital. He was tossed into the ocean and passed out again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Thank you, Luna. Send me the hospital's address. I'll be there soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After texting him the location, Luna hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She brought Evan to Diana's hospital, where Diana and Paige were waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, they arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Luna and Evan were suffering from the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna had felt feverish and groggy during the drive, realizing she'd caught a chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met them at the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She directed Zane to take Evan to a ward and insisted Luna get treated as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them had frostbitten skin, so Diana applied ointment before starting their IV drips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While receiving her treatment, Luna recounted the day's events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned. "So, who were those men who kidnapped Evan? And why did they want to kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I think it was Queenie. If Mr. Gellar keeps covering for her crimes, she'll never face justice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave a wry smile. No evidence yet pointed to Queenie. "He's already handed her the designs. Covering for her involvement in a murder wouldn't be surprising. But let's wait for the investigation to confirm it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna seethed. "Diana, it has to be her. She's the only one who would hurt Paige and Evan like this. If Mr. Gellar doesn't care about Evan's life, why does he even work for someone like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I risked my life to pull Evan out of the sea. If Steven doesn't value him, let Evan work for you instead. He's a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven overheard this as he entered the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His deep gaze darkened as he quickly stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Luna noticed his presence and stopped talking, but neither acknowledged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes softened with relief as he saw Evan safe and receiving treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Luna, he said sincerely, "Thank you for saving Evan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's face remained dark. "Don't thank me. Just catch the people who kidnapped him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at Diana, noticing her weariness. He had seen the news earlier that she had saved a mother and child today.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="865.html">« Prev</a><a href="867.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
