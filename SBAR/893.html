His mom had already sent his brothers abroad secretly, and now, they were distant memories.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mom, if I leave now, what about Gale? He&#x27;s got surgery this afternoon. He needs someone with him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula patted his hand with a smile, trying to reassure him. &quot;Eric, of the four of you, you&#x27;re the most level-headed. Gale is too stubborn, Frank is too gullible, and Noah is far too impulsive. You&#x27;re the only one suited for business. Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll take care of your brother, and I&#x27;ll have Lena accompany you to handle things.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Our family&#x27;s century-old legacy will rise again, stronger than ever.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Over the years, I&#x27;ve always kept a way out in business. As long as the four of you are willing to adapt, our family will find its footing again.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula&#x27;s smile was gentle. The sudden life changes had worn down her pride and stubbornness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eric felt a deep sense of guilt. Their stubbornness had caused the family&#x27;s downfall, forcing him to grow up quickly. He understood so much more now, but it was too late to change some things.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Mom. We were so immature before.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula smiled, though her heart felt heavy. &quot;It&#x27;s not too late to understand now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula turned to look at the two people fighting fiercely and walked over with a smile. &quot;Oh my! Tracey, wasn&#x27;t Amelie your precious daughter-in-law? Weren&#x27;t you so fond of her? How could you bear to hit her now?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">At the sound of Paula&#x27;s voice, everyone turned to look at her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula didn&#x27;t look anything like the defeated woman they had imagined. She still carried herself with grace and poise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tracey suddenly pulled Amelie aside, regret filling her eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She regretted it deeply now. Back when Paula was her daughter-in-law, she used to get a monthly allowance of 10 thousand dollars. Now, she had nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A profound resentment shone in her cloudy eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tracey shouted harshly, &quot;Paula, this wretched woman isn&#x27;t even human! She deserved to be hit!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Paula, what are you doing here?&quot; Amelie looked disheveled and humiliated, and the last thing she wanted was to see Paula now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had spent her entire life comparing herself to Paula, yet she was the one who had ended up in the most miserable state.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula smiled gracefully. &quot;I&#x27;m here to tell you that all the money you used to raise your sonâ€”it was my money, and I want it back. I&#x27;ve already recorded everything just now, so you&#x27;ll return every cent you took.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie was speechless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Paula, you&#x27;re dreaming. That money wasn&#x27;t yours! It was earned by Jeff&#x27;s company. What right do you have to ask for it back?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Whether or not I have the right, that&#x27;s for me to decide. You, of all people, know how Jeff&#x27;s company came to be, don&#x27;t you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie was stunned!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula&#x27;s lips curved into a gentle smile, full of elegance. &quot;Jeff, so this was why you forced me to divorce you? To raise someone else&#x27;s son?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The mocking look in her eyes pierced Jeff&#x27;s heart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Paula, there&#x27;s no need to mock me like this. I don&#x27;t regret my choices,&quot; Jeff said stubbornly, knowing full well there was no going back for them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had been foolish, unable to see through Amelie&#x27;s facade. If he could do it all over again, he would never make the same choice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula&#x27;s smile remained calm. &quot;It&#x27;s good you don&#x27;t regret it. Fortunately, you made me sign that disownment agreement back then. But it&#x27;s fine. You may have lost a son, but you still have a daughter.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula&#x27;s gaze shifted pointedly to Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff felt a crushing pain in his chest, overwhelmed with regret. He couldn&#x27;t catch his breath for a moment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie glared at Paula, her low laugh filled with bitterness. &quot;Paula, you brought Tracey here, didn&#x27;t you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula openly admitted it, her smile as radiant as the morning light, brimming with a sense of renewal.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Such a good show deserves an audience. Tracey has always been so proud of her grandson, but he&#x27;s not even her real grandson. She had to know, didn&#x27;t she? Was it wrong to invite her?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula&#x27;s casual tone made Amelie feel like killing her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Paula, I&#x27;ll kill you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie charged at Paula, wild with rage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff quickly stepped in front of Paula, blocking Amelie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie let out a furious laugh, her face twisted in anger. &quot;Jeff, you&#x27;re stopping me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff lowered his eyes and gave a cold smile. &quot;Amelie, let&#x27;s just live like this, tormenting each other for the rest of our lives.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie froze for a moment. &quot;No! I want a divorce.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Impossible. I&#x27;ll never divorce you,&quot; Jeff said with a malicious smile that sent a chill through Amelie&#x27;s heart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That smile was all too familiar, and it filled Amelie with dread. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he could drug Paula, who had been good to him her entire life, what wouldn&#x27;t he do to her after she had cheated on him?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jeff, you ruined my youth. Are you planning to destroy the rest of my life too?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie screamed angrily. Her son had returned, and she was determined to secure a better future for him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had deceived Jeff for years.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If this truth hadn&#x27;t been exposed, she could have endured it for her son&#x27;s sake.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But with things blown up like this, why should she continue to endure it?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff watched her panic and smiled. &quot;Amelie, your youth was paid for by me. Everything you ate and used came from me. Did Mark give you as much as I did? Are you seriously telling me you two fools didn&#x27;t spend a dime of my money?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie was speechless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jeff, for Queenie&#x27;s sake, I won&#x27;t divorce you, but you&#x27;re never to bring this up again.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mom, if you don&#x27;t divorce him, are you planning to spend the rest of your life with a loser?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A cocky voice came from behind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff looked up and saw Noah.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;When did you get back?&quot; Jeff asked, looking at him in shock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Noah had put on a bit of weight and wore an oversized suit, but his features were still decent. Smiling, he walked over and stood in front of Queenie. &quot;Queenie, aren&#x27;t you happy to see me back home?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie gave a cold laugh. &quot;What&#x27;s there to welcome? You&#x27;re back; that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A wave of bitterness welled up in Queenie&#x27;s heart. Although he was her eldest brother, compared to her other four brothers, he had done nothing for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He only ever opened his mouth to ask for money. As for birthday or holiday gifts? He had never once bought her anything.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Gale and her other brothers were different. Whatever she wanted, they would buy for her without a second thought, no matter the price.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This was Paula&#x27;s first time meeting Noah. Looking at him, he didn&#x27;t resemble Mark. Whose son was he?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eric glanced at Jeff and mocked him. &quot;So, Mr. Marsh, this is the amazing son you&#x27;ve been raising abroad? I thought he&#x27;d be someone extraordinary, but now I see he&#x27;s just a nobody.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing Eric&#x27;s voice, Jeff became emotional. &quot;Eric, I don&#x27;t consider him my son. My only children are you and your siblings.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eric laughed mockingly. &quot;Don&#x27;t kid yourself. You already forced the five of us to sign a disownment agreement.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jeff&#x27;s pupils constricted sharply. At that moment, he realized the one who had lost everything was him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Supporting his mother, Eric said, &quot;Mom, let&#x27;s go. It&#x27;s almost time for the doctor&#x27;s appointment.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="892.html">Â« Prev</a><a href="894.html">Next Â»</a></div></div></body></html>
