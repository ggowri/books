He had been eager to finalize his divorce and marry Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since childhood, he had been used to Queenie staying with him and relying on him. Even when she was scared and crying because of cockroaches, she sought comfort from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was different. She didn't need his help for anything. She had always been strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when she was bullied, she endured it. And when Steven left her alone on a snowy day, she didn't make a fuss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But did a person who didn't complain really not feel pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana recounted his wrongdoings, Steven realized that she was also in pain. However, he had been preoccupied, and she didn't want to burden him with her own pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, on the other hand, would call him over even if he was busy when she was mistreated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sat there, drunk and despondent. Owen looked at him meaningfully. "Steven, are you the kind of guy who only cherishes something once it's gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven replied nonchalantly, "Maybe. After my accident, Queenie left. You mentioned that she intentionally left because I was disabled and she didn't want to take care of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I don't need her to look after me. Her reason was that my mother forced her away. Later, I realized that I was too naive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana took great care of me over those two years, but due to my depression, I didn't treat her very well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stopped, falling silent. After Diana left, he couldn't help but miss how good she had been to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every little thing he did reminded him of her, especially when he had a stomachache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, whenever he had a stomach issue, Diana would advise him not to drink, take better care of himself, and come home for dinner more often. Her home-cooked meals were simple but delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever he looked at Diana, he saw her as nothing more than a housewife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Coming from a privileged background, Steven had always been prideful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He used to think that Diana, who came from a poor family, was not as impressive as Queenie, who excelled at everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He overlooked many of Diana's strengths and believed that she couldn't survive without him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was wrong. It was he who couldn't live without her. He missed the care and comfort Diana had brought him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was skilled in medicine and design. After she left, everything she accomplished amazed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, her words tonight had panicked him. He realized that Diana was truly never coming back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven closed his eyes, weariness etched on his face and his brows furrowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen looked at his distressed friend and smiled. "Steven, don't be too sad. The damage has been done. Besides, you teamed up with the Marsh family to hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your biggest mistake was knowing that Queenie planned everything, but still choosing to hurt Diana. She took care of you for two years. She could have continued to love you, but she has emotions and can feel pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since she left you, there have been plenty of good-looking guys around her. It's been almost half a year now. Maybe she will meet the right person and fall in love with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes widened with realization. He thought of Alexander, a man who was on par with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Alexander had yet to establish a solid position within the Powell family. The thought of Diana falling in love with someone else deepened Steven's sorrow. He pressed his lips together and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen's heart ached for his friend. He knew Steven was lonely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's company was solely for the Gellar family's resources.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Jeff was incompetent and ruined his business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen looked at Steven and asked, "Let's me ask you. What do you see in Queenie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was stunned. What did he see in Queenie?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="363.html">« Prev</a><a href="365.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
