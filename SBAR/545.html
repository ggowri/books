"Steven, don't be upset, it's Diana who didn't know how to cherish you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shook off her hand and left silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven." Queenie followed him out angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the restaurant, it was snowing. Steven stood in the wind and snow, the cold wind stinging his face, making his mind clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly thought of Diana's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I'm not afraid of the cold. I said I was afraid of the cold because I wanted you to care about me more, but did you ever pay any attention to me?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She always expected his care in the past, but he never noticed that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, let's go back and continue our dinner." Queenie hooked her arm through his, not letting him leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to create buzz for herself and attract public attention, every time she was with Steven, she would have paparazzi take photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Steven as the draw, the movie was sure to be a big hit once it was released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said indifferently, "Eat by yourself, and eat more. After all, you still need to put in a lot of effort for your movie. Keep your scandals under wraps; don't let them be dug up before the movie is even released."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shocked and cried out. "Steven, what do you mean? Don't you even trust me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her with cold eyes, making Queenie feel very pressured. It was as if she saw the gloomy and cold young man from back then once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven spoke coldly, "Queenie, if you don't want anyone to know, then don't do it. Do you think everyone is blind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two stayed in the same room on the island and ate at the same restaurant. Don't you know that? Do you need me to help you count?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie widened her eyes, "Did you have someone spy on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered, his face looking somewhat distorted as he looked at her shocked expression. "I didn't even do this. Your actions, naturally, were reported to me. If you don't behave yourself, then don't blame others for framing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie suddenly widened her eyes. He refused to touch her, which was his loss, but he actually didn't even allow her to have fun with other handsome men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven left, and only when Queenie looked up did she realize that he had disappeared into the snowstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and laughed. She was actually seen through by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was still willing to have dinner with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had always been her most loyal simp. After all, during his toughest years, she was the one who stayed by his side, and Steven still had feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was right; Steven had infinite patience with Queenie. He didn't question what she did before because he just wanted to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she still came out on top over Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven would always be loyal to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath. After thinking it through, she felt much better. After Steven left, she called Mario over, and they had dinner together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Diana, after she returns to the country, Queenie is determined to take her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana drove to the island early the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand was injured, so she drove very slowly and didn't arrive at the island until noon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The island was colder than Capitole, being closer to the sea, with stronger winds and heavier snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She parked her car downstairs from Althea's house, opened her thermos, took some anti-inflammatory medicine, and then got out of the car to go upstairs.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="544.html">« Prev</a><a href="546.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
