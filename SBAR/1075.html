Look at my memory. Our sweet pea is still so naive. I've spoiled her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He secretly thought to himself that it was too late for him to reflect now; Diana had long been led astray by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana enthusiastically said, "Grandpa, I'll go take a look later. I've already turned the ten go-go dancers you found for me last time into top models. If these twenty models have good potential, I'll also give them more job opportunities."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold shook his head helplessly. "I originally got them to entertain you, but now you've turned them all into money-makers. Who's the one always saying they like handsome guys? When I actually put handsome guys in front of you, all you do is make them work for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt speechless. "Grandpa, you can't say that. Didn't you always teach me not to rely on others? These handsome guys can make money for me and support me. Isn't this the best of both worlds?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold was shocked. He narrowed his sly eyes and said, "Well, how did you come up with that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed and said, "Grandpa, what else do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "What girl wouldn't like a charming handsome guy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold replied angrily, "I just want a great-grandchild. I'm already old, can't I enjoy a new life?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the past half year, I've traveled to various countries and cities and grown tired of it all. You three are still unmarried, and your sister still has no children after marriage. Can't you give me something to look forward to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly realized that Leopold was urging her to have a child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was about to divorce Steven, and Leopold's wish was destined to go unfulfilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly looked at Diana. He wished so much to have a child with her, preferably a beautiful girl just like her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana changed the subject, pointing at Tobias and saying, "Tobias, you're almost thirty. Why don't you have a girlfriend yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias looked puzzled. "How can I get one?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Julius again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius smiled wryly and said, "I've been busy with work all year and never had time for dating."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them looked at each other and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold said angrily, "What are you laughing at? You all look good, but none of you are married. What's missing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them fell silent instantly. They didn't want to bring it up because matters of the heart can't be forced, and luck plays a big role.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana placed a lobster on Leopold's plate and said playfully, "Grandpa, don't be mad. Next year, I'll definitely give you a great-grandchild, and you'll be so busy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold looked even more displeased. "Steven is already in love with Queenie. Who are you going to have a child with? Are you planning to find a go-go dancer?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold gave Steven, who was sitting beside him, a meaningful look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven instantly felt uneasy, sensing that Leopold's gaze carried a deeper meaning, as if he already knew everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Maybe that could work too..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't finished speaking when Cecil suddenly interrupted her, "Diana, this is the fish you love."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stayed silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven really liked the atmosphere of the Bishop family, and she could feel the warmth of family when dining and living with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dinner, Diana had some cake, and the birthday party ended in the sweetness of the dessert. She had never received so many gifts before and was overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, she was going to a bar to watch go-go dancers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The city lights sparkled in the night, still shrouded in a thin mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie wandered aimlessly through the streets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana always amazed her before, but tonight was different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tonight, she truly witnessed what grandeur means.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, even when Paula loved her the most, she would only give her tens of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..." Queenie sneered as she looked up, only to see Paula and Eric across from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two walked toward her with gift boxes in hand, looking desolate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of the person in white she glimpsed when leaving, Queenie knew they had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the gift box in their hands, she widened her eyes. It was an expensive dress. She thought, "Are they going to give Diana an expensive dress?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She mocked, "Ms. Barnes, is this the gift you're giving your daughter? Too bad, she might not appreciate it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula and Eric didn't expect to run into Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They clearly saw her leave from the other side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie did leave from the other side, but she realized she was heading in the opposite direction of home, so she turned back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the unsent gift, Paula's eyes dimmed. She hadn't expected Diana to grow up in such a wealthy family, yet she had been so narrow-minded to have such thoughts about her biological daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could she think her biological daughter was unpresentable?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula chuckled bitterly and said, "She doesn't need to."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Queenie with tears in her eyes and continued, "I once treated you so well, gave you all my love, but what I got in return was your greed and harm. You made me realize that being good doesn't always bring good in return."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana is different. She's a truly kind girl, she's just angry with me for now. One day, she'll acknowledge that I'm her mother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, karma always comes around. Let's wait and see."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A strange smile appeared on Paula's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that this month of calm signaled an approaching storm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sneered, "Paula, at your age, are you still this naive? People's sincerity changes in an instant. Just relying on your conscience might not get things done right."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In my memory, there must have been a misunderstanding. According to my plan, you should be in a mental hospital by now, and your four sons would be dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this point, I just want to know how you saw through my plan. And you schemed against my dad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula sneered disdainfully, "Why should I tell you? It's still uncertain who will die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric endured for a long time and said coldly, "Queenie, I heard your birthday was quite shabby, and you were interrupted while dining with Steven. Even though he's very wealthy, the gift he gave you is only worth one or two million dollars, right? That can't compare to Diana's gift at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was already jealous of the gift Diana received tonight. She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even finish her meal and came out to cool off. Now that Eric bluntly pointed it out, she was trembling with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Paula and Eric left, Queenie stood there motionless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The March wind brushed against her face, still carrying a slight chill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Queenie felt even more desolate inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand what was wrong with striving for her dreams.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1074.html">« Prev</a><a href="1076.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
