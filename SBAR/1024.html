"Here's what I don't get&mdash;why does Cecil follow your lead so easily? Why does he echo your words like a puppet? And why, of all people, would he call out to me for help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian met Diana's piercing gaze and hesitated for a split second. Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she was a highly trained hypnotist. Because Cecil had swallowed her drug, making it effortless to mold his thoughts, to bend him to her will, even in front of a crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had done this before&mdash;many times. And every time, it worked flawlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight would be no different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end of this, Cecil wouldn't just be a playboy. He'd be a heartless bastard who used his power to take what he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian feigned innocence, her voice soft and wounded. "Miss, Mr. Farley confessed. How is he blindly obeying me? I don't have that kind of influence over him. Yes, he's been drugged and isn't thinking clearly, but everything he said&mdash;it all came from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And soon, this woman&mdash;Diana&mdash;would be dragged down too. She had sided with Cecil. Now she'd share his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind?" the same man from earlier in the crowd snapped. "Cecil admitted it himself! He's the one who tried to take advantage of her, and you're still defending him? What, was this whole thing your idea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't backing down, fueling the fire even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie seized the moment, stepping forward with a practiced look of concern. "Everyone, I think we should acknowledge something. This is my stepsister, Diana. There's been some tension between us, but let's not ignore the facts&mdash;her relationship with Cecil is well-known. Their families are business partners, and she has every reason to protect him. She's trying to minimize the damage to his reputation and their company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie paused for dramatic effect, then turned to Diana, her voice thick with emotion. "Diana, please, I'm begging you. Don't be this cruel. Don't let an innocent girl suffer just to cover for him. We get that you want to help Cecil, but does it really have to be at her expense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't even glance at Queenie's theatrics. Instead, her attention stayed locked on Lillian. "You're making a big scene about Cecil supposedly trying to assault you. Fine. So let's cut to the chase&mdash;what do you want? Money? Something else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hush fell over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew she had spoken the truth. But this was an opportunity&mdash;a chance to pull the Farley family down. No one would pass that up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bringing down Cecil meant tearing open the cracks in his family's empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana's bluntness? That didn't sit well with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's face darkened, her voice steely. "I want ten million dollars. And a public apology. Everywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's brows lifted slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow. That's a steep price tag. Ten million dollars for a touch? You must think you're priceless. And an apology, too? After what you pulled? Why exactly should Cecil apologize to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't buying it. Not for a second. And she still hadn't figured out how Lillian had managed to control Cecil so completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's jaw clenched. "You&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're impossible," Yanson sneered from the sidelines. "Don't think just because you and Cecil are in this together, you can sweep this under the rug. We all know you're the real mastermind. You've always been scheming against Queenie. Always bullying her. And now, with all these people watching, you still won't admit it? You're beyond shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen stood off to the side, quiet as ever, just watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the truth&mdash;knew Diana wasn't the villain here. But acknowledging that? That was another story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze slid toward Yanson, irritation flickering beneath the surface. What was his deal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, you do realize slander is a crime, right? Queenie's standing right here. If she's so confident in her version of events, why doesn't she say it to my face?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tolerate ignorance, but if you want to get involved in something like this, then I won't be letting it slide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice was calm, controlled&mdash;but the look in her eyes? That was a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson smirked, leaning in as if amused. "Diana, you shameless little thing. I'd love to see what you'll do to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave him a flat look. "Oh, that's easy. I'll have you arrested for defamation. Even a child could figure that one out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made it sound so simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot back, "What I'm saying is the truth. That's not defamation. And everyone here knows it." Yanson's gaze flickered toward Diana in her wheelchair, sitting there like she owned the room. He hated how unaffected she looked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one thing bugged him&mdash;where was Steven? Why wasn't he here tonight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had he sent Queenie alone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes flicked toward the staircase. Still no sign of Luna. Cecil was still out of it. She was on her own, facing a room full of people ready to tear her apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And worst of all? She was stuck in this damn wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cecil had taken the antidote. He should be waking up soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, wake up. Tell them this has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was clear, cutting through the noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil groaned, his body still weak. He slumped on the floor, struggling to focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The antidote was starting to kick in. His gaze sharpened slightly as he scanned the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his eyes landed on Diana, and relief flooded his face. "Diana, help me. Please. That woman&mdash;she drugged me. She smells so sweet... she's messing with my head... I feel sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze locked onto Lillian. "So it was you. You drugged him. You manipulated him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to buy time. She had called Luna, but there was still no answer. And that wasn't a good sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian barely flinched. It didn't matter anymore. The headlines were already out. Whether Cecil denied it or not, the damage was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted this scandal to explode. She wanted to see the Farley family scramble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By blowing this whole thing up on her own, Lillian was securing her future&mdash;more payouts, more leverage, and most importantly, a personal ATM in the form of the Farley family. Why wouldn't she go through with it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had said something that stuck with her&mdash;the people who hired her for this setup hadn't paid her the promised 200 thousand dollars upfront. Because that wasn't their endgame. Their real goal was to use this scandal to force the Farley family's hand and carve off half of their assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant tonight's plan had to work. There was no room for failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, you need to understand&mdash;he's not in his right mind..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana cut her off, her voice turning ice-cold. "Then you need to understand&mdash;if he wasn't in his right mind when he said he assaulted you, then how does that statement hold up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's breath caught. For the first time, her confidence wavered. Diana's cool, relentless logic was like a blade to the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's not&mdash;Mr. Farley already admitted&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I know what he admitted," Diana interrupted smoothly, watching as unease flickered across Lillian's face. She was stalling. Diana knew she was stalling. And that meant something was off with Luna, who hadn't answered any calls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But see, just now? Cecil also said you drugged him. You manipulated him. And the best part? Everyone here heard it."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1023.html">« Prev</a><a href="1025.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
