Joseph bluntly exposed her hypocrisy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie frowned and sneered, "Joseph, I chose you from hundreds of candidates because I recognize your talent. How can you make such speculations about me? Here's my phone number. Call me whenever you figure things out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're not satisfied with the 70-30 split, then let's make it 50-50. I don't want to take advantage of your accomplishments. Don't get me wrong. I genuinely want to help you." Her voice turned soft. She looked at him with a tender smile, finding him even more attractive than Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was too complicated. An 18-year-old boy like Joseph was more her type. He was stunningly beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had a fondness for beautiful things. His expressive eyes and relaxed posture made him stand out, yet also kept him at a distance, making people hesitant to approach him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt a desire to conquer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Marsh, haven't I made myself clear? Please leave," he said, his eyes gradually growing colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie caught a glimpse of his coldness, feeling confused about how an 18-year-old boy could have such an intimidating presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He seemed like a devil from hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before leaving, Queenie left her phone number, asking Joseph to call her once he made up his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Joseph simply tossed her number into the trash can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie walked away with a somber expression. Before leaving, she smiled eerily. Her twisted desire for revenge made her realize that if she couldn't have it, she would destroy it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph pressed his lips together. Even Diana had no demands for him, yet Queenie had gone too far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He scoffed and vowed that he would never betray Diana and would help her after he finished school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana entered only after she watched Queenie leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked, "Joseph, do you know Queenie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did Joseph realize that she was referring to the woman who had just left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shook his head. "No. She came to ask me to join her company, but I turned her down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and asked cautiously, "That sounds like a good chance. Why didn't you agree?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked at Diana with confusion. "Diana, I don't think she's a good person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a deep breath. In his past and present life, he still couldn't escape it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's the kind of woman who will destroy what she can't have. So, be careful when you see her next time," Diana reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She continued, "She's Queenie Marsh. You've seen the news and know that she and I are sworn enemies. She has frequently set traps for me, let alone an inexperienced young man like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Worry filled Diana's eyes. Even though she met Joseph first, he still couldn't escape Queenie's schemes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joseph, when you see me in public, don't say that you know me. Queenie admires your appearance. As long as you pretend not to know me, she won't harm you," Diana advised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked at her eagerly and asked, "Diana, do you really not need me to do anything for you? I'm really skilled with computers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She seemed to be aware of his abilities as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't notice his expression. She shook her head and replied, "You're still young. You should focus on your studies. As for work, once you finish your studies, you can go wherever you want. I won't ask for anything in return. After you graduate, you can work wherever you want.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And even though you're at the top of the industry, you have to understand that there will always be someone better than you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had found Joseph beforehand and helped him avoid Queenie because his ultimate fate wasn't a pleasant one either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie would abandon those who were no longer useful to her.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="368.html">« Prev</a><a href="370.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
