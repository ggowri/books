Despite his foolishness, he was still the child she had given birth to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was her firstborn, and it pained her to watch him remain so foolish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With exhaustion written all over her face, she asked, "Why did you call me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale apologized, "Mom, I'm sorry. I was blinded by foolishness before, but I'll be better from now on and won't hurt you again. Please don't send me abroad. I'll find a place to lay low and focus on learning how to run the company and be a better person. Mom, you're all alone now. I want to stay by your side and help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was sincere as he looked at his mother with hopeful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula let out a cold laugh. "It's too late. Do you know what I had to sacrifice for that 5% of the shares? Your grandfather had to sell an apartment so I could fill that gap."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had a plan. She handed him a transfer agreement and said, "I've found another way. If you sign this, I can return 5% of the shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you agree to transfer the shares to me, I won't send you abroad. You can receive treatment here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was the reason she came to see Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I already gave that transfer agreement to Dad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale," Paula glared at him, her heart filled with sharp pain. "I played that recording for you, but you didn't believe me. Now your legs are paralyzed, and you still don't trust me as your mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's voice trembled. "Do you know your father deliberately raised you to fail? That's why he indulged you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know why I don't want you? Because you're just as selfish as your father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's eyes reddened as she bit her lip, suppressing her anger. "And then there's Penelope. Since middle school, she's been drinking, partying, and going to clubs. Diana told you, but you didn't believe her. Three years ago, when you had that car accident, it was Diana who pulled you out of the car. Why do you choose to believe Queenie and not Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And while you were playing around with Penelope and her friends, Queenie worked hard. She's the most outstanding person in our family, making your four brothers look like mere foils. Look at your peers among the rich second generation. Take Cecil, for instance. He raced cars but earned a dual degree in economics overseas. When he returned, he landed the CEO position because he had the skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what do you have? You have no skills, and you're straightforward but extremely selfish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides racing, what else do you have to show?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I tried to make your study properly, but you complained about me being overbearing. So I let you have your freedom, thinking that at least the wealth accumulated by our ancestors would keep you fed. I was put by your father, too. Whenever I tried to discipline you, he'd say, 'We have plenty of money. Let him live freely.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie even chimed in, 'Mom, he has his dreams. Let him pursue them.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Gale, these past years, you've had all the freedom and got to race cars, which you enjoy. But do you really think you've achieved freedom?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="246.html">« Prev</a><a href="248.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
