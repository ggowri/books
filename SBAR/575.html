From now on, we'll handle the company matters behind the scenes. We can't let Queenie catch wind of anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda, brimming with confidence, replied, "Don't worry, I've got everything lined up. Queenie is going to be so furious, she'll be beside herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula took a deep breath, her thoughts drifting to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "How did I get so blinded? How could I even think about cutting ties with my own daughter to coddle the daughter of a mistress?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my own stupidity that's left me spinning in Jeff's web."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the food arrived, Elina nudged Paula, urging her to eat. "Come on, don't dwell on it. We need to keep moving forward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the courthouse, Jeff looked like a shell of his former self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swayed slightly, feeling as if he had aged a decade overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Is this really the end for me? Is my life over? No, there has to be another way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Paula's already divorced you. You need to marry Mom quickly and give her a proper title. I don't want to be known as the illegitimate child or the daughter of a mistress. I'm the rightful heiress of the Marsh family, and I need it to be official so I can marry Steven with peace of mind," Queenie insisted, her voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sighed, feeling cornered. "Queenie, I'm divorced from Paula, then about Mr. Edward Gellar..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie calculated her next plan carefully. "Dad, leave the rest to me. You're under the weather; focus on resting. Also, send Grandma and Grandpa back to the countryside. I don't want them around. You know how domineering Grandma is&mdash;I can't have her bullying Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula's willing to give Grandma a hefty allowance each month, but even with that, Grandma still made her life miserable. Mom doesn't have the money to keep her in line, and even if they're family, money can create conflict."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those two old folks have outlived their usefulness; it's time for them to go back to where they belong," Queenie thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff froze, suddenly recalling Paula's warning&mdash;Queenie wouldn't be as easy to manipulate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pain shot through him. "Queenie, is this how it's going to be? You just got what you wanted, and now you want to kick your grandparents out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie met his questioning gaze with a cold smile. "Dad, don't you realize that all the Marsh family members are just bloodsuckers? Why should you let them drain your resources?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've worked hard for my money; why should I support them? They're perfectly capable of taking care of themselves. From now on, it's just our little family of four. If you want to take care of those other people, then you can move out and live with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff hesitated; he knew they were on the brink of losing everything if he did so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at his daughter's unyielding expression, feeling a sense of regret wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff thought, "Should I have trusted Queenie and abandoned the Barnes family?</span><span> </span><span>Paula's father has connections. What if he suddenly turns things around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, are you planning to cut me loose once you've used me up?" Jeff's voice trembled. He had weathered many storms in his life, and he knew his daughter well&mdash;she had always been self-serving, using every trick in the book to undermine Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie chuckled, her eyes glinting with a chilling resolve. "Dad, why would you think that?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="574.html">« Prev</a><a href="576.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
