She lay lifeless on the freezing floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige..." Diana ran over and hugged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's body was icy, and her face was purple. She lost consciousness with her eyes shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly took off her down jacket and gave it to Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stopped her. "Diana, put on your down jacket, and I will give her my coat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. My down jacket can warm her up faster. Please call an ambulance. I want to take her to the hospital immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was very anxious, but she tried her best to calm herself down and looked at Paige's lifeless face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never seen Paige like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had always been lively. Though slightly chubby, she was always optimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the pursuit of Frank, indeed, she was not very confident and simply followed him about.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he disliked her, so she kept her distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was excellent. It was Frank who didn't deserve her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After losing his memory, he was in the hospital for treatment. His aorta was injured. He was rescued but nearly disabled.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched Diana quickly put her down jacket on Paige. Frowning slightly, he quickly dialed the emergency number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up and then called Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was confused. Why didn't Evan answer the phone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called Evan three more times, but still no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were chilly. "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to get through to Evan, he put his phone back into his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was rubbing Paige's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With tears in her eyes, she encouraged Paige. "Paige, you must hold on. We can go to the hospital soon. You must hold on, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's body was cold, and her eyelids didn't even move. Diana didn't know if she could hear her. At that moment, she just wanted Paige to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana put Paige's hands down, searched in her bag, and took out a pill, a very precious life-saving medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, she fed it to Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven found the pill very familiar. It suddenly occurred to him that when he was seriously ill, Diana took out such pills and fed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered softly in his ear, "Steven, after taking the medicine, you will be able to survive. You must persevere and try your best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven still remembered that the doctor had said that such pills were very expensive and precious life-saving medicines and that they could not be bought even with money.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana give the pill to Paige without hesitation, he stared at Diana deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would do her best to sincerely repay those who were nice to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven used to be the most important person in Diana's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a deep regret. Even though it was too late, he would not give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, help her up. I'll carry her upstairs. There's heating upstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice trembled. She did not hesitate. At least with Steven's help, Paige could get treatment quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had been frozen unconscious. Diana was really worried about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and Diana helped her up. He squatted down slightly, picked her up on his back, and walked towards the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was too anxious to mind the cold. She followed him, praying that Paige would make it.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the first floor of the hotel, there was heating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few minutes, Diana shivered from the chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands shook, and she tried to hold her phone steadily and called Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no one answered.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="852.html">« Prev</a><a href="854.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
