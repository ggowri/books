Remember your identity. Now, you are no longer of any use. Now, you have two choices. Either you get out of Capitole, or I will ask someone to send you away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank smiled evilly, looking indifferent yet cold, full of calculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana understood that Frank had inherited Jeff's viciousness. He was simply heartless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was cruel to Diana because he doted on Queenie, but the main reason was that Diana couldn't bring the Marsh family any benefits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, I won't leave. You can use whatever means you want. You have framed me over and over again, and I have evidence. If you slander me like this again, I will make the evidence public." Diana looked cold and resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tsk, Diana, do you think anyone would believe you, a woman with no power? How dare you threaten me? It's your honor to be Queenie's stepping stone," Frank sneered sarcastically. He knew how to hurt Diana's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana suddenly showed a strange smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "This idiot. I don't even need to provoke him before letting him tell the truth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was furious. Why did she have to bear all the grievances alone? Those who had bullied her should be scolded by others just like she had suffered in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank and Queenie had very similar personalities. They liked to use such means, taking advantage of the public opinion on the Internet, to force a person to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Diana's previous life, Frank had treated her like this, and his means were extremely vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank felt strange. "Diana, what are you laughing at? No matter what you do, I won't recognize you as my sister. My sister is Queenie. You must be available at any time and serve her forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The viewers in the stream couldn't stand it. [Damn it! Who is this bastard? He is really sharp-tongued.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[He is Frank Marsh, the second heir of the Marsh family. He is so disgusting and vicious. It turns out that his family adopted a daughter to make her a stepping stone for Queenie.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Frank looks gentle, but he is actually so shameless in private.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Isn't Queenie Steven's ex-girlfriend? A few days ago, Steven invested in a film for her. Is Queenie going to act in a film? She takes advantage of her Diana and wants to be a star.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The comment area was filled with curses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven watched the livestream and narrowed his eyes, thinking, "Frank is so stupid. He exposed himself and even ruined Queenie's star career."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the film could be shot, Queenie's reputation had been ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie tried desperately to call Frank, but the call couldn't be connected. She didn't even bother to care about her elegance in front of Steven, went straight downstairs, and drove to Frank's company in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's assistant suddenly broke into the office, and Diana had already ended the livestream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The netizens imagined what would happen next in excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Marsh, the conversation just now has been live streamed." The assistant looked at Frank nervously.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="293.html">« Prev</a><a href="295.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
