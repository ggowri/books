"I... I&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't give her a chance to recover. Her voice was sharp, cutting through the noise. "What's the hesitation? Everyone here heard it. Let's forget for a second how you managed to get Cecil to follow your every word. But you think you can use a man who's completely out of it as your proof? That's pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget&mdash;while supposedly attacking you, he was begging me for help. Make it make sense. You fed him those words while he was drugged. You're the real manipulator here. You're the one with no shame."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words were razor-sharp, slicing straight to the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud! Yanson kicked Diana's wheelchair with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent her toppling over, crashing hard onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hit the cold floor, pain shooting up her arm where it scraped against the edge of her chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson stood over her, his face twisted with rage. "You vile little snake. You deserve this. The evidence is right in front of us, and you're still defending him? You're just as disgusting as he is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glanced at Yanson, watching as his rage spiraled. What a fool&mdash;so easy to manipulate. She had anticipated his reaction, which was why she had carefully fed him her worries in advance, making sure he knew exactly what to expect. He had assured her he wouldn't let Diana get the upper hand. And sure enough, he was delivering on that promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Diana had cut the Hastings family out of the deal, Yanson had been seething. He had hated her for a long time, and now she was finally getting what she deserved. And this? This was just the beginning. Yanson wasn't done with her yet&mdash;Diana was going to suffer, again and again. He would make sure of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen stepped forward, his tone low and controlled. "Yanson, think before you act. You don't even know the full story yet. Don't let your anger make you..." He didn't finish that last sentence, but the message was clear. Don't be Queenie's tool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had been keeping an eye on Queenie and Steven lately, and something about them felt different. Steven became less decisive and less powerful. Something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson yanked his arm free from Owen's grip, glaring down at Diana with contempt. "Diana, even if you've got the whole damn Gellar empire behind you, so what? You think you can actually run a company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana clenched her teeth against the pain and met his stare with an icy calm. "Yanson, you really want to know why I cut your family out of the deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists tightened. That was the one question he needed an answer to. His fury over it had been festering for months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could speak, Nick stepped through the crowd. His eyes landed on Diana, still on the floor, and his face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swept a slow, burning gaze over the rest of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bunch of privileged animals in expensive suits, watching like this was a show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, let me help you," Nick said, his voice steady but laced with anger. "Are you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He righted the wheelchair first, then carefully lifted Diana and placed her back in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at her hand, where the metal frame of the chair had cut deep into her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drops of blood trickled onto the pristine white marble floor. The sharp sting of the wound pulsed beneath her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick, as Diana's bodyguard, always carried a small first-aid kit with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled it from his pocket, swiftly applying antiseptic and a bandage. His movements were efficient and practiced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana! Somebody get a doctor, now!" Cecil's hoarse voice rang out in distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick's voice was cool and firm. "Mr. Farley, I've stopped the bleeding. She'll be fine. Focus on yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil groaned, his whole body trembling. He wanted to do something&mdash;anything&mdash;but he was too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nick, call the cops," Cecil gasped, clutching his head. "I can't take this&mdash;call them. Get her arrested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was unbearable. His whole body felt like it was being devoured from the inside, like fire and needles and razors all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned. He had taken the antidote. So why was the poison still affecting him this badly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring him to me," she ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing her skills, the bodyguards hauled Cecil toward her, half-supporting his weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana grabbed his wrist and checked his pulse. Her frown deepened. His heart was pounding&mdash;too fast, too erratic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin was burning. Even the heat radiating from his hand was scalding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her head and locked eyes with Lillian. "What exactly did you give him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian put on a smug smile. "What could I have possibly given him? I wouldn't dare feed Mr. Farley anything. You were the one who gave him the pill, weren't you? You said it could neutralize any poison. So tell me, Diana&mdash;why does he look worse now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice dripped with mock innocence, but her eyes gleamed with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson let out a low chuckle. "So, Diana... turns out you're the one who poisoned him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fist slammed into his jaw. Nick's punch landed hard, sending Yanson stumbling backward. "Shut the hell up, you idiot. Your family's circling the drain, and you're still here running your mouth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're too dense to figure it out, let me help&mdash;your family got kicked from the Gellar Group because of you. You're a spineless fool who follows Queenie around like a lost puppy, believing every word she says. You're pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick had thrown his full strength into that punch. Yanson crumpled like a rag doll, out cold before he hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Owen called out at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's voice turned ice-cold. "Diana, is this how you handle things? Letting your guard dogs attack people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tilted her head, her expression unreadable. "Next time, it might be you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face twisted in fury. "You&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cops are here!" Someone shouted from the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked down at Cecil, then pulled another pill from her bag. She popped it into his mouth. She had underestimated the strength of the poison. Two pills were needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him a glass of ice-cold orange juice," she instructed the bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them immediately turned and called to a nearby server, "Bring a glass of iced orange juice! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A waiter rushed over with a tray, handing the glass to the bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's expression flickered. She lunged forward, trying to stop Cecil from drinking. But the bodyguard anticipated her move and landed a swift, brutal kick to her leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh&mdash;" Lillian yelped, collapsing onto one knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard stared down at her, his voice as cold as steel. "Try that again, and I'll make sure you never use that hand again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian glared at Diana, fury burning in her eyes. How the hell did she know orange juice could counteract the poison?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met her glare with a slow, knowing smirk. "What's the problem? I just want Cecil to have a drink. You didn't actually think orange juice was the antidote, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's voice was cold. "I have no idea what you're talking about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who called the police?" A uniformed officer stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised her hand. "That would be me. I'm reporting her for drugging and framing Mr. Farley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed directly at Lillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face contorted with rage. "Diana, are you insane? She's the victim, and you're having her arrested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to her, a flicker of amusement in her eyes. Queenie was panicking. Finally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved a hand in front of her nose. "Queenie, did you forget to use mouthwash this morning? Your breath is awful."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1024.html">« Prev</a><a href="1026.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
