She'd always dreamed of Steven giving her a bouquet of her favorite roses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roses whispered of love, of youthful romance. She'd yearned for that gesture, that sweet clich&eacute;, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle melancholy settled over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that it had finally happened, the thrill wasn't quite as sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she couldn't deny her inherent love for roses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their intoxicating fragrance, potent yet delicate, lingered in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accepting the bouquet with a soft smile, she murmured, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, his gaze fixed on her radiant face, returned the smile, "As long as you like them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprise flickered in her eyes as she asked, "What brought this on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw roses in your study the other day," he explained. "I know you like them, so I picked some up for you. But I should probably mention that this is the first time I've ever given a woman roses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to the gesture of sending roses, he had never once bestowed such a romantic token upon any other woman. But Diana was the first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "What exactly did he mean by that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he never given Queenie flowers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't recall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed the thought away, deciding not to ask. It would only spoil the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she placed the roses on the table, she took in Steven, who was dusted with snowflakes from the cold outside. "Go on up and wash up," she said, gesturing towards the stairs. "Dinner's ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded, his eyes lingering on her happy expression. Just seeing her smile lifted his spirits. "Okay," he replied gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused, struck by the gentle affection in that simple "okay." She pressed her lips as she hurried back to the kitchen to finish plating the meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched as she busied herself in the kitchen. With a quiet smile warming his gaze, he turned and made his way upstairs to change his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved with a swift grace, shedding his day's attire for something more comfortable, and before long, he was descending the stairs with the same urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a certain magic in knowing that Diana awaited him at home. With Diana there, every corner of the house seemed to whisper "home". It was as if her presence alone could transform any space into his sanctuary, where he longed to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he stepped into the dining room, Diana had meticulously laid out the utensils for his use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, she had a penchant for greens. Shrimp scampi was one dish that could claim the title of her favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fell on the spicy tacos, noticing the minimal chili. They weren't fiery but rather tailored to a milder spice level that danced harmoniously with his taste buds. As always, her cooking was just the way he liked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He devoured two generous plates of tacos, feeling pleasantly full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something was different. Before, Diana would always find topics to chat about during dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always assumed she was trying too hard, and his responses had been consistently indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he realized she hadn't been trying to impress him but simply engaging in easy conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, during meals, she maintained a serene silence, indifferent to whether his appetite was merely sated or thoroughly indulged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gone were the days when each word she spoke at the table was laced with a constant check on his well-being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven wore a bitter smile. He'd pushed her away, and now, he had to win her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he'd finished, Diana cleared the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Christmas approaching, Steven was swamped with work and headed upstairs for a video conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana rose from her seat, making her way to the kitchen to tackle the aftermath of their meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The task took a good hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, she stood gazing at the roses Steven had given her. Spotting a vase on the cabinet, she rinsed it in the bathroom, filled it with water, and carefully arranged the roses inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She placed the vase on the table in the living room. The flowers instantly brightened the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft smile touched her lips as she headed upstairs to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the evening stretching before her, devoid of obligations, she indulged in sketching designs. Eventually, she tucked her drawings away and proceeded to wash up, readying herself for the comfort of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waking the next morning, she registered the familiar presence beside her but didn't dwell on it. Winter was her season for hibernation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had slept deeply and woke feeling refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After showering and dressing, she went to the walk-in closet to choose an outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had stocked the closet with clothes for her. Within ten minutes, she had chosen a comfortable casual ensemble, slipping into the fabric with ease. No sooner had she dressed than her phone broke the silence with its ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up the phone, her eyes catching the caller ID from the police station. A slight sigh escaped her lips. "Poor Jean." She murmured to herself, "so naive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello? Is this Ms. Bishop?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="813.html">« Prev</a><a href="815.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
