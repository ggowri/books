She will no longer interfere in your company or your personal affairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank couldn't believe it. He blinked in shock and shed tears, thinking, "Is my mom serious? Why did she do this to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly wiped away his tears, looked at his assistant, and said, "Ask the public relations department to solve it. I can't let anything happen to my only company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant lowered his head and didn't respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank said coldly, "What are you standing there for? Just do as I said and suppress the news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant shook his head, looking distressed. "Mr. Marsh, it's useless. You can't recall what you just said in the livestream. Everyone knows that your family adopted Diana to let her be Ms. Marsh's stepping stone. Besides, those photos were retouched. Some people can see it at a glance. The situation has reversed. People know that you schemed against Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out! No matter what methods you use, you must suppress the news." It was the first time that Frank suffered such a loss. For a while, he didn't know what to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had managed the company. Whenever something went wrong, she would step forward to resolve it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Paula gave Frank up this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was in a panic. "I'm going to see Steven. You go and suppress the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He returned to the office, took the car keys, and went to see Steven. In his view, two people could help him solve all his problems. He would go to Paula for ordinary matters and to Steven for serious problems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Frank's eyes, Steven was someone he could call upon at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana got in the car and looked at Luna with tears in her eyes. "Luna, I have such a relative. It's painful, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was straightforward. She said angrily, "Diana, those people don't deserve to be your family. Just ignore them. They scheme against you and abandon you when you are of no use to them. Diana, don't be angry. Let's eat something delicious, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head and smiled, "No. We've just eaten. Go back to work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rumors were dispelled, and next, she had to make sure the fashion show could be a success.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie could no longer be an actress, and Diana wanted Queenie to embark on the path of her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana wanted to find out the man behind Queenie and prevent him from hurting Julius.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna drove back to the company, and Diana received a call from Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, are you all right?" Alexander was worried about Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled calmly, "I'm fine, Alexander. I'm going back to the company now. Don't worry. I can protect myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was relieved. "Okay! I'll wait for you downstairs of your company. See you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, "See you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after, Paige, Althea, and Tobias all called Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt moved and calmed them down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Internet was abuzz with netizens' discussions about the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Netizens accused Frank roundly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank experienced the feeling of being scolded severely for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, when he saw netizens' curses of Diana, he enjoyed the pleasure of bullying her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But today, Frank had been scolded as a bastard and a monster by the netizens, and some of them even cursed him to go to hell. Seeing these comments, he felt angry but unable to explain that it was Diana's conspiracy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, he was the first to slander Diana on the Internet. He finally knew the feeling of being scolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank thought, "But if Diana had surrendered and agreed to go back to her country life, how could I have treated her like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Frank's car arrived downstairs of Steven's company, he received a call from Gale.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="295.html">« Prev</a><a href="297.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
