What do you want?" Diana asked impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Levi was the center of attention. With his innate elegance, he looked at her fiercely. "I want you to apologize to Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana grinned and replied indifferently, "Apologize? Ask Queenie if she wants an apology. She always causes trouble for me and tries to kill me. Do you think she dares to demand it from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt panicky. Diana was now fearless. She still remembered Diana saying that she would drag her to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She might be serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie stood up, feeling very embarrassed. Her hands hurt, but she tried her best to endure it and smiled, "Levi, it doesn't matter. Diana didn't do it on purpose. She was just displeased with being kicked out of the Marsh family because of her scheme against me. She has no one to rely on now, and it's okay that she wants to vent her anger to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, my goodness! What a bitch! Queenie, you are really eloquent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige glanced at Levi. "Congratulations, Levi. A bitch is approaching you. Be careful. She will get you into trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a frown, he remained silent and stared at her icily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;However, Queenie secretly glared at Paige, wondering why she confronted her as Diana did.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to be an idiot who could only cry when Elsie framed her before. How could she provoke her in public like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie pretended to be innocent and slandered her. "Paige, I know you are upset that you can't marry Frank, but you can't insult me. Relationships require mutual affection, and I understand how painful it is that you failed to capture his heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige stomped her feet in a rage and took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could retort, Diana said, "Queenie, Paige broke up with Frank a year ago. She dumped him, so it was not that she didn't capture his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In order to force the Sutton family to give up their support for Frank, you have painstakingly made every effort to separate Paige and Frank. Your plan has succeeded. Do you still want to bully her now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really think you can win applause by playing such tricks? Queenie, time will expose your true colors."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at Levi again. "Levi, you have no right to interfere in the matter between Queenie and me. If you dare to hurt Paige, I will pay to play the video of Queenie hiring someone to kidnap me on the big screens all over in Capitole. Whether your movie can be broadcast depends on your luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she pulled Paige away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#8203;Levi felt that Diana was more stunning than Queenie, yet not as gentle.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were several unfavorable trending topics about Queenie before, but they were all whitewashed later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was hype involved, but if it were true, the consequences would be serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie tried to plot against Diana. In the end, she was frightened by Diana's words. At that moment, she was smart enough not to defend herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But someone would speak for her. Penelope stamped her feet furiously. "Levi, don't believe Diana's nonsense. She is the adopted daughter of the Marsh family. After being kicked out, she has nothing. She just can't stand seeing Queenie doing well."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="392.html">« Prev</a><a href="394.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
