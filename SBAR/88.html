Why are you doing this to me?" Queenie got more and more aggrieved as she cried her eyes out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope was also defending Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, haven't you gotten divorced a long time ago? Someone like Diana doesn't deserve you, but Queenie is pure and noble, and she is perfect for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Penelope indifferently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope pursed her lips, lowered her head, and dared not speak again. Steven was indifferent and terrifying, and he only became gentle when he was with Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was so furious that she crouched on the floor and cried.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that, Penelope took out her cell phone and called Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, why don't you come back soon? Queenie is being bullied by Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale had been preparing for racing lately. Hearing Penelope's words, he was outraged. "Penelope, what did Diana do to upset Queenie again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because Diana was seducing other men outside. She was caught by Mr. Gellar on the spot, but she blamed Queenie for being nosy. Come back soon, and I miss you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope looked shy, but her eyes were actually filled with evil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, Penelope, I'll be back today. Tell Queenie not to feel upset, and when I get back, I'll help her teach Diana a lesson. I'll be back today."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope smiled happily when she heard this as she tugged on Queenie's shirt. "Queenie, don't cry. Gale said he would be back tonight to avenge for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's eyes showed a hint of surprise. "Okay! Thanks for Gale for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope talked with joy for a while and hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled viciously and thought that people like Diana didn't deserve to be with them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was just like a bedbug in the gutter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was nothing like them about Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie wiped her tears away. What was she afraid of when she had Gale to help her </span><span>fix</span><span> Diana?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale was impulsive. Seeing Diana, he would have slapped her in the face. Queenie could get complete revenge for the grievances she had suffered today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, Penelope, let's go for dinner."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of what Diana was going to suffer tonight made Queenie happy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Diana was being beaten by her biological brother, she would be in a lot of pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope rubbed her belly, and it was time to tell Gale the truth about what had happened tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, I want to confess something to you tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie glanced at her belly and smiled, "You should have done it a long time ago."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was relieved when she signed the contract with Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Money could make the world go around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a generous reward, there would definitely be brave people who would take up the challenge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Employees would only work hard if they were treated well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna made her a cup of coffee and brought it in, placing it on a side table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She reminded Diana, "Ms. Bishop, you've been working for five hours in a row, and it's time for a break. You should give your eyes a rest, and I have prepared coffee and dessert."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked up from her computer and looked at Luna, who was calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the date today?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "Ms. Bishop, it's August 16th."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "August 16th?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That seems to be the day Gale came back."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="87.html">« Prev</a><a href="89.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
