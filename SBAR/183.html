"Mr. Gellar, are you going to watch Ms. Bishop be humiliated?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned, "What do you mean by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna sneered, "Isn't it clear what I'm saying? Such a vicious tactic. Isn't it your favorite, along with the Marsh family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan tried to explain first, "Luna, you're mistaken. Today's incident has nothing to do with Mr. Gellar. We're also here to deal with the bar's issue."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Without Steven's indulgence and that group of unscrupulous people from the Marsh family, how could Ms. Bishop get hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna snorted, "Her husband subjected her to emotional abuse, and her family looked down on her. She was so excellent, yet she almost lost her life for that so-called love and familial affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, when you were blind two years ago, Diana personally went to the mountains to find medicine for you. She risked her life to climb the cliffs to get the best medicine for you, barely making it back alive, and almost got bitten by a venomous snake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you think your eyes could be cured after such a severe impact? They couldn't. The doctors had already given you a death sentence. But Diana didn't let anyone tell you. Evan knows, too. He was the one who fetched the report. Diana asked her teacher for the prescription. With the prescription, she still had to find the medicine herself because ordinary pharmacies didn't have such precious herbs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She continued, "Diana and I went to find the medicine for you. We lived in the mountains for ten days to gather all the herbs you needed. At that time, Diana was thinking every day about how to cure your eyes and legs, but what about Queenie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna paused here. After thinking for a moment, she added, "What Diana did doesn't need to be compared with anyone else. To even mention Queenie in the same breath with her is an insult. She has a clear conscience towards you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan also said, "Now I remember. During those ten days, I was taking care of Mr. Gellar. Ms. Bishop said Madam Farley found a very good doctor, but this doctor had a peculiar temperament and was unwilling to come. She went to plead with the doctor to come, and it took about ten days to return. Are you talking about that time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna nodded coldly. "Yes, that's the one. It was winter on a mountain nearly a thousand feet above sea level. The herbs were in the snow on the cliffs. I didn't recognize the herbs and couldn't help her. All I could do was ensure she had three meals a day. I hunted a wild boar to provide her with enough calories every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"One day, she went to the highest altitude to find the most essential herb and was attacked by wolves. She almost had an accident. She came back with her hands bloody. The nights were terribly cold, and we huddled in a cave. Diana always held onto a glimmer of hope, thinking that once you got better, you would fall in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's all because Ms. Bishop used the best medicine in the world for you that your eyes and legs recovered so quickly. It was a lost secret formula, something money can't buy. That's why your eyes didn't leave any sequelae. After you got better, your eyesight was even better than before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What Diana did for Steven and the Marsh family was far more than this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These people were all ungrateful creatures.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="182.html">« Prev</a><a href="184.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
