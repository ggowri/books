That time, the words she spoke were the harshest she had ever uttered in her life, and the one who heard them was her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Diana has always been very kind. As long as we persist, she will surely see our sincerity," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula wiped away her tears. Now that she had some free time, she also had to plan for the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, Mrs. Foliot suddenly had an accident, and it must have something to do with her husband and Amelie. But now, Mrs. Foliot's whereabouts are unknown. I've sent people to look for Mrs. Foliot, but they can't find her," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Have you heard any news from Queenie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I haven't heard anything about Mrs. Foliot, but Queenie is pregnant. I also heard that she deliberately called to tell Diana that the child she is carrying is Steven's."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Paula's face was filled with pain. Her eyes were swollen from crying as she looked at Eric and asked, "Where is Diana? She loves Steven so much; she would be very sad to hear this."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric shook his head. "I don't know where she lives or if she went to work today. But Diana doesn't want Steven anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric also regretted that he had done many excessive things to Diana for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie manipulated them one by one, and they acted like foolish pigs, begging her to use them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula narrowed her eyes, suppressing the pain in her heart, and said in a low voice, "Diana will feel better after giving up on the people who she once loved deeply but hurt her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just can't figure out why Steven suddenly decided not to get a divorce?" she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly stood up and said, "Call Evan now and ask if Steven is in the office."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric said, "He's not in the office. I saw Steven taking Diana away outside the police station. They should be together now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snorted, "That damn man. If he doesn't love Diana, why won't he let her go? I think Alexander and Diana would be a better match."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't watch Steven waste Diana's youth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula took out her phone, intending to call Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Eric stopped her. He said, "I know what you're trying to do, but even if we get involved, Steven won't get a divorce. I heard there's an agreement that is very unfavorable to him, and it seems he can't divorce Diana. Mom, let's wait and see how things develop. I feel like this situation will continue to escalate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie was exposed to being pregnant with Levi's child. The person who exposed this information is likely not simple. Let's wait and see.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm currently Queenie's driver and can hear a lot of her secrets. Once, I overheard her talking with Mario, and Mario referred to someone as 'the master'.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The person behind Queenie is also not simple. Mom, we still need to be cautious. Queenie is truly ruthless. The Staggs family has already gone bankrupt because of her schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasmine's parents have taken Jasmine away from Capitole, and Diana, with the help of Cecil, is temporarily out of danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula asked excitedly, "Really? Are you sure she will be fine?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="703.html">« Prev</a><a href="705.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
