"Ms. Marsh, Cecil and Rita went to testify for Diana. Cecil was not in good health last night. Diana went to the Farley Manor and took care of Cecil all night. The Farley family provided a video, and Diana has evidence of her absence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for whether Mrs. Foliot is dead or alive, no one knows. When I went there, the Farley family has already provided evidence. They're faster than us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shaking in anger. There were tears in her eyes. She asked with a choked voice, "Mario, why did it become like this? We were obviously successful. But I feel like we have lost everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt uncomfortable. At this moment, she was as cold as ice, and there was no warmth in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie didn't love Queenie at all. All she loved was money.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to protect Amelie's dignity, Queenie wanted to let Amelie live with Jeff openly. But everything was different from what Queenie had expected, and Queenie was not happy now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said, "Ms. Marsh, wait a moment. Maybe there will be a turn for the better. Jace and Mr. Gellar will not ignore you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie closed her eyes in pain and whispered, "Go and suppress the trending search. I've been set up by that bitch Moira."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario looked at her painful back and felt distressed. He thought, "She is smart, but she is too eager for quick success and always achieves bad results.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all we can do is wait. I'm afraid she can't become a celebrity anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario smiled grimly, "It has been suppressed. Leave the rest to Samuel. He will start soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt relieved then. After Samuel was released, his resentment was even more significant. He would push Diana into an irretrievable situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Diana was taken to the police station, Cecil and Rita brought the video and went into the police station in the wind and snow to provide evidence. Diana then came out after taking the statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's daughter, Jean Foliot, was standing at the door. Seeing Diana coming out easily, she was furious. "Diana, do you think you'll be alright just because you came out? You'd better tell me where my mother is."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean looked like Lily, and her eyes turned red with anger. Diana looked at her deeply and said, "Ms. Foliot, what reason do I have to kill your mother? Is it because your mother exposed my affairs?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm a victim. I have nothing to do with what your mother exposed. Instead of suspecting me, you should suspect your father and Amelie. After their affair was exposed by your mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean interrupted her coldly, "Amelie is good to me. My mother never has patience with me. She is always harsh on me. She is not like Amelie. Amelie always goes along with me. If I want to eat ice cream, she buys it for me. If I want to go to a bar, she takes me to it. If I want to taste cigarettes, she smokes with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But my mother only forces me to study and grow up. I don't want to do that. My family is so wealthy. Why should I suffer that?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie is very good to me. Whenever I quarrel with my mother, she comforts me and says that my mother has a bad temper. She tells me that I just need to be patient and don't argue with my mother. My father and my mother are not a good match at all. I support my father and Amelie being together. At least Amelie will let me live a free life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And my mother only pushes me into a dead end." Jean was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned by Jean's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Therefore, Amelie is leading Jean astray, but Jean feels that Amelie is doing it for her own good.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she thinks her mom is doing her a disservice by forcing her to grow up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="692.html">« Prev</a><a href="694.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
