I funded half of your laboratory. Now, get out of my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was suddenly taken aback, thinking, "How can his investments be everywhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph frowned, thinking, "How could Steven have invested in the laboratory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana slightly pulled Joseph's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana..." Joseph looked at her worriedly, frustrated that he couldn't protect Diana right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled lightly, "It's okay, you all go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, the combined strength of the three men present was still not enough to stand up against Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were still growing, and under no circumstances should their company suffer a severe blow because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's scheme was really hard to perceive.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her with a gentle gaze. "Diana, if you don't want to go back with him, I'll take you back. I promised your elder brother that I would protect you well."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander meaningfully glanced at Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven just responded with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Alexander, thank you for coming over to help me today. But don't worry, I'm really fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rejection made Alexander feel a bit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana then looked at Cecil. "Cecil, could you take Joseph to the lab? It's hard to get a taxi around here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil, feeling both angry and helpless, could only agree with her, "Fine! Don't worry, I'll make sure to get this kid to school safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kid left the lab to come here and help Diana; his sincerity was truly precious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hardest times, those who were willing to help you were like a ray of sunshine piercing through the gloom. Diana felt sad, and that's why she came to understand this truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Steven and said, "Let go of me. I will go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also took this opportunity to get everything between them clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Steven did not let her go; instead, he pulled her into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three men looked despondently as Diana was taken away by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven directly drove back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was always proud and arrogant, looking down on everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very skilled in the business field.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was lukewarm to anyone except for his grandparents, and the person he cared about most was Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even if she were to live another life, because she lacks the strength, she still could not defy him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment of her rebirth, she was very sober and suppressed those feelings deep in her heart, no longer being swayed by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had she coveted men of high status and power, nor had she ever thought about taking shortcuts. All she wanted was a simple and genuine love.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Steven never paid any attention to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she were to seek cooperation with Alexander, she would do so based on her own capabilities. In this life, she wanted to live it out in a down-to-earth manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never thought of using anyone. The road ahead could be taken slowly, but it must definitely be the path she wished to take.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and the Marsh family would not be in the picture of her future.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana followed him to the living room. After they sat down, Steven, in a fit of anger, threw the car keys onto the coffee table.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana remained silent. She knew Steven was very busy, and one day, he would grow tired of such confrontations. All she needed to do was wait patiently; when he got tired of it, she would become even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her in silence, very angry. "Why do you want to divorce again? Also, I was not involved in what happened today."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil made accusations against him without any evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, that jerk really liked to sow discord.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned at him and said, "Then why don't you get a divorce? Queenie called me and said she's pregnant with your child, telling me to get out of your house.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really, really don't want to get involved in your affairs, nor do I want to make life so hard for myself. So, please go with me to get a divorce tomorrow morning. No matter what kind of grudge exists between the three of us, please treat the child well; the child is innocent," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's deep pupils quivered, and he said in disbelief, "What did you say?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="695.html">« Prev</a><a href="697.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
