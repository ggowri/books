Her pitiful look and soft voice made him feel sick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, Steven hid his emotions well. To everyone else, he seemed deeply in love with Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's expression turned colder. "If I didn't lie to you, how would I make you think I was in love with you? How would I get you to expose yourself and bring George back from abroad?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I didn't lie to you, how would I uncover your ambition? How would I find out about your deal with Charlie, or what you're really up to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every word he said shattered Queenie's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie felt truly wronged. She still couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t figure out how he died after Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s death in the last life. She was even confused about who died first&mdash;Diana or Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, if she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have Steven, she swore she</span><span>'</span><span>d make sure Steven and Diana died together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie glanced at Diana standing nearby. She was still stunning. In fact, being deeply loved by Steven made Diana even more beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana caught her cold, jealous gaze and responded with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt nothing but hatred for Queenie, but she wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t scream or argue with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath and turned to Steven. "Steven, if you</span><span>'</span><span>ve always loved me..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven cut her off, "That</span><span>'</span><span>s not even a possibility. My kindness to you was always based on how much information you could provide me. Even if I gave you $5 million a month as an allowance, I</span><span>'</span><span>d take it all back from your company&mdash;with interest. So don</span><span>'</span><span>t talk to me about &lsquo;what ifs</span><span>'</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I care about results, not the process."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was never someone guided by principles or kindness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's face turned pale, and a faint ache crept into her legs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, by the way, do you know who broke your leg on Christmas Eve?" Steven asked, a smirk playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie froze for a moment, shocked. "It was you?" Her voice trembled as she stared wide-eyed at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When someone is too angry, all they can do is widen their eyes, leaving no room for any other emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Yes, it was me! Diana's terrified of pain. That car accident hurt her leg, and she cried so much. You had to hurt more than she did."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze. She knew Steven had someone break Queenie's leg on Christmas Eve, but she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know this was the reason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven, puzzled. "How did you know I cried?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She remembered feeling awful that day, sitting in the hall, yelling at him while tending to her own wound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze. "Steven, did you put cameras in the living room?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her surprised expression and laughed. "Yes. I was worried someone might hurt you. The villa is surrounded by cameras. Diana, seeing you cry broke my heart. So, on Christmas Eve, I had someone deal with Queenie and her husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned. So he had been secretly helping her all along.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cheered, "Good job! But you went too easy on her. You still couldn't bring yourself to really teach her a lesson."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sneered as she looked at Steven. He was dressed in a tailored black suit, perfectly fitted to his frame, highlighting his broad shoulders and long legs. He was undeniably charming like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, you actually stooped to something this despicable?" Her face twisted with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gaze was icy. "For someone like you, I can be even more despicable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's voice was deep, captivating, yet cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cold words made Queenie shudder slightly. To Steven, she was nothing more than a ruthless woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie glanced at the silent Diana and sneered, "Steven, looks like you've really fallen for this maid of yours, Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maid?" Steven's face darkened. "Diana is devoted to me, taking care of me in every possible way. And you? You're a vicious woman who runs at the first sign of trouble when there's no benefit to gain. What right do you have to judge Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You stole over a decade of her life, made yourself the daughter of a wealthy family, and yet you can't even take care of anyone. You don't deserve your status."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've seen plenty of shameless women like you trying to get close to me. You're just more shameless than the rest. What exactly are you so proud of?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was icy, sending a chill down Queenie's spine. Another truth hit her&mdash;she had thought Diana was the most disgraceful woman in his eyes. She was wrong. It was her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I've been by your side for years..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Companionship?" Steven sneered. "All you ever wanted was more money from me, more luxury goods. Just cheap companionship. You can</span><span>'</span><span>t even offer me emotional value. I can pay to get rid of you and still get a return on my investment. I lose nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's hands and feet went cold instantly. She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even dare to look at Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s mocking face. One thought consumed her&mdash;Steven had never liked her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana wanted a divorce, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t withhold money because he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t love her, but because he planned to give her all his assets in the end. Since they were married, transferring the property to her was legal. The Gellar Group now belonged to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's eyes burned with hatred. She thought she had outplayed Diana and Paula, but in the end, she realized she was the one who had been played.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She chose to come here to check on her injured leg just to run into Steven again. Even if Steven had the slightest interest in her, she was determined to take him away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was slowly falling apart. In her past life, Steven had trusted her, and she got everything she wanted. But now, she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand why this time, it was Diana who came out on top.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>No, I will never accept this outcome. Diana, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll make sure you suffer,</span><span>"</span><span> she hissed, glaring at Steven with burning eyes, vowing revenge. </span><span>"</span><span>Steven, one day, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll regret everything you</span><span>'</span><span>ve done.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie let out a cold laugh and walked away with Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned slightly. Die a horrible death? Wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t that when she was pushed down the stairs, and they both died together? The thought of that moment made her shudder uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a warm hand clasped hers, and a deep voice murmured in her ear, "Diana, I won</span><span>'</span><span>t let her hurt you again."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1110.html">« Prev</a><a href="1112.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
