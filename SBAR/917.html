"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana cut him off with a smile. "Sir Foliot, even if you're itching to blow your top, don't take it out on the innocent. Queenie was the one who introduced the woman to your son. Now, he's in trouble, and you want me to take the fall?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're quite the master at shifting blame, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget, you're not getting any younger. With your high blood pressure, you really shouldn't let your emotions get the best of you. A stroke could be lurking around the corner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Foliot family in this mess would surely benefit Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That crumbling enterprise would give her a headache if she took it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled sweetly at Jace, hiding a whirlwind of emotions beneath her calm exterior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie glared at Diana, thinking to herself, "What's with this little vixen? How did she suddenly become so formidable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jace's phone rang. It was his butler. He shot a glance at Diana before answering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Foliot, it's bad news. The police are at your house investigating. Mr. Nathan Foliot's wife has reported him for domestic violence and for exploiting female stars in the company. She's also implicated you in several illegal activities. You need to get back here, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Jace's mind raced in disbelief. He mused, "How dare Nathan's wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie observed Jace's changing expression, and her mind raced with plans to acquire the Foliot Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Nathan's wife making her move, the timing was perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, Queenie sent out a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Felicity responded swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Ms. Marsh, we've been keeping a close eye on the Foliot family. The drop in Foliot Group's stock is unusual. Someone's orchestrating this.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie furrowed her brow, thinking, "Who could act so quickly against the Foliot Group? They're moving faster than I am.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way, I've been eyeing that group for too long. It has to be mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie replied: [Seize the opportunity to acquire Jace's subsidiaries.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity responded: [Yes, Ms. Marsh!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the message, she noticed Jace staggering back a few steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Foliot." Queenie feigned concern, knowing he couldn't afford to crumble just yet. He needed to hold his ground until Andrew arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jace, furious, shoved her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped Queenie across the face. "Queenie, have I not treated you well enough? If it weren't for the comfort you provided in bed, I wouldn't be here backing you up today. But your ambition is out of control. You actually sent someone to get close to Nathan's wife, gathering evidence to push her to report him. Is this how you repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, and everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on them that Jace and Queenie had been involved in something so shady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George remained expressionless. The woman who had entered Jace's room was someone else entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noticed George's lack of reaction, and a subtle unease crept into her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically, he should be furious over such a scandal, yet he stood there, indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hadn't revealed the nature of Jace and Queenie's relationship. After all, she had no solid proof, just a video of them entering the room together and not coming out for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without concrete evidence, she could easily find herself on the receiving end of their wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised Diana was that Jace was the one to expose it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, with a sly smile, retorted, "Sir Foliot, what are you talking about? I've never been the one to cater to your needs; that's always been Rebecca."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Jace staggered back, shock written all over his face. "Queenie, did you plot against me? No wonder I've felt so groggy every time I wake up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shook her head, feigning innocence. "Sir Foliot, I didn't scheme against you. You simply couldn't resist the allure of a younger woman. Should I be blamed for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you... you're shameless! I never thought my life would end up in ruins because of you." Jace rolled his eyes in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a voice low enough for just the two of them to hear, Queenie leaned closer. "Sir Foliot, instead of wasting energy here arguing with me, you might want to get to a hospital. Rebecca has an STD, and after all those nights with her, you're likely infected, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace recoiled, disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you..." His eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head slightly, thinking, "You made your bed, and now lie in it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's assistant rushed to get him to the hospital. Panic was evident in his every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie watched the chaotic scene unfold, and her heart was filled with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Who reported Nathan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, was it you who reported Nathan?" Queenie demanded with sharp voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No, I don't meddle in other people's business. I'd rather not dirty my eyes with that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones suddenly stood up, and anger flashed in his eyes. "Ms. Marsh, you're not even part of this company. What are you doing here stirring up trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana interjected, "Mr. Flemming, hold on a second. Queenie and Mr. Gellar are just wasting their time. Due to certain circumstances, the Gellar Group has changed hands, and they've ended up with nothing. Now, they're trying to use Sir Foliot to sway the shareholders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he's passed out, let's move on to discussing company matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George exchanged glances, and their faces alternated between red and pale. They thought, "Damn Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew exactly how to rile them up while leaving them utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones squinted, scrutinizing Diana. If even Jace could faint from the pressure, then this calm, composed woman before him was certainly not the fool Queenie painted her to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, I don't care who sits in your chair as long as they can make me money. Now, let's talk about the company's future. But I think it's time for the irrelevant parties to step aside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Mr. Flemming, rest assured. Even if they stay, they won't be walking away with any company secrets. If Queenie insists on calling me illiterate, then let her see what a true genius looks like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Luna. "Luna, show them my diploma. Especially let Ms. Marsh see what a prodigy truly is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna beamed, and her smile was bright as she opened her laptop and projected the screen behind Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's a look at Diana's academic journey. She graduated from Raventia's top institution, Tosland University. By the age of 16, she had already completed all her college courses in record time, excelling in finance and design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last year, she didn't stop there. She pursued multiple degrees across various fields, making breakthroughs that shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her company, Nova Investment, is highly regarded in Capitole. On top of that, she speaks eight languages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the rest, everyone can gradually get to know them over time. For those who doubt, I've provided the school's address and phone number. Feel free to call and verify."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Luna finished her speech, Queenie felt a burning shame wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head in disbelief, staring at the screen. "No, this can't be right. There's no way Diana could be this exceptional!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="916.html">« Prev</a><a href="918.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
