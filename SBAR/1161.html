Chloe has to face the consequences of her mistakes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chloe, this was your choice. The entire process of you stealing the smart medical AI technology for Mario was recorded."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chloe, you will spend the rest of your life in prison."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe trembled all over. She thought she did well and wouldn't be easily caught.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she never expected that everything she did was under their surveillance and completely exposed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe apologized in front of Diana, "Ms. Bishop, I was wrong. Please, forgive me. I promise I won't do this again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "Tom and Joseph discovered this a long time ago. Since the special drug incident, you've had many chances, but you never changed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, the man standing next to you is Queenie's boyfriend. He buys you cars and houses because the technology you obtained is worth billions of dollars. What he gives you is just a drop in the ocean compared to what he'll earn in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chloe, how could you believe his words?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe suddenly looked at Mario and screamed, "Mario, is what Ms. Bishop said true? The one you love is Queenie, not me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe knew there was conflict between Queenie and Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario being Queenie's man means Chloe was used by Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario frowned at her. He knew he had no way out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop talking. Does it matter at this point?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe refused to stop. She cared about it deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Mario, your answer means a lot to me. The one you love is Queenie. You suddenly pursued me, gave me a car, a house, all for this technology, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No." Mario looked at Diana. Diana was clearly trying to drive a wedge between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "If I didn't love you, why would I buy you these things? Don't listen to Diana's nonsense. She's saying this on purpose to ruin our relationship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Mario and sneered. "Mario, it's too late for anything you say now. You and Queenie have always lived together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your relationship has long been no secret."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here's the video. Chloe, see how much they love each other."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And then think about why you ended up in this situation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana showed Chloe the video of Queenie and Mario together on her phone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only if Chloe accuses Mario of making her steal the lab project can Mario spend his life in prison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Mario has a long criminal record. His life is basically over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario tried to grab Diana's phone but got punched by Steven. Steven coldly warned him, "Don't touch my wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario glared at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, why are you pretending to be a good guy now? Don't forget you've spoiled Queenie for many years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he mockingly glanced at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, do you have no self-respect? Do you remember how Steven and Paula bullied you back then? If you've forgotten, let me remind you now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven hit you, insulted you, yet you still love him wholeheartedly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, Queenie is absolutely right. You're a woman with no self-respect and no self-love."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Has the hatred between you and Steven been softened by your love?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven clenched his fists. Mario was stating the truth, and he couldn't argue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This will be a painful memory for Steven his entire life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned. The happiness of this period had made her forget those pains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Mario brought it up, she still felt very sad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly looked at Diana, only to see her smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Mario, you don't need to stir up trouble. Although remembering the past is painful, Steven not loving me is not wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It was my one-sided love for him. I'm not like you. We're probably similar, though. From the day Queenie started supporting you, you fell for her. But she doesn't love you. No matter how much you give, all she sees are wealthy and powerful men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And in the end, you became her last choice. Because you're young, capable, and with no other options, she chose you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With her reputation, losing Paula's protection, she couldn't marry into a wealthy family, so you were just her last choice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana revealed another harsh truth to Mario. "Mario, after you're arrested today, Queenie won't save you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this world, no one understands Queenie's selfishness better than I do. Without you, she still has plenty of men like you willing to sacrifice for her. She doesn't care about you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as she gives others money, they'll be willing to help her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario, of course, knew Queenie was selfish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's words made him wonder if Queenie would save him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "No, I don't believe it. She knows I love her. No matter the cost, she will definitely bail me out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario suddenly saw Diana reveal a triumphant smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was then he realized he had been tricked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were cut off by Chloe. She shook her head in pain and shouted, "Mario, I did all this for you because I thought you loved me. So, no matter what you asked for, I would fulfill it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To play this role well, you even ate with me, walked me home. When we slept together, you always turned off the lights. You said you were shy. Now I finally understand, it wasn't shyness&mdash;it was because I wasn't Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From the very beginning, you despised me, brushed me off. Mario, I made mistakes because of love. If I didn't love you, I wouldn't have done these things for you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1160.html">« Prev</a><a href="1162.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
