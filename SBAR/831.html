Seeing her angry, he always felt inexplicably good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Diana, you are mean. It makes me want to kiss you hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being punished, she would become obedient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stood up, walked over, and sat next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana moved aside suddenly and looked at him warily. "Why are you so close to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Why does he suddenly come to my office?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, even if she disappeared for three days and three nights, Steven would not care about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was really afraid that Steven was plotting against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who were schemed against by Steven suffered a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her defensive eyes. His handsome face became gloomier. "Come here. I am here to discuss work with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head, unable to remember what work they had to discuss. "There is nothing to discuss between you and me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had always been steady, but he smiled when looking at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile was gentle and restrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "During the three years you signed a contract with our company, all of your design works and fashion styles are ours. You have already designed Alexander's works, so shouldn't you also prepare our spring styles?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came over to see her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was also for work. The last time she met Alexander was to give Alexander design drawings for new products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana almost forgot about this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was written in that contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very angry. Her eyes filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked mature and calm like he was in control of everything about her. That made her uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Mr. Gellar, you screwed me. If you hadn't stolen my designer director, I wouldn't have to come here. I could get rich doing nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to let Queenie let go of her grudge against her, Diana had always been very low-key and never took the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, everyone wants to be stronger." Steven's smile was ostentatious, and his temperament became more and more charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven went too far and even tried to cheat her with the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I see. I will give you the new product before Christmas. I will participate in a designer competition in a few days, so I will give it to you before the competition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana just had some inspiration and was really busy during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she was willing, Steven felt relieved. "Well! The clothes you designed are selling very well. I have appointed you as the company's chief designer. In the future, there will be no chief in the clothing department, only you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "That won't work. I am the director of this company now. You can find someone else. I will give you three years of design drawings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were any other company, they would have sued her long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, she could design different styles of clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought quietly. Diana was the designer he was looking for back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Then we'll talk about it in three years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still three years left. They had plenty of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's smile was calm, without any frivolity or impetuousness, but it made people feel at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a little surprised and thought, "Why does Steven make me feel this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had something else to do. Evan brought over the cake that Diana liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave the cake to Diana before he went to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was staring at the cake in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was strange that Steven had bought her a cake.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="830.html">« Prev</a><a href="832.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
