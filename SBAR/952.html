"Owen, how about we grab dinner together? I'm pretty interested in your branch, and Steven's keen on collaborating, too. It'd be a good time to talk things through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's smile faded as he picked up on her intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell she was eyeing his branch office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Steven, unsure if his friend was thinking the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George stood next to Queenie, looking like a perfect match with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his face remained expressionless, cold as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, we should have a proper discussion about the potential collaboration," Owen </span><span>said. He wasn't one to back down from trouble, but he hated being manipulated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Queenie was trying to play him, he wasn't going to let her get away with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's voice was cold and direct. "Let's go. We'll talk over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was slightly surprised. The way George spoke felt different somehow, but his aura was still the same, stoic and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Owen was confused but didn't think too much about it. He smiled and nodded. "Alright, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took a seat by the window, and Queenie had the waiter bring drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was hoping not to run into Diana. If she did, she might just lose her temper and get into a fight, but she knew she wouldn't stand a chance against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie casually glanced at Owen. "Have you seen Diana around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen shook his head and lied. "No, but I'll catch up with her later. She's cost me a lot this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie relaxed a little when she heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was a fool but a useful one. She had her eyes on several of his profitable branches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With George on her side, she was confident they'd seal the deal in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the waiter brought their dinner. The spread was extravagant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie slid some shrimp toward Owen. "I remember you love shrimp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks!" Owen smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie kept going. "Your branch in </span><span>Woodston</span><span> is doing well, huh? And I heard Steven's got some interests there, too. I also heard you're running short on funds for a few projects... He could invest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen thought for a moment. If he hadn't overheard Diana and Luna earlier, he'd have jumped at this without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, he was leaning more toward what Diana had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his face neutral, then turned to George with a smile. "Steven, you just lost your company. Are you managing alright with your finances?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George didn't flinch. "I may have lost the company, but I'm not short on funds. If you're interested, we can sign the contract today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was smooth, but there was an undeniable hunger in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brief silence followed between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen broke it with a grin. "Steven, my company's small. We're just scraping by with pocket change. You sure you want to team up with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed a shrimp and took a bite. It was tender and fresh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But oddly enough, the image of Diana eating steak popped into his mind, and he found himself thinking that the steak would probably taste better right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George didn't miss a beat. "We're friends, Owen. Honestly, we're both in need of some help right now. If you're not up for it, no worries. Friends don't pressure each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie added, almost casually, "Owen, now that Steven's lost his company, his status isn't what it used to be. If you don't want to work with him, that's fine. We won't be upset. After all, people always aim for the top. If Steven still had the Gellar Group's backing, how could we ask you for help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's words, though seemingly understanding, hit Owen's ears differently once he </span><span>saw the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her implication was clear. Now that Steven had fallen from grace, Owen was too proud to cooperate with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her final line was pure sarcasm. If Steven still had his power, he wouldn't even be bothering with someone like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Owen saw through the mask. Queenie was nothing but pretentious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grip on his fork tightened, his thoughts turning cold. He would use this branch to test both Queenie and Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Owen replied, "Queenie, what are you talking about? Steven and I have been friends since childhood. Now that he's going through a rough patch, of course, I'll help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the branch, let's finalize the deal tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be worth it to lose a branch just to understand their true intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George exchanged a look, a silent understanding passing between them. The three of them continued their meal, the conversation light and relaxed, as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, George excused himself to take a call and slipped into the lounge next door, conveniently located next to Diana's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, Yvette immediately pressed herself against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, I've missed you," she murmured, her voice low and hungry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They embraced, the air thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, George pulled back, his fingers brushing her nose with a teasing touch. "Yvette, you know I'm in love with Queenie. Don't make a scene in front of her, alright? I'll give you whatever you want, but keep it quiet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was warning Yvette not to overstep her boundaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette's eyes darkened. She came from a wealthy family, too. And she wasn't about to let Queenie look down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice turned sharp. "George, she's not loyal to you. She slept with other men, had an abortion... But I've only ever been good to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George chuckled at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the men he knew, himself included, had their fair share of affairs, but a woman who would lie like Yvette was a first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his gaze, then suddenly bit down on her lips with a hard, punishing kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette gasped in pain, pulling away to look at him, her eyes a mix of anger and longing. "George, you're cruel. My lips hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Maybe that'll remind you. I know you slept with Owen. Don't think I'm stupid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face went pale at his words. She knew he was right, but she couldn't bring herself to admit it. Her desire for him overshadowed everything. "George... That night, you were overseas. I got drunk and it just happened with Owen. But I swear I love you and only you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George wasn't fooled. He knew women like her were all talk. "Yvette, I know you love me. Here's the deal. Tonight, you and Owen leave together. Get the business secrets from his branch. If you do, I'll be with you every day next month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette froze, her eyes wide with disbelief. "George, you're asking me to sleep with another man just for some business secrets?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was pale, and she stared at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George didn't respond. Instead, he pulled her in for a kiss, and the sounds of their bodies crashing together filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the next room, Diana could hear everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, George finally left. Diana quietly opened the door, her eyes lingering on his retreating figure. She couldn't believe what she had just overheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she saw Yvette emerge, her walk </span><span>unsteady</span><span>, her face flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Luna, a knowing smile on her lips. "Luna, Steven may look strong, but his stamina? Not so great. Ten minutes in, and Yvette's already finished?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="951.html">« Prev</a><a href="953.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
