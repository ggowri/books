I've become alert. But Cecil is different. If you provoke him, your life will be difficult in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already provoked him. He made me suffer, but it was nothing. You can't beat me. Do you think Cecil can?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Cecil opposite her. Cecil's face twisted with anger. It was not the first time he had faced Queenie's malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, what you are best at is scheming against others without leaving any evidence. But there are no eternal secrets in this world," said Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie retorted, "For you, secrets are not secrets. Who would believe you if you said I framed you? Would Steven believe it? Diana, I'm always luckier than you. You will always be under my feet. No one can stop me from doing what I want to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil is standing in my way, and I will make him lose everything like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Queenie hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and shook her head, thinking, "Does she really think she is so great?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was furious. "Diana, does she usually treat you like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "I'm sorry for letting you hear this. I just want to let you know that she really wants to deal with you. You should be more careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Cecil doesn't entirely believe me. Sometimes, I have to use some tricks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my previous life, I disdained Queenie's methods. But later, I realized how pathetic it was to have a mouth that didn't explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even after I explained, no one believed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only way was to make them see the truth and realize who the real villain was."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil had to understand how terrible it is to have someone who is deliberately plotting against him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie was greedy and ungrateful. She always puts herself at the center of the world. She thinks that everyone should help her and stand by her side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled sadly. Looking at Diana's smiling face, he was a little angry. "Diana, you have helped me so much. How can I not believe you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that he believed it and smiled, "Let's go. Go back and prepare for tomorrow's auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana did not attend the auction the next day because she had to receive an infusion at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wound had been a little infected last night. Diana was not feeling well. She knew that Queenie would do everything she could to buy the land. Diana knew the result even if she didn't go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven went there. He had thought Diana would go. However, only Queenie and the others were there when Steven arrived. He was a little disappointed in not seeing Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Farley family's auction house was luxurious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who could step in here all had great wealth or high status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people had come to the auction hall. Most of them were dressed in leather shoes or fancy clothes, and their every move exuded an air of wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie liked this kind of place very much, as it could show her status and identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Steven had always taken her to various luxurious places. However, Steven was now unwilling to take her out after she forced Steven to marry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was a little nervous when she saw Steven coming. She quickly stood up and walked to Steven, begging him, "Steven, I know you want that land in the western suburbs. I want it, too. Can you give it to me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="512.html">« Prev</a><a href="514.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
