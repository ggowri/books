She stared at Luna in disbelief</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did she really just hit me?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn it, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">how come she didn&rsquo;t die there</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>D</span><span>efinitely find someone to kill her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna let out a cold laugh. "Ms. Marsh, any requests? Go ahead, name them. I'll grant them all right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She clenched her fists in delight.</span><span> </span><span>She despised Queenie&rsquo;s scheming and shamelessness the most.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's ears buzzed. A trace of blood trickled down the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lately, it was Diana that Queenie had to endure such humiliation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But today, Queenie didn&rsquo;t plan to do anything&mdash;because Dylan would get revenge for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She</span><span> had a few subordinates, all skilled fighters. She could use them to deal with Diana and her crew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you insane? You actually dared to hit Queenie!" Dylan raised his hand, ready to strike Luna.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna shot a glance at Nick and Barry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick snapped, "I'll handle him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna quickly dodged Dylan's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick aimed under his armpit and delivered a hard punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sharp pain shot through Dylan's armpit, making him let out a scream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he quickly retreated behind Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan glared at Diana, his eyes bloodshot. "Diana, your two little boy toys are quite something. Do they dare face me one-on-one?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How infuriating!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The</span><span> first attack failed. It's been a year, and Diana's only gotten stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, letting out a cold laugh. "Dylan. Your </span><span>already </span><span>failed </span><span>for once</span><span>. And you still want a one-on-one? </span><span>L</span><span>ooking to get your hand crippled?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just like Queenie, sharing the same lousy genes. Vicious and despicable, just like her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan hated Diana's smug attitude the most.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, he used that same attitude to deal with the timid version of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still remembered when he almost died from his shrimp allergy&mdash;it was </span><span>Diana</span><span> who rushed him to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since then</span><span>, Dylan improved </span><span>his impression on </span><span>Diana. At the time, he was preparing for overseas training</span><span>, b</span><span>ut while abroad, he </span><span>heard</span><span> rumors about her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When</span><span> his training ended, a snowstorm hit, grounding all flights and trains. He was stuck overseas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During that time, Jeff and Queenie filled him in everything Diana had supposedly done. He was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment flights resumed, he flew back immediately to confront her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t expect they&rsquo;d meet again so soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But because of Diana, their once happy family fell apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you're the cruel one. </span><span>You made</span><span> our family broke apart. Queenie is </span><span>my sister</span><span>. Isn't that better?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who gave you the right to mess up </span><span>my</span><span> family? You're the outsider here. If you hadn't come back, we would all be happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan couldn&rsquo;t handle the fall from grace. He used to be a respected, wealthy man, but now he was nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana still felt a pang of sadness. But she also thought she must have lost her mind to argue with a fool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, the ones who messed up your family are Queenie and Jeff. I had nothing to do with it."</span> <span>Diana</span><span> leaned back, her arms crossed, exhaling sharply as if this conversation was a waste of her time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just cut ties with your family and my four brothers. Do you think I'm an easy target, so you pin all the blame on me just to make yourself feel better?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana continued, "</span><span>Y</span><span>ou really don't get it, do you?</span><span> </span><span>Dylan, your family's downfall? That's all Queenie. She drugged your mom, tried to lock her up, and you... you sided with her. Against me.</span><span> </span><span>Against</span><span> your own mother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, shut your pathetic mouth, blind your hypocritical eyes. Then take your fake little sister and get out of my sight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face turned pale. She was furious. If she could stand, she would have slapped this idiot herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie snapped back quickly, "Diana, how can you </span><span>say such things?</span><span> If I really wanted to </span><span>hurt </span><span>my mom, </span><span>she'd already be done for, wouldn&rsquo;t she?</span><span> But she&rsquo;s fine, isn&rsquo;t she?</span><span> </span><span>She&rsquo;s perfectly fine.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She even faked debts</span><span>, </span><span>so </span><span>Jeff</span><span> got nothing when they divorced."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you pushed </span><span>her</span><span>. You&rsquo;re just bitter because I was the favorite, and you couldn&rsquo;t win over </span><span>any of </span><span>my brothers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;ve already ruined </span><span>three of them. What now&mdash;coming for Dylan too?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked righteous, her tone filled with sorrow. Tears welled up in her eyes, appear</span><span>ing</span><span> pitiful and fragile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a sharp laugh, anger laced in it. Queenie</span><span> always twisted the words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, life&rsquo;s been too quiet lately. </span><span>Thanks for reminding me what absolute nonsense sounds like. Fake sincerity? That&rsquo;s worse than anything else in this world.</span><span> </span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Whatever</span><span>, my words won&rsquo;t change anything. If </span><span>you&rsquo;re that set on destroying yourself, I&rsquo;m not stopping you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "Diana, what nonsense are you </span><span>saying</span><span>? What do</span><span>es that mean, set on destroying myself? What kind of nonsense is that?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>You know what? Good people get what they deserve. And people like you&mdash;spiteful, vicious&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get yours too.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wow! A</span><span> sharp-tongued idiot!</span><span> </span><span>How refreshing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, fine, you're the only </span><span>sweet, gentle little angel here</span><span>. </span><span>Good for you. But you know, a brain would</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ve been nice. Shame you don</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t have one. That head</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s just for show.</span><span>" Diana snapped back, unable to resist the sarcasm. Every time she saw the Marsh family, she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself until her throat was dry from all the insults.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... Diana, you're asking for it!" Dylan pointed at her furiously. "I swear, I&rsquo;m going to teach you a lesson today, you shameless woman!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He rolled up his sleeves, ready to </span><span>punch her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick moved swiftly, snapping Dylan's </span><span>accusing finger mid-air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's scream echoed through the restaurant, grabbing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone turned to look their way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan stared at his broken finger, tears streaming down his face from the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, are you okay?" Queenie snapped, furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter the place, Diana dared to make a move. The old Diana would never have. </span><span>Since when did this timid mouse grow claws? The Gellar name must be going to her head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine," Dylan said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan yelled at Nick, furious, "You bastard! </span><span>Any idea about my hand? Insured for two million! Wanna ruin my career? </span><span>You </span><span>gutter-trash gigolo think you can&mdash;</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick looked at him, a cold smirk curling on his lips. "</span><span>Funny. </span><span>For someone so precious about his hands, you've got the temperament of a rabid dog.</span><span> </span><span>J</span><span>ust gave you a little lesson."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you&rsquo;ve got so much free time, maybe find something useful to do. Didn&rsquo;t you say you trained abroad? Why are you this weak then?" Nick sneered.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1037.html">« Prev</a><a href="1039.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
