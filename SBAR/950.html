Without hesitation, he walked toward him, his frustration evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For days, Steven had been avoiding his calls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a friend, he understood that Steven was still reeling from the loss of his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The calls had gone unanswered, but Owen also understood it was because Steven didn't want to look weak in front of his friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, though, he had come to get answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, what the hell happened? How did Diana end up with your company?" Owen demanded, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George, watching from a distance, noticed how little the two men seemed to notice the difference between him and Steven. He didn't need to mimic his every gesture or expression to know how to command attention. A cold look and a controlled stance were enough to make everyone feel his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, just as you see it, I've been outplayed by Diana. Now the Gellar Group is hers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto Diana with a cold, malicious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana barely spared him a glance, unfazed by his acting. "Mr. Gellar, I'm not here to play games. You know everyone here. Let me be clear. I didn't steal the company. Your stupidity cost you everything. Don't let your two clueless friends think I took it from you. It's not that I took it. It's that you couldn't handle your mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's eyes blazed with fury. If it weren't for Queenie's foolishness, Diana wouldn't have been able to outmaneuver him so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shot Diana a glare filled with hatred. If anyone found out that Steven's affair had led to the agreement that stripped her of everything, she wouldn't be able to show her face in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and George had worked so hard for nothing, and the sting of failure cut deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe how everything had slipped through her fingers, all because of Diana's cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the one who had walked away with it all was the woman she hated most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze sharpened with anger as she watched Diana, but the latter acted like she wasn't even there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George lowered his voice, trying to keep control. "Owen, this isn't just Diana's fault. This is all because of the pre-marriage agreement. If I betrayed her, all the assets would go to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not dwell on this. If you want to talk business, we can deal with it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was stunned. He stared at Steven, still trying to make sense of it all. Everything looked the same, like his face and commanding presence, but something was missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, this doesn't feel like you. You've spent years building up the company. You've fought for this. How could you just hand it all over to Diana like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The company is in her hands now, and she's going to ruin it. That was your whole life's work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face flushed red, his muscles tense with fury. The loss of the collaboration had cost his family dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's face darkened further. "It's done. There's no point in going over it again. I'll get the company back. Just give it some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one was angrier than him. He had believed that if he eliminated Steven, he could take control of the Gellar family's wealth. But the Gellar family had played him from the start, and now all his schemes had crumbled to dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen turned and fixed a cold stare on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie leaned in, speaking quietly but urgently. "Owen, be careful. Diana's not someone you want to underestimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she could play the entire Gellar family like this, don't think she won't come after you and Yanson, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words only made Owen's anger burn hotter. His eyes narrowed with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Queenie. I won't let her get away with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie heard the resolve in his voice and knew it was only a matter of time before Diana would face the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were all victims here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched the three of them banter back and forth, a faint smile playing at the corners of her lips. She could tell that Owen and Yanson were done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking over the Gellar Group, she was already planning on tossing these two clowns aside. They'd been loyal to Queenie for far too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a woman who thrived on power and money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she didn't enjoy controlling others, she had no tolerance for anyone trampling on her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her path was clear now, and she wasn't about to let these jokers get in the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, her only regret was not living up to her grandfather's expectations of becoming a top-tier president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, she was going to make sure to fulfill his dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her grandfather always told her that a woman should stand strong and independent, live for herself, and not let love or attachments hold her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen walked up to her, towering over her. "Diana, don't get too cocky. Steven's just having a rough patch. I'll dig up your dirty secrets and ruin you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana slowly lifted her gaze, her voice icy and even. "What dirty secrets? Owen, do you even know what you're talking about? Is it me hiding something, or is it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rested one hand on the armrest of her wheelchair, chin tilted slightly as her fingers traced her jaw. Her face was cool and stunning, a picture of grace and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, but the air around her seemed to thicken with pressure so heavy it made Owen feel like he was suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was stunned. He'd never expected Diana to radiate that kind of authority, like someone who had spent years at the top of the food chain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Steven's close friend, he knew exactly how much Steven doted on Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Making this kind of scene in public would ruin Steven's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, this is your fault. You couldn't keep your man, so who's to blame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, a hint of amusement in her eyes as she turned to look at George. "Mr. Gellar's not a dog. Why would I need to tie him down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you starve a dog, it'll start acting out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George and Queenie both looked furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow and turned her sharp gaze toward Queenie. "Ms. Marsh, I didn't press charges for you stealing my design sketches last time. But don't think I'll let it slide next time. I'll make sure everyone knows what kind of thief you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face drained of color. She glanced around at the growing crowd, her composure wavering. "Diana, what exactly did I steal from you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on," Diana mocked, her voice sweet but dripping with sarcasm. "Look at you, pale as a ghost. Is it that hard to admit someone's better than you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson tried to step in, sneering. "Diana, what's so great about you? You didn't even finish high school..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hastings," Joshua cut him off, his voice sharp. "Don't listen to gossip. Your so-called prestigious university and Ms. Bishop's, there's no comparison. Don't make a fool of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson froze, clearly caught off guard. "Mr. Turner, what's that supposed to mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua turned to </span><span>Diana,</span><span> admiration clear in his eyes. "When Ms. Biship graduated from university, you were still in high school. While you were slumming it in that so-called trash university, she was already a mogul in the investment world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's what I mean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson stood there, speechless, as Luna wheeled Diana away, following Joshua out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Owen, completely confused. "What just happened? What did Joshua mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's eyes were cold as he watched Diana's retreating figure. His voice was chilling. "He's calling you an idiot."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="949.html">« Prev</a><a href="951.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
