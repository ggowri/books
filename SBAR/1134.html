Without my consent, what right do you have to be my child's father? My son will have a new dad, but it won't be you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea's voice was firm and resolute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was far too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Gale break down in tears, she felt a surge of anger. Every time she looked at Harlan, she was reminded of Gale. Harlan resembled him far too much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his father was a complete jerk, an absolute bastard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get up. You've seen the child, but let me make this clear&mdash;he's mine and has nothing to do with any of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, that night at the hotel, it was you who set me up, not the other way around. So do me a favor and stay far away from us from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale refused. It was precisely because he knew he was wrong that he wanted to make amends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he lost Althea and Harlan for good, he'd regret it for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, please, give me another chance. I know I messed up. I know you're the one who loves me most in this world. I was blind and failed to see your true heart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough!" Althea shouted, tears streaming down her face as she glared at Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was the point of saying this now? When she loved him, he ignored her completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that she no longer loved him, he suddenly started to cherish her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, you called me boring, while your unforgettable love prefers the thrill of nightlife. You crave excitement, and women like her are your perfect match."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I</span><span>'</span><span>m never going back. And you</span><span>'</span><span>ll never be this child</span><span>'</span><span>s father. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t come looking for us again. If you want to see the baby, do it from afar. But my child will never call you 'Dad.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea felt a deep ache, overwhelmed with sorrow and frustration, tears threatening to fall. She had survived the hardest times without him. She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t need him anymore, and she would never forgive him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mon... Mom... no." Harlan, despite calling his mom mean, still clung to his dad with a heart full of concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her son</span><span>'</span><span>s thoughtfulness only made Althea cry even harder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t hold it in anymore and broke into uncontrollable sobs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his mom crying, Harlan got scared and started crying along with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's leg was still healing, but he slowly stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked over, wrapped Althea and their child in his arms, and whispered softly, "Althea, I know you're hurting. Hit me if it helps, okay? We've known each other since we were kids&mdash;I know how amazing you are. But those two years... I lost my way and hurt you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, I deserve all the blame. Please, stop crying, okay? Hit me if it makes you feel better, alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea slapped Gale hard across the face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wiped her tears away and let out a cold laugh. "You're the one who told me to hit you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale felt the slap was far too light. "Althea, hit me harder."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea listened to his words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea landed several more slaps across Gale's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea's hand went numb from the slaps. She had wanted to hit him for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She truly loved him. Back then, Gale was proud but not cruel. Everything changed after he met Penelope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, you</span><span>'</span><span>ve already..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, I never touched Penelope. That night, she drugged me. I just lay beside her&mdash;I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t do anything. The child isn</span><span>'</span><span>t mine either. Diana can vouch for me. I swear, I never betrayed you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, dragged into this mess, was utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea turned to look at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze for a moment. "He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t betray you. Are you going to take him back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know how to respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What about you and Steven? Did he betray you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven quickly blurted out, "I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he said it, his face turned red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did he even bother explaining? As long as his wife knew he was innocent, that was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, they all seemed desperate to save their own skins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought people these days were so immature. She said, "Do you even know what century we're living in? Do you seriously care if your partner is a virgin?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and Althea spoke up at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All eyes turned to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea and Steven were at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shit," Diana cursed. "Are you two serious? It's the 26th century!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea smirked and asked, "If Steven and Queenie slept together, would you still want him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot back even faster, "No way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's breath hitched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea let out a sharp laugh. "Then why are you coming at me? It's the 26th century. Why do you even care?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just the thought of that possibility made her heart ache.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot Steven a sharp glare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven, however, responded with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt miserable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought to herself, "What a pointless question."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, I'll change. I'll get better and better. Just give me one more chance," Gale pleaded, grabbing Althea's hand tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea shot him a sharp glare. "I chased after you for over a decade. Now it's your turn to chase me for the next ten years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Deal!" Gale exclaimed, tears of joy streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and Paige exchanged exasperated looks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige snapped angrily, "Althea, are all the men in the world dead? Don't forgive him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea raised an eyebrow and asked, "What, you're over Frank now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige smirked. "I have a boyfriend now. He's a hundred times more handsome than Frank. Soon enough, you'll all be attending my wedding."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula glanced at Paige. Paige was a good girl, but her son just wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t lucky enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frank was still stuck in his amnesia. By the time he regained his memory, it would be too late. No one waits forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly flashed a sly smile at her. "Paige, I know who he is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige's cheeks turned crimson. "Diana, I owe you. You don</span><span>'</span><span>t mind me being Julius</span><span>'</span><span>s girlfriend, do you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly shook her head, a bright smile on her face. "Paige, not at all, not even a little. If you let Julius slip away, you'll never find a better man than him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marry Julius already and spend his money. He</span><span>'</span><span>s got more than he knows what to do with, and he gives me plenty every year."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! Once I marry him, all his money will be mine. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t even think about spending it," Paige said with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed brightly. "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t need it. My husband</span><span>'</span><span>s super rich too&mdash;I</span><span>'</span><span>ll just spend his money."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s words, Steven instantly puffed up with pride.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her call him "husband," he felt utterly satisfied and smug.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked over to Diana and took her hand in his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marie watched her daughter and shook her head slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since she was ten, her daughter had been chasing after Gale. Was she destined to never escape him in this lifetime?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spoke softly, "Paula, sit down. Let's talk."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1133.html">« Prev</a><a href="1135.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
