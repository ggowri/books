He had an impressive height and a charming demeanor, with striking features and warm, inviting eyes. He was the quintessential sunny boy, and his smile was uplifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!" Laughter erupted around them, accompanied by playful whistles.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the music began, the boy grinned and asked, "Is this song okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, it's perfect!" Diana replied, excitement bubbling within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the music played, Diana unleashed an incredible burst of energy. She pushed off the ground, soaring into the air and executing a beautiful spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon landing, she quickly crouched down, using one hand to support herself while her legs swept across the floor like a whirlwind, tearing through the air around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy mirrored her movements, their coordination seamless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing each other, they began to sway their shoulders rapidly, embodying the rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's head bobbed in sync with the beat, her hair flowing freely in the breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the boy slid forward, leaning down to touch the ground. His legs traced a graceful arc in the air before he landed smoothly, reaching out to grab Diana's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they launched into a dazzling series of floor moves, their hands moving swiftly, bodies gliding like serpents.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sprang up, the boy twisted his waist with precision, each turn perfectly timed to the music.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana matched his energy, her feet dancing in a rapid exchange. Their eyes met, and an unspoken understanding passed between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an intense series of moves, they executed a challenging aerial turn, leaving the audience in awe and prompting cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused, looking at the boy with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, you dance amazingly well!" he said, beaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks! You're great too," Diana replied. "Can I have your contact info?" the boy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she hesitated, a familiar figure stepped in front of her. "Sorry, but my wife doesn't exchange contact information with strangers."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to see Steven, who was radiating an air of authority that commanded respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy looked surprised at Diana's youthful and radiant appearance. "How can she be married? She looks so young!" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, dude, you're being a bit controlling here. We clicked. It's just a dance partner thing. What's wrong with exchanging numbers? Are you going to keep your wife from meeting other guys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calling Steven "dude" darkened his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy, seemingly around eighteen, stood in stark contrast to Steven's mature demeanor, making Steven feel a bit out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy raised his eyebrows and looked at Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to exchange numbers with him?" Steven asked Diana, turning to her with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was confused. "I just wanted to dance! We were having a normal conversation. It's not what you think. If we exchange numbers, we can dance again next time. We have great chemistry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized she hadn't even noticed Steven lurking nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't see him here just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face hardened. Her mention of their chemistry only fueled his anger. In a low voice, he said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took her hand and started to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy watched them leave, a hint of regret in his eyes. "What a shame! She's such a talented dancer. If she joined our team, we'd definitely win the competition at the end of the year."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, it's no big deal. With your skills, you could easily find out who she is. That girl had a great figure and danced beautifully. She's genuinely talented. She's married, and we wouldn't do anything inappropriate. But that guy looked at us like we were criminals."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="781.html">« Prev</a><a href="783.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
