Penelope had cheated on him, and he was going to raise a child for another man.</span><span> </span><span>Of course</span><span>,</span><span> Diana wouldn't tell Gale any of this because he wouldn't believe her at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her previous life, she was humiliated by them one by one after Diana told Gale, so of course she wouldn't care about them in this life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's great. I was afraid that you would degrade me by becoming my family. After all, you're a village girl who didn't even graduate from high school."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope wouldn't let Diana be her family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Penelope were best friends. The two were like-minded and despised Diana equally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, I know how you feel about being kicked out, but there's no shortage of compassion in this society. Diana, you've got nothing, and you're pathetic."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..." Nolan smiled, "Diana, where is this idiot from? Why does she think you have nothing? Look at her being poor and pedantic, and how dare she say that about you? What she's wearing is less than a hundred thousand dollars, and what you're wearing is worth a million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Nolan suddenly looked apologetic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I shouldn't degrade you by comparing you to someone like her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head with a smile. "It's okay, because some people just like to prove themselves by bragging in front of others."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope felt furious, and being teased by a man as handsome as Nolan made her truly irritated and embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nolan seemed to be dressed in an unusual way, and he was supposed to be rich.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you so good at lying? Could what she's wearing be worth a million dollars?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, why are you so shameless? How could you be so pretentious?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that the time was approaching, Diana didn't want to talk nonsense with Penelope. "Penelope, you should take the right path. Don't be too arrogant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked over at Nolan. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the two left, Queenie sent Steven the photo she just took.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie: [Steven, look, I met Diana, and she came to dinner with this guy again. Diana won't refuse any guy for money, and she's such a skittish woman.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was working in his office. He looked grim when he received Queenie's picture and message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew the restaurant, and he went to the restaurant with Evan after shutting down his computer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had warned Diana, but she was challenging his bottom line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie knew Steven would be there, so she and Penelope stood at the door waiting for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Penelope and Queenie had known each other since childhood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were also unspoken secrets between the two.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the time she waited for Steven to come over, Queenie learned the number of the private room Diana was in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, Steven didn't disappoint Queenie, and he arrived at the hotel in twenty minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven entered with a tall build.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed angry and looked extremely indifferent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no expression on his handsome face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie pretended to be worried as she walked over, "Steven, you're here. I was so worried about Diana that I sent you a message, and I found out that she was in room 302."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="83.html">« Prev</a><a href="85.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
