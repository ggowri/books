"Alright, enough with the sweet talk. Keep going like this and I'll pass out again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, let's head home and get some sleep then." Steven quickly unbuckled his seatbelt, his voice tender. He walked around to her side, opened the door, and helped her out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan and Luna were waiting by the entrance. Seeing them return, they rushed over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sis, Steven, you're back!" Luna called out cheerfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Luna with a warning look. "Luna, you're pregnant now. Stop being so reckless - you need to take it easy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna didn't feel pregnant at all. "Sis, I don't have any morning sickness or fatigue. I just crave spicy and sour stuff. I feel completely normal every day, eating like a horse."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked envious. "Luna, I'm so jealous. My morning sickness is brutal right now, and I'm exhausted all the time. I can't stand anything sour or spicy - nothing sounds good. All I want to do is sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What can we do?" Luna looked worried. Not eating during pregnancy couldn't be good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Let's go inside first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan wrapped his arm around Luna, cautioning her, "Luna, even if you don't have symptoms, you still need to be careful. No more running around like that. Watching you sprint makes my heart stop."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan panicked every time he saw her run. At his age, having a child felt like a miracle - he literally woke up grinning. Seeing Luna next to him when he opened his eyes filled him with pure joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours later, all the equipment Steven had arranged was set up, and the room had been completely sterilized. Once everything was ready, Dr. Davidson from obstetrics approached Steven. "Mr. Gellar, we're all set. Your wife can come in for the exam now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana, who was resting on the couch with her eyes closed. "Diana, I'll carry you over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana made a soft sound of agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want to walk - she had zero energy. Luna was practically bouncing around despite being pregnant, while Diana said, "Steven, why am I so fragile? It's just pregnancy, but I feel like I'm dying. I can barely move."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven scooped her up, noticing how much weight she'd lost since getting pregnant. His eyes clouded with worry. "Diana, the doctor said it'll get better after the first trimester. Don't worry - I'll be right here with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once in the room, Steven placed her gently on the bed. Diana pointed toward the door. "Steven, go wait outside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked down at her. "Diana, I want to see our baby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt her face burn. "No, go out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't want him there for the examination she was about to have.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Davidson walked in and said, "Feeling shy, Mrs. Gellar? You're married now, and if Mr. Gellar wants to see the baby, just let him stay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pointed at the curtain. "Then pull that closed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled helplessly. He'd kissed and explored every inch of her body, yet she was still so bashful. Understanding her embarrassment, Steven told Dr. Davidson, "Dr. Davidson, my Diana gets shy. Please pull the curtain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that moment, Steven felt happiness bubbling up from deep in his chest. Being able to say "this is my wife" in front of everyone made him feel incredibly proud and elated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Davidson drew the curtain and began Diana's ultrasound. Diana knew the drill and had already adjusted her clothing. Dr. Davidson applied the probe and then turned up the volume so they could hear the baby's heartbeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, Dr. Davidson looked at Steven. "Mr. Gellar, you two hit the jackpot - it's twins! Look, right here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's dark eyes lit up with joy, as if stars were dancing in them, and his whole face glowed with happiness. "Dr. Davidson, what's that sound?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Davidson smiled and explained, "Mr. Gellar, this is your baby's heartbeat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's emotions were all over the place right now, his eyes filled with anticipation and excitement. This was his child's heartbeat - so strong. This was incredible. Finally, Steven would have a complete family of his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked, "Is it safe for my wife to fly long distances right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Davidson replied, "Absolutely. Your wife is in excellent health. Fatigue and drowsiness during pregnancy are completely normal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Davidson knew they traveled by private jet, so it wouldn't be too taxing. That put Steven's mind at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Davidson turned to Diana. "Ma'am, you can sit up now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over to help her as Diana was putting her pants back on. Seeing this, Steven finally understood why she'd asked him to step out earlier. He chuckled helplessly. "So you didn't want me to see you taking off the other pant leg."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face flushed red. "Mm-hmm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lifted her down from the examination table. "You're such a tease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked toward the doorway. "Luna, come in for your checkup too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna appeared in the doorway and smiled when she saw Diana. "Sis, I just went to the hospital earlier. I don't need another exam."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh." Diana turned to Dr. Davidson. "Doctor, I'm sorry for troubling you to come out so late."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Davidson smiled back. Even though it was a late-night house call, Steven's compensation was generous. "You're too kind, ma'am. This is what I do. If everything's fine with you, I'll take my leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Dr. Davidson, I'm entrusting you with all of my wife's prenatal care."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Davidson was pleased. "Of course, Mr. Gellar."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the doctor left, Diana and Steven went upstairs to rest. They had dinner upstairs together. Steven packed the essentials - the Bishop family would provide everything else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, do you think these clothes will be enough?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at the suitcase by his feet. "That's plenty. Grandpa said Dad already prepared lots of things for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over and sat beside her. "Diana, we're having our wedding in two months - you won't be showing yet. You don't need to worry about anything. Just show up and be my bride."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's beautiful eyes sparkled with unmistakable happiness. "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early the next morning, Diana's family and the Young family - over a dozen people in total - boarded a private jet bound for the Bishop estate. After a three-hour flight, they landed at Francis City's private airfield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once they touched down, Steven was stunned. What greeted his eyes was Francis City's castle. In that moment, Steven finally understood Diana's true identity - she was Francis City's little princess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gripped Diana's hand tighter. Sensing his unease, Diana asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Diana, you're completely out of my league."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him confused. "What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven walked over and respectfully said, "Mr. Bishop."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop looked at Steven, his expression turning serious. "You're Steven?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop studied him for a long moment. "You've been taking care of my daughter all this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have, and I always will."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good." Copper Bishop nodded approvingly. "Diana chose well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Dad, I don't blame you at all. I know you had your reasons."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could feel it&mdash;Dad loved her deeply. Even though they'd been apart, that love had never wavered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop's eyes filled with tears as he held his daughter close. "Diana, you're so understanding. Dad promises, from now on, no one will ever hurt you again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana beamed, linking arms with both her father and Steven. "Dad, Steven's amazing. He's been so good to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold chuckled from nearby. "Alright, enough standing around out here. Let's go inside. Diana needs to see her real home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they walked toward the castle, Diana marveled at everything around her. The gardens were immaculate, the fountains sparkling in the sunlight. Staff members lined the pathway, all bowing respectfully as she passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Welcome home, Miss Diana," they said in unison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt like she was living in a fairy tale. This was really her life now?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the castle, the grandeur was even more breathtaking. Crystal chandeliers hung from soaring ceilings, marble floors gleamed under the light, and priceless artwork adorned the walls.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana," Copper Bishop said softly, "this is where you belong. This is your heritage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to him, her eyes bright with unshed tears. "Dad, it's beautiful. But honestly? The most beautiful part is having you and Grandpa here with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop pulled her into another embrace. "My sweet girl. We have so much time to make up for."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1177.html">« Prev</a><a href="1179.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
