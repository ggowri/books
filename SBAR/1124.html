"Yanson, Owen warned you, but you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t listen. You</span><span>'</span><span>ve always been stubborn, refusing to take advice from others."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t adults face the consequences of their own actions?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had tried to advise Yanson, but he refused to listen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had no intention of helping someone who ignored well-meaning advice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson looked at her, hesitating to speak, regret written all over his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What was I thinking back then? Why didn</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">t I trust Diana and Owen?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Owen clearly warned me that Queenie might target my company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe it. He thought Queenie would never hurt him&mdash;after all, he had helped her so many times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this morning, his company</span><span>'</span><span>s secrets were leaked, causing massive losses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood silently nearby, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stood frozen in the hallway, the tension thick and suffocating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Yanson looked at Steven and Diana with hopeful eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly spoke, "Diana, maybe we can use this incident to uncover Queenie's hidden forces."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought of Sandra, then Leopold's offer to take her back to see her father.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Yanson and changed her mind. He was at fault, but she could benefit from this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's expression darkened. "Let's go," she said coldly. "We're checking out your company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson stared at Diana in shock, then relief washed over him. She was willing to help.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a cold glance, cutting him off. "I'm not helping you," she said flatly. "I'm helping myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson looked down, his voice tinged with disappointment. "I'm sorry, Diana. But thank you anyway. I'll take you to my company right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven called Evan, telling him to bring the car over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them got in the car and headed straight to Yanson's company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson led them to his office, pointing at the computer. "Steven, my company's computers went black this morning and still aren't fixed. The bank called, saying a payment was deposited into my account earlier, but it's not showing up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The bank investigated and found that the money had been transferred overseas."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One of my long-term overseas projects had its base price leaked, and the deal was stolen. I'm on the verge of bankruptcy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew his way around computers but wasn't an expert. One glance, and he could tell this was a newly developed virus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood by for a few minutes, then sat at the computer, her fingers flying across the keyboard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson watched in shock as the woman he once dismissed as a nobody turned out to be a computer whiz.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that moment, Yanson learned a hard lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman he looked down on, Diana, was his savior, while the Queenie he had flattered was the real devil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, Diana stopped typing and called Joseph.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph's voice was filled with excitement. "Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled. "Joseph, remember the USB drive I gave you? There's a link starting with 'F' on it. Send it to my phone&mdash;I need it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph replied, "Got it. I'll send it to you right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana ended the call and asked Yanson for a new USB drive. Once she received the link from Joseph, she loaded it onto the drive, plugged it into her computer, and entered another set of data.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minutes later, the screen filled with blue text, strange symbols flickering across. Even Steven couldn't make sense of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana remained calm, her eyes fixed on the screen as she occasionally typed swiftly on the keyboard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Yanson no longer dared to underestimate Diana&mdash;she truly had skills!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt like a complete fool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Diana lacked the ability, Steven would never entrust her with his life's work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson realized he shouldn't have been prejudiced against Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten minutes later, Diana turned to Yanson and said, "I've located the hacker targeting your company. Send someone there immediately, but make sure not to alert them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson was about to agree when Diana stood up and said, "Forget it. I don't trust you to handle this. I'll go myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson froze, overwhelmed with shame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had consulted every computer engineer in the company, and they all said it was impossible to solve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Diana had solved the problem in just a matter of minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson asked, "Diana, I want to help. What can I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and said, "Just call the cops."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson felt even more ashamed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven told Yanson to come along with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way, Yanson called the police.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sent the directions to Evan in advance, and he drove fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After cracking the password, Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t alert the hacker. Instead, she wanted to find out who they were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her past life, Queenie used Joseph to develop a game project and made a fortune.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, Joseph's skills were applied to the more impactful field of medicine. He excelled greatly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana checked the time. They had ten minutes left to arrive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her anxious, Steven took her hand and reassured her softly, "Diana, don</span><span>'</span><span>t worry. They won</span><span>'</span><span>t get away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and said, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m wondering, after Queenie lost Joseph, who did she turn to? We haven</span><span>'</span><span>t figured that out yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie had hidden herself well. Diana had been too busy to dig into it before. But now that Leopold was back and Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s issues were resolved, she finally had time to handle it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson listened to Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s words and suddenly realized he knew nothing about Queenie&mdash;and even less about Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven," Yanson said, sitting in the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked casually, "What is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yanson muttered, "I had no idea Queenie was hiding so much. She always played the innocent victim in front of us. Am I really that blind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He deeply regretted ever trusting Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at his guilty expression and said coolly, "Isn't she exactly your type? Getting played by her&mdash;do you feel wronged?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1123.html">« Prev</a><a href="1125.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
