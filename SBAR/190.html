It was late autumn, and the sunlight was blinding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a long pause, he spoke calmly, "Send the money back. She's my wife; it's my duty to pay her hospital bills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, take my card to Diana. She can use it however she wants."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could only follow orders. "Understood, Mr. Gellar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan stopped the car at the red light and returned the money to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew Diana wouldn't accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was having a meal when she saw the refunded money and the message from Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Ms. Bishop, Mr. Gellar said you are his wife, and it's his duty to pay your hospital bills.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana immediately called Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello, Ms. Bishop," Evan said, putting the call on speaker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's tone was cold. "Evan, tell your boss we're in a divorce. I won't use a penny of his money. He once told me I wasn't entitled to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I won't use his money in the future either. I've sent it back, don't you return it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you have the time, persuade Steven to finalize the divorce sooner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana finished speaking and hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She immediately sent the money back again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan smiled helplessly. "Mr. Gellar, you heard it yourself. Ms. Bishop won't use your money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was to be completely honest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everything Steven did for Queenie was like supporting a mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was puzzled and frowned. "What I said before was just out of anger..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But, Mr. Gellar, even if you were just angry, everything you've done for Queenie looks 100% supporting a mistress. Even the Marsh family knows you favor her.The Marsh family dotes on Queenie and has also accepted your favoritism.You never denied it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You've been giving Queenie millions of dollars in pocket money each month while ignoring your wife. To us, you're the epitome of a cheating husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, you shouldn't delay Ms. Bishop's future anymore. You should finalize the divorce..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Evan," Steven said angrily, glaring at him."I told you, those were just angry words. Diana was malicious before..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, I don't want to argue with you. You all see Queenie through rose-colored glasses, thinking she can do no wrong. Everyone criticized Ms. Bishop, so you assumed she was at fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But as outsiders, we can see that your actions are all about favoritism, while you think it's deep love, gratitude, or affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"True gratitude is being there for you without complaints like Ms. Bishop did. From childhood until now, Queenie has only taken from you, never giving anything in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie is your untouchable treasure, needing no effort, only your love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But to outsiders like us, and to Ms. Bishop, what you've done is terrifying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan finished in one breath, feeling relieved. He saw the green light ahead and immediately drove forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven sneered. "You listened to her and came here trying to persuade me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wasn't going to divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He admitted he hadn't seen Queenie's true nature before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it weren't for the photos and videos Diana showed him, he wouldn't have believed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie probably didn't realize that all her actions were flawless until this one incident exposed her secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan chuckled. "Mr. Gellar, I also think Ms. Bishop is quite pitiful. You knew she had no source of income while taking care of you, yet you didn't let her use your money. You've used her perfectly as a pawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana wasn't some country girl; she was a successful lady who only began to shine after leaving you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why won&rsquo;t you let go, Mr. Gellar?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="189.html">« Prev</a><a href="191.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
