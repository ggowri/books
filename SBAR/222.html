"Queenie, are you threatening me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled sweetly and winked at him. "Steven, how dare I threaten you. We are a perfect match."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was really cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in Steven's eyes, she was pretentious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His favorable impression of her was shattered. He could see through her stupid trick at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, ever since your return, you have been looking for opportunities to frame Diana and sow discords between her and me, right?" Steven asked calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was so angry at his words that she laughed. She reminded him seriously, "Steven, I don't understand what you are talking about. You always want to divorce Diana because you are not firm enough, and you love me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you blame me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All men desired to have a wife and a lover!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Steven had always been steadfast, how could he not have believed in Diana but in her alone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the Marsh family had loved Diana enough, how could they have bullied Diana with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, their affection for her was not that intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven narrowed his deep eyes and leaned back on the chair casually. "You're right. I am not firm enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie beamed with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Steven's words were ambiguous, she thought that he had finally realized that he always loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I knew you could figure it out. We grew up together. I stayed by your side when you were in the most difficult times." Queenie reminded him all the time that she was his savior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven pondered and discovered that it was Diana who stayed by his side when he was in the most difficult time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are amazing. Go back now. I have to return to the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His tone was indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie pointed to the pumpkin soup she had brought. "Steven, I brought the pumpkin soup for you. Eat some."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven gazed at the soup. Its color was very terrible. He said with disgust, "No. The smell suggests that the taste is not what I want.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, if you want to marry me, be as sincere as Diana. The pumpkin soup was cooked by the servants. Have you ever been sincere?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven left after he finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie glared at his back. In the past, whenever she said something was delicious, even if it was not, he would still say it was delicious to save her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he compared her with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could Diana, a country bumpkin, be compared with an elegant lady like her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was overshadowed by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had been gone for five months, but Steven was still unwilling to divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did he really believe Diana's story?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did he still remember how good she had been to him, so he couldn't adapt to life without her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she had taken good care of him in the past two years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana depended on him, and he couldn't live without her consideration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, he felt uncomfortable and refused to divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it didn't matter. Queenie was determined to help him adapt to her kindness quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She must capture his heart. She would let Diana know that she had easy access to things that Diana would never dare to dream of.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, she would snatch away whatever Diana liked and cared about.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="221.html">« Prev</a><a href="223.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
