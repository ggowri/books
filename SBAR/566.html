Before the police chief's wife moved in, that room was assigned to my friend. The wind was howling so fiercely that we decided to switch to a different room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never imagined the criminals would target a child and blackmail my friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's expression shifted as everything clicked into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright. This hospital has been plagued by child abductions and ransom demands for the past two years. With the island surrounded by water, it's easy for them to slip away. Now that they've taken my son, I can finally catch them all. Thank you for sharing this information. Just focus on taking care of your child; I'll let the police handle the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a relieved breath, thanking him before heading upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned away, a menacing glint flickered in her eyes. "Penelope, you've just sealed your own fate. That police chief looks like he means business; he'll definitely flush you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced back at the ward door, thinking, "There must still be some of Penelope's crew lurking around here, but the police will get to the bottom of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can finally relax and get some sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix watched Diana's retreating figure and instructed one of his officers, "Keep an eye on her. Verify what she said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer saluted and promptly left to follow orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana entered the hospital, she noticed an officer trailing behind her. A smile crept onto her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "They don't believe my story, but that's fine. I'm telling the truth. Penelope can't escape this island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in her room, Althea and the baby were sound asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gently placed the baby on the bed beside Althea before closing her eyes, finally ready to drift off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Penelope had polished off a bottle of beer when there was a knock at her door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking it was Rachel returning, she flung the door open. "Aunt Rachel, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were cut short by the sight of two unfamiliar men standing outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of dread washed over Penelope. "Who are you? What do you want at this hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix and his team swiftly entered, slamming the door shut behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix pulled out his gun, aiming it directly at Penelope's head, his eyes icy. "Where's my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope froze, confusion etched on her face. "What... what son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap! You took my son and are demanding 10 million in ransom. If you don't start talking, I'll blow your brains out. If my son dies, you'll go straight to hell with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope mused, "Wait, Althea's baby is his? Not Gale's? I'm in deep trouble now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't understand what you're talking about!" Penelope stammered, desperation creeping into her voice as she clung to her denial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Then you can join my son in the afterlife. Dr. Max will follow you too," Felix growled, his anger boiling over. He had dealt with enough deceitful people in his line of work to know how to handle someone like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept the gun trained on Penelope's forehead. "Time to face the music!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope, trembling in fear, suddenly collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, no! This isn't how it looks! If I had your kid, why would I still be here? I would've run for the hills!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Felix's gaze flickered to her vibrating phone on the table.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="565.html">« Prev</a><a href="567.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
