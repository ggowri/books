Just trust me on this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, you're free</span><span> not</span><span> to </span><span>believe </span><span>me if you want."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not that it would change anything if he didn't believe her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd done what she could and said what needed to be said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a year, the Farley family would definitely run into trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they were prepared, they wouldn't be able to stop those people. They were everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, she had no intention of getting too close to the Farley family. In their world, only profit could make them bow their heads and show respect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the party, she'd impressed them with her bold moves, setting that broken arm and giving Rita that effective medicine. That's why they were being so polite to her now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she were just an ordinary person, like </span><span>she was in her </span><span>past life, Cecil would have treated her worse than an animal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They have ways of infiltrating everywhere. You'd better watch your backs."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All she could remember was that Cecil had died a horrible death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Cecil, you might not believe this, but I had a dream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It said y</span><span>ou died a gruesome death. Your limbs were torn off, and your body was fed to the dogs."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Cecil laughed in disbelief. He found it absurdly funny that she was spouting off about some dream, telling him he'd die such a terrible death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, now you're just being ridiculous. I have no plans to die anytime soon. I'm in the prime of my life!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I want to stick around for a while longer, spend more time with my grandmother."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a twinge in her heart as she thought about the horrific state of his body after death, even though she'd only witnessed it as a disembodied soul.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rita's face, however, grew wary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because some things were happening a few days ago</span><span>. T</span><span>heir company's project ran into trouble. By the time she found out, someone had suddenly quit and disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to track the person down, but upon investigation, she discovered all the materials were fake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cecil, about this upcoming car race..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma, I have to go to this race. Diana just had a dream, and dreams usually mean the opposite anyway." Cecil didn't want to give up the race for this reason.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rita furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rita doted on Cecil so much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her past life, Cecil's death had driven Rita to an early grave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was sharper than anyone </span><span>had thought</span><span>. She'd noticed something off about Queenie but </span><span>thought</span><span> it </span><span>was some</span><span> </span><span>young people</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s joke</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until Queenie seized control of the Farley Group that Rita realized her suspicions had been spot-on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The absolute bloodbath between </span><span>Capitole's</span><span> elite families kicked off a year later.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would be her golden opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This year, everyone was lying low like snakes in winter, reluctant to stick their necks out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in </span><span>one</span><span> year, when the Farley family's troubles erupted, all the hidden powers would </span><span>jump into</span><span> the scene in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was careful not to show </span><span>off</span><span> too much. In these old money circles, nobody was as simple as they seemed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just played her part, helping others when it suited her, always leaving herself a</span><span> way </span><span>out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Living through this a second time, she could only see the broad strokes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caution was her new watchword.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn't meddle in others' happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd focus on securing her slice of joy!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tonight's dinner was delightful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the meal, Cecil offered to take Rita home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, meanwhile, waited by the roadside for Luna.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But instead, two familiar bodyguards showed up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana eyed them warily, her brow furrowing slightly. Their presence meant Steven was nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, a fancy car pulled up moments later.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes flashed with anger when she saw it was indeed Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mrs. Gellar, Mr. Gellar wants you to get in. He says you've been gone for four months now, and it's time to come home."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="73.html">« Prev</a><a href="75.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
