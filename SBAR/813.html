Our business is thriving and stable. In fact, we even bought a villa this year, just waiting for you to come over for a vacation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's heart swelled with joy at the thought of visiting her family after Christmas. She had a project to discuss there, so the timing was perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tobias, I won't immigrate," she said firmly. "I love my country. I can stay abroad for a few years, but I have no plans to leave permanently. Listen, Alexander will have a bright future. You must collaborate with him more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias chuckled. "I know. You've reminded me, and I'll follow your advice. But Julius and I will rush back before your birthday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, tears welled up in Diana's eyes. "Hubery still won't forgive me? Back then, I made a hasty decision to marry Steven, and Hubery has been heartbroken ever since. Is he never willing to forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias comforted her. "Diana, don't think that way. Hubery is just stubborn. In truth, he deeply wants to see you. Every time you send us a message, he watches from the side, secretly happy. But he can't bring himself to talk to you. After all, he was furious when you suddenly decided to marry Steven. Hubery has a keen eye and knows Steven wouldn't treat you well. He was right. Seeing you live a depressed life, he couldn't bear it, so he went abroad. But even there, he's always kept an eye on you. He loves you very much; don't overthink it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's heart ached even more. "Tobias, I know. I love you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to smile through her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias blurted out with affection, "Diana, I love you, too. You must take care of yourself and let Nolan handle things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will. Don't worry about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few more words, Diana ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she looked out at the bright lights outside, she knew Steven had returned. She stood up and headed to the kitchen to finish preparing dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping Steven stable and ensuring Tobias' success was her priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let anger get the better of you." She reminded herself. "Remember, harmony brings wealth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a sense of calm wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Good deeds would bring good fortune, and helping others ultimately helped oneself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A broader mind would lead to greater wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Win hearts first, then make money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, Steven hadn't caused her irreversible harm as he had in her previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain she had endured was common among many women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hurt between love and hate, though painful, was not fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As humans, they should have a broader vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recalled Leopold's words often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You four siblings must remember, sometimes yielding brings peace, while fighting brings misfortune. Leave a way for others and a way to make money for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt his wisdom was spot on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spread your wings and let your mind soar!" she mumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stepped out of the car as the floor lights of the villa cast a warm glow. A sense of warmth filled his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan handed him a bouquet of roses. "Mr. Gellar, these are the roses you bought for Mrs. Gellar. It's the first time you've given her roses. I've checked, and she loves them the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at him. "Who did you ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was confident. "Madam Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded, trusting his grandmother's insight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had often seen Diana buying roses and placing them in the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," he said, his eyes lighting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked in with roses in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He changed his shoes and headed towards the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana brought out some spicy tacos, the aroma filling the dining room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She set the dishes down on the table, only to find herself stepping into a scene where a banquet of roses sprawled like a red sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Steven instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven caught the glimmer of surprise in her eyes, confirming that his gesture had struck the right chord. With a gentle smile, he whispered, "For you!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="812.html">« Prev</a><a href="814.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
