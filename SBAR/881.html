"Yes, it was him who forced me. I asked him to take responsibility, but he refused. He even forced me to get rid of the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The baby was an accident. The one I love is George, and that has never changed. If it had, how could George have taken so many partnerships from Steven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "Andrew, you've seen everything I've done over the years. I've worked so hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But after being with Steven, he only gave me financial support. He sends me so much money every month, just as a thank-you for saving his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell he treats me well, but I know he's never loved me. He doesn't love anyone. Steven grew up in the environment you raised him in; he doesn't even understand what love is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Andrew, pretending in front of him has been so tiring. When will you finally act?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, he's already suspicious about the car accident and the fire from back then. Our previous plans won't work anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand why Andrew was so determined to kill Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven was little, Andrew deliberately tormented him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Steven grew older, he faced countless schemes and traps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Steven took over the Gellar Group that Andrew's methods softened. He allowed Queenie to keep a hold on Steven's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ever since her birthday party, when Diana fainted and woke up, things had started to spiral out of her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, she had felt so exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted someone to lean on, but in the end, she realized that Steven was her best support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew narrowed his eyes and said nothing. Those events, which Andrew always thought were accidents, were now under suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his plans had been ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You can't control Steven anymore. It's time for George to come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was excited at the news. Steven hadn't allowed George to come back all these years. "He can finally return? Andrew, can you really get him back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need him for my current business. If he works with me, even without Steven, we can achieve great things," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "As long as George returns, we can use Steven's reputation to secure many partnerships."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exactly Andrew's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He warned her, "Queenie, I won't tell George about your pregnancy. This is your last chance. If you can't seize it, don't blame George for being ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep Steven steady. As long as he cares about the debt of saving his life, it'll benefit us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie nodded. "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, she knew Steven wouldn't help her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Evan, Steven had even thrown her into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt delighted that George was coming back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Steven woke up early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his eyes and saw Diana still sleeping. He smiled gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't moved since last night. She was such a deep sleeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven got up slowly. He had slept well and was in a great mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up his phone and took a picture of her sleeping face, saving it in his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the photo, he smiled, "Diana, you're cuter when you're asleep than when you're awake. I know you misunderstand me now, but one day, the truth will come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He left the room quietly, glancing back at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled over and continued to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her for a while and headed to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he came out, he received a call from his bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?" he answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, last night Andrew went to see Queenie. However, there wasn't any concealed spot near the hospital room door, so if we approached, we would've been discovered. We couldn't hear what they talked about," reported the bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew the two were collaborating, but he hadn't expected Andrew to act so impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already gone to warn Queenie last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "It's fine. Keep watching Andrew. He's likely to make a move in the coming days. Monitor his every action closely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Gellar," replied the bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven put down the phone. By the end of the Christmas festivities, he would have the answers he sought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he discovered the identity of that person, he wouldn't hold back anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He headed to the bathroom to dry his hair and then instructed someone to prepare a gift for his visit to see Helen today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early in the morning, Diana was woken up by a call from Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staying awake all night, it would take her two days to recover the lost sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still half-asleep, she reached for her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she opened her eyes just enough to swipe the answer button. "Grandma?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, did I call too early? Did I wake you?" Helen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat up straight and smiled, "Grandma, not at all! I just woke up. How have you been recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen replied, "Good. Christmas is almost here, isn't it? Yesterday, I spoke with Steven. I asked the two of you to come home and have lunch with me. I've already instructed the chef to prepare your favorite dishes. If you're still sleepy, go back to sleep for a little while. There's no rush to come over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana remembered what Steven had told her last night. They would be visiting Helen today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Grandma, it's fine. I'll freshen up and head over right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen replied, "Good. As for Zora, I'll find an excuse to kick her out today. Such a person cannot stay for Christmas. I've discussed it with your grandpa, and he agrees there's no need to keep her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned. "Alright, Grandma, whatever you decide is fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. I've already gathered the evidence. I'll call the police to come over shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Grandma. Please be careful. We'll head over soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was worried that Zora might be too cunning and that Helen could be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her drowsiness vanished instantly. She quickly got out of bed and went to the bathroom to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Gellar Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the call, Helen put down her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up and went downstairs for breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora, who had come upstairs to wake her, overheard the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She heard Helen's footsteps and hurriedly left the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen had found out. It was not good news for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't let Helen call the police to arrest her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't let her son grow up with a mother in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora went straight to the garden and called Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had woken up. After having breakfast, she was preparing for her IV treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Zora's call, she hesitated briefly. Her pregnancy had already delayed her plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?" she answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora's panicked voice came through. "Ms. Marsh, bad news. Helen has found me out!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="880.html">« Prev</a><a href="882.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
