Her touch was real, and so was her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea stepped back, smiling at Diana. Diana had lost a lot of weight, but Althea was happy because she no longer saw the sadness in Diana's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gaze was as bright as when Althea had first met her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I knew you'd have an awakening someday, just like I did, and you'd stop letting them bully you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes reddened. For Althea, it was cutting her losses in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for Diana, it took dying once to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Althea. I've already left the Marsh Villa, and I'm divorcing Steven. I'll never return to the Marsh Villa, and I'll never love Steven again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She came here suddenly because Alexander had an urgent matter and couldn't make it back. With no meeting tonight, she decided to visit Althea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was pleased, seeing Diana truly let go of the Marsh family. "Diana, it's good that you've left. You're talented and shouldn't be worn down by them. A man must be worth everything you give up for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at the peaceful ocean under the sunset. "Look at me. I liked Gale since I was 12.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I chased after him in middle school and became the biggest joke. I did all kinds of foolish things for him, only to realize later that he never loved me, no matter what I did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The setup a few months ago made me completely give up on him. You asked me why I left so decisively if I loved him so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Back then, I wanted to tell you this. Seeing your devotion to Steven reminded me of how I was with Gale. Women like us, who lack self-love and are insecure, won't find happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After that night, my overwhelming love for Gale faded away. I no longer love him and won't cling to him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I chased him for over ten years, and everyone laughed at me, calling me desperate. But I was just pursuing my happiness. I laughed off the gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He often went to see Penelope. I never thought a woman like her deserved his love, and I believed he'd return one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But childhood sweethearts can't compete with destiny. His heart was always with Penelope."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The setting sun reflected in Althea's beautiful eyes, showing both relief and letting go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana understood now. She, too, faced the ocean, her voice tinged with a smile. "Thank you, Althea! I finally realized that letting go isn't that hard. The ones who make things difficult are ourselves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea, seeing that Diana finally understood, smiled knowingly. Looking down at her round belly, she said, "I know you're busy, but you must keep this secret. The baby will be born soon. The island has a hospital, and the baby will be born here. But I don't want the Marsh family to know I'm pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale doesn't like me and probably won't love this child either. It's better if he doesn't know about him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was carrying a son. The doctor who did the checkup was her classmate and didn't hide it from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana understood her pain. "Althea, I don't plan to let Gale know either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't informed Gale about the incident either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was her wish, but she knew it wasn't Althea's wish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Althea hated Gale, she still wished him safety and peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was how Althea loved. She could stop loving or hating, but she never wished for harm to Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why her family had moved quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her decision to leave was to avoid ruining Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had let Gale go, but Gale might not let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's fate was already set. Without Queenie's interference, he and Penelope wouldn't last long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they lived together, their life would be chaotic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope loved to have fun and often stayed out all night, while Gale wasn't very capable. Their fragile love couldn't endure much turmoil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea knew this too. She wouldn't punish or seek revenge, but Gale was destined for a miserable marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time proved Althea's prediction right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was already a rift between the two now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed and said, "Althea, that night's incident was orchestrated by Queenie and Penelope."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="251.html">« Prev</a><a href="253.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
