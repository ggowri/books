My son had just been born, and you imprisoned me. A car accident left me paralyzed for over ten years, reduced to a vegetative state. Charlie, what right do you have to take over my life?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After decades of endurance, Andrew finally brought his enemy to justice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his furious expression, Charlie felt a surge of satisfaction in his heart. "Andrew, this is your fate, and Steven has his destiny too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you hadn't been too kind back then, naively trusting lies and donating a huge sum, the two virus outbreaks would never have happened."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does being deceived mean you're completely blameless?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! Since then, I haven't donated a single cent. You took my place and funded billions for him to develop new viruses, causing so many deaths."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Charlie, you're worse than a beast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew glared angrily, the only thing he could do in this life was to hide his whereabouts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only wanted to ensure his son's safe growth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He secretly supported his son and suppressed Charlie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since his misfortune, the Mysterium Organization vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until Charlie returned to headquarters that the perfect chance to catch them all came.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, they would have to lie low for decades more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Charlie and George were taken away, Andrew shakily stood up at the scene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He bowed deeply in front of the camera.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am ashamed before you all. It took years to locate their headquarters, so I apologize to everyone here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew bowed deeply once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The livestream chat was filled with mixed opinions, with some understanding and others criticizing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some accused Andrew of being selfish, knowing it was a virus but not stopping Charlie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Andrew only found out after the outbreak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone had mixed opinions, but Andrew truly did his best.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the reporters and relevant departments left, Andrew looked at Steven and Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said with guilt and excitement, "Steven, Diana, I dragged you into this and made you suffer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "Please don't blame yourself. As long as you're safe, that's all that matters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven, however, lowered his head in silence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since childhood, it felt as if his father had already passed away in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never felt fatherly love; all he received were criticism and beatings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only his grandparents would protect him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment when the truth was revealed, he felt no joy. Instead, he couldn't accept the harm he had endured since childhood and found it hard to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those wounds took away his courage to love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how strong he is, he still has a weakness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This net that had enveloped him since birth bound him for over twenty years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew looked at Steven, his eyes full of worry. "Steven, my sins are unforgivable. You don't have to forgive me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven remained silent as a statue, standing beside Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sensed the chill around him and gently tugged at his sleeve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven just gave her a faint glance before turning and leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt very puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She blinked in confusion, not understanding why he still chose to leave during this moment of reunion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Isn't this supposed to be a perfect ending?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The family is finally reunited, so why avoid it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana roughly understood the knot in Steven's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he couldn't forgive was the years of hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He dared not love or care for anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people he cares about always suffer because of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in this life, everyone around him is safe and sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Owen was saved, and it was outsiders who got hurt instead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward hurriedly said, "Diana, go stay with Steven, he needs you right now. He loves you, trust me. Uh, I never lie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt there was always a barrier between her and Steven. Although they admired each other, they seemed strangely distant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, thank you for your hard work. We'll head back home first and wait for you. Your grandfather and the others will arrive soon. By then, I'll tell you the whole truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward looked anxiously at the doorway.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven is kind-hearted by nature, he just doesn't know how to face his biological father.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded and said, "Alright, Edward. You go ahead, I'll check it out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She jogged to catch up with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him enter the elevator, Diana quickly followed him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was slightly startled when he saw her chasing after him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Diana caught up with him, she didn't know how to comfort him. In the end, he had to process some of the pain on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking for a moment, she gently held his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the soft touch in his palm, Steven finally met Diana's gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..." Diana awkwardly laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She and Steven had never truly spent time together, and now they didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, do you want a drink?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled helplessly. "Can you drink?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I get drunk after two glasses of red wine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked down at her holding his book and said, "Alright. Let's go for a drink."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of embarrassment flashed in Diana's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her affectionately, then at those slender and beautiful hands, and said gently, "Weren't you the one who suggested I drink?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Wasn't she here to comfort me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew she was good at comforting people, and when he once refused to take medicine, she patiently persuaded him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Diana had 100% patience with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing he was serious, Diana hesitated and said, "Oh, we've just recovered not long ago, so a little red wine won't hurt. But if we drink too much, I'm afraid it might cause trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would only fall into a deep sleep after getting drunk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nodded and said, "Alright, I'll arrange it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out his phone to contact Evan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they exited the elevator, Evan was already waiting at the door with the car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan got out of the car and said, "Mr. Gellar, leave the rest to me. You two go relax."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven in confusion and asked, "Where should we go to relax?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1085.html">« Prev</a><a href="1087.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
