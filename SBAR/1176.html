"No, Mom&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale: "Mom&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric: "Mom&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their anguished cries pierced the air. Diana lunged forward, but Steven caught her, pulling her back. "Diana, don't. There are cushions down there&mdash;she won't die. We need to get downstairs first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears poured down Diana's cheeks. She never thought Paula would jump with Queenie just to protect her. She hadn't wanted to forgive her before, but after getting pregnant&mdash;even though her morning sickness wasn't too bad&mdash;she still felt wiped out and miserable. No matter where she sat, she was drowsy. It made her think back to Paula's situation all those years ago&mdash;not even knowing who the real father was, but still choosing to have her. Without knowing Queenie wasn't her biological daughter, Paula had still given Queenie all the love she had. If she hadn't been switched by Jeff back then, Paula would've loved her the exact same way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, she can't die. I just forgave her. I just called her Mom. How can she leave me like this? She was about to meet her grandchildren."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't wrap her head around the fact that her biological mother had jumped right in front of her. This hurt worse than when she'd been pushed off in her past life. Watching someone you love suffer before your eyes was more painful than dying yourself. As a soul, watching Grandpa and Tobias leave one by one had been agony that twisted her very being. In this life, she'd let everything go to avoid that pain again. But here she was, living through it anyway.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw how worked up she was getting and worried about her. He whispered gently, "Diana, calm down. She'll be okay. Let's go check on her now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: "Okay!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Olivia. "Seven, can you untie them? I need to get Diana downstairs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia glanced at Steven, her brow furrowing slightly. "I can tell Diana's carrying twins. She's been super sleepy lately, and this pregnancy isn't stable. She can't get this upset, or the babies could be in danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Steven's eyes widened. "Twins?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia smiled and nodded. "Yep! Each baby brings its own luck. Get Diana downstairs fast&mdash;the energy up here isn't good for her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked down at Diana, joy and shock washing over him. He held her even tighter, his steps becoming more sure. Diana was stunned too, staring at Olivia as her grief got pushed aside for a moment. "Seven, you're saying I'm having twins?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia grinned playfully. "Yes! Don't be so sad&mdash;your mom's gonna be fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, Paula had come to her senses, saving herself and her four sons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia walked over and untied the ropes around the two brothers. They bolted downstairs immediately. Olivia shook her head and followed them down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula lay unconscious on the rescue airbag. Queenie, who'd fallen with her, wasn't so lucky. When she fell, she got thrown to the side, landing hard on the ground just inches from the airbag. Her body was convulsing, blood trickling from her mouth. But she was still breathing, her eyes locked on Steven as he carried Diana over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why... why is it me this time... and not Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven set Diana down. Diana looked down at Queenie from above.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, how's it feel to be dying? How's it feel to be broken? Does it hurt? Are you scared? Desperate?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stared up at her, her eyes filled not with despair or pain, but pure hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie wanted to curse Diana, but before the words could leave her lips, she took her last breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stepped in front of Diana, blocking her view. "Diana, don't look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's cold gaze fixed on Queenie's lifeless body. This was the best ending she could've gotten. Past life debts, paid in full this time around. Even in death, she showed zero remorse, still dreaming about second chances. Fat chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's voice cracked with tears. "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned toward her mother on the rescue airbag. The paramedics were checking her over, trying to bring Queenie back. But Queenie was already gone. After five minutes of CPR, they officially called it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was fine&mdash;just knocked out from the fall. She'd be okay once she came to. When Diana heard the doctor say she was alright, she finally let out the breath she'd been holding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all followed the ambulance to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the hospital, Gale, Eric, and Althea were already there. Diana and Steven sat nearby, waiting for Paula to wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric and Gale walked over. Gale looked at Diana carefully. "Diana, do you really forgive us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The awful things he'd done didn't deserve forgiveness. Being siblings might only be for this lifetime&mdash;after this, they might never get another shot at being family. He lived with regret every single day. If he could do it all over, he'd never waste his life like that, and he'd never pick a father like Jeff.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes were red and puffy. She'd always been a crier&mdash;could tear up just reading a book. Now with her birth mother in danger, the tears wouldn't stop. Hearing Gale's words, her eyes filled up again. "Do you seriously have to ask me this right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her getting worked up and knowing she was pregnant, Gale quickly crouched down to calm her. "Diana, don't get upset. I won't ask anymore. Just talking to me means you've forgiven us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a look. "I'm forgiving you because you're Harlan's dad and Althea's husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea smiled nearby. Diana was all talk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric chuckled too. "Tobias, don't tick Diana off. We're gonna be uncles."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana: "..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want them as her kid's uncles. Her child's uncles were three drop-dead gorgeous, tall, loaded guys. These clowns had been benched ages ago. It wasn't that she wouldn't cut them some slack&mdash;they just didn't think things through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale smiled too. Diana had just forgiven them; things would get better with time. "Diana, thanks for forgiving us. Why don't you two head home? Mom's fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I'm good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sat quietly beside her, his face stormy, keeping her close.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea asked with a grin, "Diana, twins?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Althea and shook her head. "I don't know. Steven said so, so probably. I was gonna get checked at the hospital tomorrow&mdash;didn't have time today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea and Gale had already gotten their marriage license, so she called Paula mom now too. "Mom's fine. Why don't you go get checked?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I'll wait till Mom wakes up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't in the mood for tests right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea knew she couldn't talk her out of it, so she dropped it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula didn't wake up until afternoon. Diana had already dozed off in Steven's arms twice. When she saw Paula's eyes open, she perked up and rushed to the bedside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her, Paula immediately broke down. "Diana, are you okay?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1175.html">« Prev</a><a href="1177.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
