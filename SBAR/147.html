Queenie collapsed weakly into Steven's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven, who had been good to Queenie for years, called out anxiously, "Queenie, Queenie, what's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's lips twitched involuntarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, why is it always the same act? Can't you try something new?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned. "Diana, you made her faint out of anger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing the worry and concern in Steven's eyes still stung Diana's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had truly loved this man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had loved him fiercely, with all the passion of her youth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled brightly at Steven. "Steven, look at yourself. You can't help but worry about her, afraid something will happen. You love her so much, why make her your mistress? When you held her at night, whispered sweet things, and promised her forever, where did you place me? Where did you place her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've shown you the videos. You two really disgust me. You've been in contact for two years, doing all these intimate things, so why keep me tied to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, it's not what it seems," Steven quickly explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't want to hear it. She walked over and stepped hard on Queenie's foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah..." Queenie screamed in pain and jumped up like a startled frog, flailing her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She jumped right out of Steven's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Pfft... haha..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Pfft... haha."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna and Evan burst into laughter in unison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked so ridiculous that they couldn't help but laugh, even if it wasn't fair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Steven with a mocking gaze, as if he were a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her delicate brows hinted at a faint trace of pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He really could tolerate this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven pressed his lips together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed too. "Steven, admit it. You're a fool. Queenie always pretends to faint at crucial moments because she doesn't want to take responsibility, just like when she faked her own kidnapping and cried herself unconscious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You just love these weepy women who faint at every problem. So much for your protective instinct, huh? I don't understand why you won't just get a divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana found this whole situation pointless, but Queenie and Steven seemed to find it endlessly amusing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Dealing with these people was exhausting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at her deeply. Her bright eyes, full of life, seemed to hold countless stars, glowing with charm. Her face was delicate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was full of spirit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Standing tall before her, his gaze cold but his lips smiling slightly, he said, "Diana, I know you're sharp-tongued, but you need to give me a chance to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't love Queenie. I've told you before, the only reason I've been kind to her is because she saved my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed mockingly. "Steven, how can you treat Queenie like that? Do you realize your 'kindness' to her goes beyond what's normal for a couple? No couple treats each other this well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You teamed up with her family to bully me, your rightful wife, just to repay a debt. To me, you're worse than a scumbag. No matter what you say, we're getting divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Because of the pain you two caused me, I will never forgive you for the rest of my life," Diana said, her eyes full of hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's heart clenched painfully. Diana truly hated him!</p><div class="pagination"><a href="146.html">« Prev</a><a href="148.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
