"Why so loud! You scared me!" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven noticed her pouting lips, which made her look lively and adorable. In his mind, Diana was usually a calm and steady person, the perfect wife. Throughout their marriage, she would prepare meals every day and wait for him to come home. This was the first time he had seen her so animated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During his darkest moments, when he couldn't see, she was always there for him. As long as she didn't clash with Queenie, he realized he could actually get along well with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana noticed his silence and continued, "Ex-husband, if you are sick, go see a veterinarian. You forced me to sign a divorce agreement at Queenie's birthday party, and I left with nothing. You signed it, too. The deal is now in effect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now&nbsp;you asked me to go home? What's wrong with you? I'm giving room to you and your true love. Now please get out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Speaking of this, Diana remembered that every time she and Steven quarreled about Queenie, it was she who went to ask Steven to make peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of how humble she used to be, Diana slapped herself hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned slightly. "Why are you hitting yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "Just to let me sober up and stop loving a scumbag."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This sentence seemed to irritate Steven, and his eyes suddenly turned gloomy. "Diana, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, the five minutes are up." Tobias showed up at the door with a charming smile on his face. His handsome appearance was alluring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What a handsome young man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven&rsquo;s face was good looking but boring, Diana would be impressed by every handsome young guy now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana quickly stretched out her hand. "Hold me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias smiled lovingly as he walked in, "You&rsquo;ve gain some weight. I can't hold you. How about carrying you on my back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana patted his shoulder hard and said, "You'll have hemorrhoids by say that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's curse was always practical and kind of terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright. Go back and have a good rest. Your feet are seriously injured and there was a giant anesthetic. You will have no sense of taste for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then there's no point in me eating lobster. I can't even taste it." Diana felt so unhappy&mdash;no wonder her mouth felt numb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Come up." Tobias patted his broad back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Somehow, Diana felt touched, and tears welled up in her eyes. In her previous life, Tobias was killed by a killer hired by Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this life, as long as she avoided that scumbag, Steven, these things would not happen, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana lay on his back, her voice choked with sobs. "Tobias, let's go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias heard the sobs in her tone and felt distressed. Why did she cry again? Because of that scum? How much had she suffered?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at the two of them angrily. "Diana, do you want to go with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana restrained her emotions, showing arrogance, yet her voice was soft due to her sadness. "Ex-husband, why do you care where I go? We are divorced. Divorced, okay? As you wish. Although your appearance is still good, I am tired of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias couldn't help laughing. This was Diana, the treasure he had raised since childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had harsh words but was a sweetheart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at Diana deeply for a while, then left angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tobias, let's go." Diana leaned on his back. Tobias' back was so warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well! Let's go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias carried her downstairs. In fact, she was very light. To marry Steven, she seldom contacted them. Fortunately, this silly girl finally came to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana lay quietly on him and said guiltily, "Tobias, I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias paused and said in a low voice, "Diana, why are you saying sorry?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="9.html">« Prev</a><a href="11.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
