"Let's go, Diana. I don't want to stay here. I'll take you to eat something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank tensed his jaw and stared at Paige's angry look with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked a few steps and suddenly stopped and looked back at Frank. "Frank, you slandered me on the Internet. I won't let you go. What you said led netizens to abuse me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You know what I'm like, but you are biased towards Queenie and slandered me at will. In fact, you don't care whether it's true or not. You just want those people to curse me while you enjoy the pleasure of being virtuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, you will know how painful it is when you experience it. You made me become a laughingstock that those people could trample on my dignity and scold me just for fun. I will let you pay the price one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned. He just wanted to ruin Diana's reputation and make her come back to beg him, but he didn't expect her to be so vindictive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, as long as you apologize to Queenie and admit your mistake, I can let you go and control the public opinion," Frank sneered, with evil in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned her head to look at Frank and then looked at Elsie beside him. "Apologize to Queenie? You are dreaming. Bring your delusion to your grave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, how dare you curse me to death?" Frank was furious, thinking she was so vicious that she cursed him to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to run over and beat Diana, but Elsie stopped him. She gently comforted him. "Calm down, Frank. Diana is so vicious. Just ignore her. Her life was not easy after she left your family. She seduced Mr. Watson and became the design director. Now that she's gone, don't bother with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana heard this and suddenly stopped. She stared at Elsie and sneered, "Elsie, you like to speak ill on others. I will definitely give you a big gift at your wedding. Just wait and see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie widened her eyes in a panic. She glared at Diana's back but dared not say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie thought, "Diana looks so confident. Does she really know something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go, Elsie. Diana is crazy." Frank pulled Elsie to sit down not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the restaurant, Paige burst into tears. She looked at the calm Diana and cried even sadder. "Diana, you actually have such a family! I was so stupid that I actually took a fancy to Frank. That bastard!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana saw Paige crying heartbreakingly and patted her on the shoulder to comfort her. "Paige, don't cry. Women's situation in the workplace is not always peaceful. We should not tolerate others from now on. The more we tolerate them, the less respect we will get. We can't stop villains from accusing us, but we can seek justice for ourselves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige nodded sadly, tears streaming down her face. "Diana, you are right. It's easy to destroy a woman's reputation, and these rumors are devastating to a woman. But Frank still slandered you on the Internet. It really chills my heart."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="288.html">« Prev</a><a href="290.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
