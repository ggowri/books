She was curious to see how her rival would act this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy, admiring Diana's beauty, grinned. "Eric, I didn't know you had such a stunning sister. She's more than just pretty. She's a goddess."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words shattered his otherwise charming image. He came off more like a rogue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people were like that. They sat quietly, resembling a high-born prince, but once they spoke, they instantly turned into a common thug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric thought it a pity that he already had Queenie as a sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was expendable and he didn't feel much for this sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Morrison, I'll give you this sister. Do as you please, just don't kill her. She's the least favored child in our family. If she dies, we'll just dispose of the body. You won't have any trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you let me go now, Mr. Morrison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt numb from the pain but was still hurt by his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy stood up with a smile, looking at Eric in disbelief. "Wow! Eric, I've heard your family treats adopted daughters poorly, but I didn't think it was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'd sacrifice your sister just to save yourself? You're unworthy to be my rival. I misjudged you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric paled, staring at Diana. "Diana, you can't blame me. Blame your lack of affection of our parents. You always compete with Queenie, even for her man. Your downfall is my gift to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's so funny, Diana?" he shivered in cold air, but his hostility remained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her sharp gaze pierced through him. "Eric, I've left your family behind and signed a severance. Our ties are cut. If you're still dreaming, it's time to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't come to see you. I came to see Mr. Morrison. Why would I save you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You said that letting me save you was a gift from you? Who do you think you are, the emperor?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are worthless for me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you..." Eric was furious. Frank said that Diana had changed, and she truly had&mdash;she had become tougher and more beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you always dress so beautifully? You can't stand to see Queenie shine, can you? Trying to steal her spotlight? You wicked woman, why do you always have to compete with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their most cherished sister was Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This vicious woman, even with their blood ties, could never be his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana suddenly walked over and slapped Eric hard across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, how dare you compare me to that wicked woman, Queenie? Disgusting!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric stared at her in disbelief, his eyes blazing with rage. "You dare to hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already done it. What else is there to fear? Eric, I've told you before, I have no ties to your family. I didn't come here to save you. It's time for you to wake up from your dream."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She then looked at Elroy. "Mr. Morrison, whether Eric lives or dies has nothing to do with me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, how can you be so cruel..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana coldly interrupted him. "You just called me cruel. Shouldn't I take your advice and be even more so? What are you, a spoiled child coming to me for help?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you..." He was so infuriated that he nearly passed out. If he weren't tied to the tires, he would have jumped up to hit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana ignored him, instead focusing on Elroy's handsome face. With a bright smile and a teasing tone, she declared, "Mr. Morrison, I&mdash;Diana&mdash;am here to challenge you."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="436.html">« Prev</a><a href="438.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
