The room was filled with Cecil's usual business partners, glasses clinking, laughter flowing freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After attending a few of these events, she was starting to get used to the rhythm of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shifted slightly, glancing down at her injured knee. The discomfort was persistent&mdash;another month in a wheelchair, another month of frustration. She had to make sure she fully healed. There could be no lasting damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she couldn't help but think Cecil didn't need to go through all this trouble. A fancy banquet wouldn't be enough to take Queenie down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she really needed was solid evidence&mdash;proof of Queenie's crimes. Something that would bury her for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, if it isn't Ms. Bishop." A voice dripped with mockery. "Sitting all alone at the main table? Looks like you're on your way to becoming the new lady of the Farley family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a woman, Queenie could see it clearly&mdash;Cecil cared about Diana. More than that, he liked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, Diana hadn't even noticed when Queenie arrived. Amused by her petty tone, she smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood before her, dazzling as ever, a sharp-edged smirk on her face. "Oh? What's wrong with me sitting here? If you want the seat, take it. But make sure you've earned it first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie let out a low laugh, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of arguing, she pulled out a chair and sat beside Diana, tilting her head slightly. "Well, I'm sitting now. What are you going to do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana barely spared her a glance. "Who said I was going to do anything? Funny how you assume I would."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's expression darkened, her eyes filled with venom. "Tell me, Diana, does it make you happy to see me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Happy?" Diana let out a short laugh, shaking her head. The very idea was ridiculous. Who could be happy after going through all of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could possibly enjoy being manipulated, betrayed, and dragged through the mud?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met Queenie's glare, searching for the root of her hatred. It made no sense. Where did all this resentment come from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had always been obsessed with Steven. She had been the one to run away from their marriage, not Diana. So why did she act like she had been wronged?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, neither of us got to choose the lives we were born into. We were swapped at birth by Jeff. You took my place and enjoyed over twenty years of wealth and privilege. And yet, you still act like you were robbed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't me who ruined your life. Your own ambition did that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it me who placed you in the Marsh family? Was it me who made you who you are today? No. You did that to yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You always blame others for your mistakes, never once stopping to look at yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You live your life like a parasite, feeding on admiration and praise to feel like you belong. It's pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stiffened. Diana's voice was calm, but every word landed like a knife, cutting deep. Her fingers curled against her lap, but her expression remained cold. "Yeah, It's my fault. I had everything, and I still managed to destroy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lashes lowered, a shadow of regret passing through her eyes. "But I lost because of my parents. They're the reason I failed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't hesitate. "No. You lost because of you. You knew what kind of people your real parents were. A man willing to abandon his wife and children for you&mdash;did you really think he wouldn't turn on you one day? You knew it, and yet, you still bet everything on him. Because you were desperate to be the rightful daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The truth is, if Paula had her way, you wouldn't have had to lift a finger to secure a life of wealth and privilege. She adored you&mdash;so much so that she was willing to give up her own daughter for you. Her love for you was never any less than what your real mother gave you. If anything, it was more. Look at where you are now. Instead of chasing status and power, you could have lived a life of quiet luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mother had it easy&mdash;enjoying the riches of a household she never belonged to, living off a fortune that was never hers, never feeling a shred of guilt. And you? You're just like her. No shame, no remorse. A mistress who wears the title like a badge of honor. Like mother, like daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead. Cry injustice all you want. But the only person who ever did this to you was you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana held Queenie's gaze, unwavering. Her posture remained relaxed, but there was no mistaking the sharpness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stiffened, her breath hitching slightly as the realization settled in. Her fingers dug into the fabric of her dress, pressing hard against her knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't look away, her expression cool, almost detached. But behind that calm exterior was something else&mdash;pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie exhaled, but it did little to ease the weight in her chest. She had always known what kind of people her real parents were. She had understood, deep down, that their loyalty was conditional. And yet, she had still chosen to gamble everything on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced herself to steady her breathing, but the bitterness clung to her like a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze locked onto Diana, sharp and unrelenting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You," she said, voice measured, "you were always my greatest enemy. I just refused to see it. I thought you were weak, someone insignificant. Someone I could break whenever I wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the truth is, the one I underestimated was the one who destroyed me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the worst part? I don't even know why I hate you. I mean, we didn't even have beef before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't lying. She had spent years consumed by her obsession with Diana's downfall, but even now, she couldn't explain where it had started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana studied her, tilting her head slightly like she was considering something she had already figured out. "I guess that's something I'll never have an answer to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's shoulders stiffened, a strange sense of unease creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The frustration boiled beneath her skin, but there was something else too&mdash;something colder, something she couldn't quite name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a slow breath, her voice dropping. "Diana... I had a dream once. In that dream, I killed all of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression didn't change, but something in her eyes darkened. Her voice hardly remained steady. "And in that dream... the person who killed me was&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven," Queenie cut her off, watching the way Diana's fingers tensed slightly against the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a split second, there was something unreadable in her expression. Then, Diana let out a slow breath, her gaze cool and distant. If Queenie wanted to believe that, then let her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's voice turned thoughtful, almost contemplative. "So, we've both come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes scanned Diana's face, searching for a flicker of hesitation, some sign of doubt. But there was nothing. "You returned before me. You knew what I would do. You set everything up before I even realized what was happening. That's why I lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she had come here tonight&mdash;to confirm her suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she had her answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebirth wasn't just a desperate fantasy. It was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a quiet laugh, though her eyes glistened with unshed tears. In her past life, she had lost the child she had been carrying when her life ended. That pain had never faded. "Yes. I came back first. I watched you for years after I died&mdash;saw you climb higher, saw you use every man in your path, stepping over them one by one until you became exactly what you wanted&mdash;a queen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie curled her fingers into a fist, pressing her nails into her palm. So, she had made it. She had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a strange mix of exhilaration and disbelief through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slow smirk pulled at her lips, her gaze gleaming with something unreadable. "Diana, I have a secret for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes narrowed slightly, her focus sharpening. "What secret?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1018.html">« Prev</a><a href="1020.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
