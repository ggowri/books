Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, those few ruffians who tried to bully Ms. Bishop last night were hired by someone, but they refuse to reveal who was behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, these four people are in custody, and Ms. Bishop and Ms. Sutton disagree with a settlement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since they did not suffer any substantial harm, those people will be released after being detained for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked somewhat displeased and said, "Go and check their identities, as well as their bank account transactions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan then told Steven about what happened at the restaurant last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned slightly after listening. "Do you think Queenie deliberately fell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She did it on purpose. I was standing not far away at the time, and she's used this kind of trick many times before," Evan said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't respond to him, but instead said, "I'll take a walk nearby. You go and prepare the boat." His voice was extremely heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven left with steady steps, and Evan, looking at Steven's upright figure, felt somewhat puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "That's all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he also understood that Steven didn't want to hear any more about this matter, fearing that he might be one of those fools.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan, holding the breakfast in his hand, chased after him and said, "Mr. Gellar, you haven't had breakfast yet. You need to eat something, or your stomach problems will act up again. When that happens, it can be very painful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan chased after him, and Steven said to him, "Evan, you are the only person I trust."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of these words, his loyalty to him increased even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this level of trust he placed in him was enough to make Evan willing to die for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned to look at the breakfast in his hand, took it, and sat down on a wooden stool nearby. He pointed to the other side and said, "Let's sit down and eat together. The view here is very nice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan sat down, and they started to have some seafood soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the distance was the sea. The morning breeze was gentle, yet a bit chilly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan smiled and said, "Mr. Gellar, it's been a long time since I felt this relaxed. The scenery truly has the power to heal and uplift one's mood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned his head and looked at him with a profound gaze, "Evan, regarding Jace's matter, have Edison keep an eye on it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan nodded. "Okay! I'll get it done after coming back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan lowered his head, looking at the seafood soup in his hands, finding it not very tasty. To be honest, the soup made by Diana was much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven wasn't too keen on eating either. He turned his head to look towards the room where Diana was staying, only to see Cecil standing on the balcony making a phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was seething with anger inside. The Diana he knew used to be very obedient and innocent, always revolving around him, never having eyes for anyone else, and never getting entangled with other men. Now, she had let Cecil into her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven took a few sips and then pushed the soup aside. Diana was no longer a good girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan knew that it was not to his taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said nothing and drank his share slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had to have breakfast. With a lot of things to do every day, he needed the energy to sustain himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Queenie was exhausted dealing with the mess, Diana was eating breakfast leisurely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them had breakfast and were about to head downstairs when they encountered Queenie in the elevator. Her complexion was extremely poor; she hadn't slept well all night, and her dark circles were very noticeable, lacking her usual luster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil saw Queenie and laughed unrestrainedly, "Oh! Isn't this our big star? Why do you look so haggard today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was also surprised to see Cecil, wondering why he was also on the island.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="401.html">« Prev</a><a href="403.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
