Mom's not having me anymore, and racing's off the table. I get nothing now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you're doing great. How about I join you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was visibly shocked as she realized Eric couldn't even participate in the car race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused to herself, "He's truly a failure, coddled to the point of uselessness. Without a dime to his name for racing or any skill to speak of, he's destined to leech off me for survival. He would end up doing whatever I said. However, what I certainly didn't need was another loyal lapdog."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, you'll be doing odd jobs for me, like being my assistant or driver. Up for that?" Queenie teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'm up for it. Business has been tough, and Mom's company's about to crash. I just want to make money now, or I'll be a burden on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, eyeing his handsome face. She thought, "Useless, go to hell! My brother was coming back, and these scraps couldn't get in the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My scheme to undermine Paula had backfired spectacularly, leading to significant losses on my end. But there was no turning back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must press forward. I refused to be the Marsh family's adopted daughter forever. My family had to be together, legitimately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, why don't you be my driver?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie pondered, seeking a chance to dispose of Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's eyes lit up with a grin. "Queenie, that's perfect. I would've never thought of it. I can still be a driver."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned to him with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. Inside, she harbored nothing but contempt. "By the way, have you checked on Frank? Do you ask Diana? If it weren't for her and Paige, Frank would've been married ages ago. Even if Elsie was married before, she was the woman Frank liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana and Paige are too meddlesome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric knew Frank was in grave danger, and Gale was disabled and rumored to be in a foul mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I asked her, and she said you know Elsie. If you can contact Elsie, we can find Frank. Queenie, give me Elsie's number, and I'll ask if Frank's with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, explaining, "Eric, after the wedding fell apart, Elsie left furious and blocked us. I don't have her contact info anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank had died long ago, but fortunately, Paula was still in the dark. This was good news. It would torment Paula and her parents in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's face clouded over. "Alright then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the siblings entered, Jeff had already returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, he swallowed the blue pill, and what followed was a series of sex with Amelie. He felt fantastic, but today, something was off. His body ached, and he was so exhausted he didn't want to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Queenie's home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric suppressed his disgust, looking at Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was waiting for Queenie to discuss important matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed Paula might have discovered something, avoiding coming home with the excuse of work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his eyes, looked at Queenie, and smiled warmly, "Queenie, it's great you're back. Head to your room. I need to talk to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew he wanted to discuss Paula's company, but his frail appearance worried her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff waved it off. "I'm fine. I just didn't rest well last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up slowly, and his phone rang. It was Amelie, the one who revitalized him last night. He hurried upstairs to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked. "Amelie, didn't we just part ways? Missing me already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amelie's voice crumbled in panic, "Jeff, save me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="500.html">« Prev</a><a href="502.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
