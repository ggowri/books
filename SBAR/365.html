"Being with Queenie bothered me. She often called me and asked me to come over. But before Diana revealed the truth, I liked her kindness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even her kindness is just an act, and Diana went along with her act. In your eyes, Diana is cruel, and her presence only set off Queenie's kindness," Owen interrupted with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's expression turned blank. He had mulled over this matter for countless nights but couldn't wrap his head around it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps he had cared about Queenie, which was why he had given her anything she needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what did Queenie truly want?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven thought of it. His long-suppressed emotions came crashing down in an instant, leaving sadness washing over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, who he always thought genuinely cared about him, actually had ulterior motives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana truly loved him, yet he turned a blind eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven completely came around. He thanked Owen and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one could predict feelings. Perhaps they might not end up together in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dropping Queenie off, instead of going back, Frank sat in the car. After deliberation, he decided to call Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige had been exhausted from the competition these days. The ringing of her phone in the middle of the night startled her, and she thought that something had happened to a team member.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing it was Frank's number, she was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The island was windy, making it hard to fall asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shouted into the phone, "Frank, are you out of your mind? You called me at this hour and woke me up! Do you know how hard it is to sleep here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned. Paige rarely yelled at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression turned cold. "Paige, I didn't mean to wake you up. I'm getting married. Will you come to my wedding or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige fumed, "No, I won't attend your wedding! You're going to marry that wicked woman, and you make me sick! I had just dreamt of kissing a hot guy, and you ruined it. Screw you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Paige hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being awakened, she couldn't fall back asleep. She lay still on the bed, gazing at the ceiling with eyes wide open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hated Frank for having disturbed her sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reflecting on how she had been pursuing Frank for all these years, she felt regretful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had been desk mates since the first grade of elementary school and had gone to junior high school, high school, and college together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed so coincidental that she thought it was destined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But two years ago, Elsie suddenly appeared by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie knew that Paige had feelings for Frank and conspired against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Frank always favored Elsie, even asking her to apologize to Elsie for the trivial matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He always pitied Elsie, claiming that Paige came from a wealthy family and urging her to tolerate Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was utterly shocked by his request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simply because her family was well-off, should she tolerate the woman who had always bullied her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Paige thought of this, she felt infuriated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She exclaimed, "Screw men. I'm happy being alone!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="364.html">« Prev</a><a href="366.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
