He turned to Diana. "Diana, I heard you got nothing from your divorce. Steven is stingy. How about I get you 20% of the shares?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at him coldly. "No, I don't want it. Just resolve this quickly. I can't stand being here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her with confusion, not understanding her stance. He took a step back, distancing himself from Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil then addressed Steven. "If Mr. Gellar wants to keep Queenie, it's simple. Just hand over the land in the west to our family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Steven agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil quickly secured the contract and smiled at Queenie. "Ms. Marsh, I just got hundreds of millions of dollars for nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie cried silently, shooting him a fierce glare. There was a dangerous glint in Cecil's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the contract in hand, Cecil turned to Olivia and Diana. "Diana, let's go. Dinner's on me. With these extra millions, I'll give you 20% of the profit if it pans out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No, I don't want it." Without looking back, she left with Olivia and Cecil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula watched Diana leave, slumping onto the sofa. She realized she had truly lost her daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie clung to Steven, her voice filled with anger. "Steven, we can't let Diana get away with this. They're framing you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her coldly. "Queenie, why don't you want the police involved? I can uncover what they can. I'll tolerate you this one last time for saving my life. If it happens again, you're on your own."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Steven walked out, leaving Queenie standing there, stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven no longer believed her. Jeff's face was pale. He kicked the two men in frustration. "You idiots, you couldn't even handle this. Get out!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men scrambled away as Paula sat on the sofa, tears streaming down her face. It was too late for regrets.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the gate, Steven was about to leave when he overheard Cecil. "Diana, why not let me use the evidence? With it, we could put Queenie away for at least 20 years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed. "It's pointless. Steven will do everything to protect her. Even with evidence, Queenie won't be touched. Whoever is backing Queenie is after your family. I don't know who, so be careful."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil nodded. "I almost misjudged you again today. I'll keep investigating. I suspect Steven and Queenie are trying to take over the Farley family. They both showed up when my grandma was poisoned, likely to gain access to our secrets."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was slightly surprised by his accurate guess. This time, her actions had changed the Farley family's fate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not Steven," she said. "That person wants the Gellar family too. I'll investigate and let you know. I'm too tired for dinner&mdash;I just want to go home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana turned to leave, Cecil stopped her. "Diana, aren't you sad about marrying someone like Steven?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caught off guard, Diana smiled and replied honestly, "No, I'm not sad. I don't love him anymore, so there's nothing to mourn."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil grinned. "Diana, my looks and family background are on par with Steven's. Would you consider going out with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was taken aback, remembering how he had bullied her before. Yet, in this life, he seemed genuinely interested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and declined, "Mr. Farley, I appreciate it, but I'm considering dating Alexander."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil laughed in disbelief. "What? Alexander is as old as Steven. You're only twenty-three, and they're twenty-eight. I'm just a year older than you&mdash;we're a perfect match."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled back. "Cecil, do you know why I would consider dating Alexander?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="60.html">« Prev</a><a href="62.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
