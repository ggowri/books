Only then could she feel satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time Steven hurt Diana, Queenie found it thrilling. It was the most exhilarating feeling for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'll be sure to invite you to my wedding. I want you to see for yourself how happy I'll be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Queenie fixed her gaze on Diana, watching her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a meaningful smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, you'll really invite me? That's bold of you. I have a whole lot of dirt on you, Queenie. Imagine if I decided to spill it all when you're up on stage. Wouldn't that be embarrassing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you..." Queenie's chest tightened with anger. No matter what she said, it always ended with her being the one infuriated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana never lost her composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's expression darkened suddenly as she turned to Luna. "Tell the guards at the entrance that this woman is no longer allowed here. If she so much as steps foot on our property, have her thrown out immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, don't you dare!" Mario snapped, his gaze cold and menacing. He had assumed Diana would never amount to anything, yet here she was, taking charge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana arched an eyebrow, her gaze sharp. She had nearly forgotten about him until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, she remembered. In every one of Queenie's countless schemes, this man had always been involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mario, this is my turf. Why wouldn't I dare? You've helped Queenie pull off so many despicable stunts. Aren't you afraid of karma catching up with you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When she framed me, you were the one working in the shadows. Once I find the evidence, I'll make sure you end up behind bars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario had always been the ultimate accomplice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His loyalty to Queenie had never wavered, and Diana knew their bond ran deep. It wasn't something a few words could sever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario let out a cold laugh. "I have no idea what you're talking about. What crimes? What evidence? You sound delusional, throwing around baseless accusations like a lunatic."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're selfish and malicious. How dare you blame others for your misery?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face twisted into a grotesque mask of rage. His voice echoed through the vast hall, eerie and jarring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't flinch. She had made up her mind. She wouldn't give them another chance to hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, she was certain, Queenie would experience her own version of hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna had already summoned the guards. "Throw these two out of here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie glared at Diana with seething hatred. But she was powerless. This was Diana's domain now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the guards could act, Mario shoved Queenie out the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna escorted Diana to the lounge before leaving her alone with Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula sat across from Diana, who didn't bother with small talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana simply waited for Paula to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula understood that Diana had no interest in hearing apologies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, Jeff isn't your biological father," Paula said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The revelation hit Diana like a thunderbolt. She nearly stood up from her wheelchair in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that instant, Diana suddenly understood why Paula had treated her with such disdain when she first came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, Paula and Jeff had been deeply in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had been the blemish on their perfect romance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Heh..." Diana chuckled bitterly. "If that's the case, you should never have taken me back. The moment you saw me, you should've told me the truth, that my father was someone else. If I had stayed away, maybe your family could've been happy together forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cursed silently. "What a godforsaken family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both of them had affairs. What kind of mess is this? And I thought..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears welled up in Diana's bright eyes, sliding silently down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula wasn't sure how she felt at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But one thing was clear. Diana's return had filled her with anger and resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hated that Diana had snatched away her beloved daughter's fianc&eacute;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without Diana's presence, Queenie could've married into the Gellar family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had been selfish then. The Gellar family was a true aristocratic household, and their influence would've greatly benefited her business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had adored Queenie, but everything changed when Diana returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Gellars had forced Steven to marry Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From that moment on, Paula had harbored a deep resentment toward her own daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the truth was like a dagger to her heart, leaving her scarred and bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To please the ingrate Queenie, she had hurt her biological daughter again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, every time she thought of it, she felt nothing but regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula shook her head. "Diana, I know you're mocking me. But when the truth came out, I knew I could never grow old happily with that family. If you hadn't reminded me, I would've lost everything by now, while Queenie and her little family of three lived the good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I don't know who your father is. That year, I had an accident during a business trip. Your father saved me. That night, he was drugged and ended up in my room. He somehow knew my company was in financial trouble and offered me money, on the condition that if I got pregnant, I had to keep the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe it was the alcohol, but I agreed. Back then, Jeff was always away, claiming to be busy. Looking back, I think he was with Amelie then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her world was spinning out of control. She didn't even know how to respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a thought struck her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I always suspected he wasn't my father. That's why I secretly ran two DNA tests after coming back. But both tests confirmed he was. How do you explain that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula looked genuinely surprised. She shook her head. "I didn't know you had DNA tests done. But I'm certain he's not your father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was sure of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, she had been humiliated, and after the stimulate, she had no one else to rely on. Jeff was of no help in her business, so she had to struggle on her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was exhausted during that time, and on top of that, Jeff kept saying he was too busy to come home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man that night was handsome, and she needed the money, so she didn't turn him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night had been her deepest secret, something she had never told anyone. Later, when her family was doing better, she forgot about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then one day, Jeff suddenly said their daughter had been switched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And without warning, Diana came back into their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I didn't hate you because of your birth. It was only after discovering the switch that I grew distant. I had raised Queenie with so much care, and your return only intensified my resentment. At some point, I even felt relieved. If Queenie wasn't my biological daughter, I could spoil her without guilt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ironically, at that time, she even felt guilty toward Jeff.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="979.html">« Prev</a><a href="981.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
