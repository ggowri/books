You're my woman. How could I not care about you? Didn't I give you the drug? Just use it to keep him under control. Once you slip it to him, he won't be able to do much. You're smart, and I know you understand what I mean. You're mine, so I won't allow you to get all cozy with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes glistened with tears. She wasn't even sure why she was crying. It felt like he was just saying these things to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand. I'll find an opportunity to act," she replied, her voice low and heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. With our people working behind the scenes, that plot of land you bought for the Farley family has attracted a lot of investors. Once this project is completed, we'll be one step closer to our goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the Gellar family gets stronger, it'll be good for us, too. Queenie, everything I'm doing is for our future. I know your dreams, and I promise I'll help you achieve them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt her heart soften at his gentle words. She still loved him. "Alright, I understand. Don't worry, everything will go according to plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. I love you, Queenie," he said, his voice tender and doting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Queenie felt a sudden warmth. "I know. Thank you for loving me. I'm really happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ended the call with a smile and headed to the restaurant. She called Mario to join her for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven arrived at the office, he had just settled into his chair when his phone buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked it up to find a text message from an unknown number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading the message, anger surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you're even more vicious than I thought," he muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that, once again, he would be failing Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he called Evan into his office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan came in carrying Steven's dinner. "Mr. Gellar, your dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Steven said, motioning for him to set it down. He handed Evan his phone, showing him the text.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan read it and was stunned. "Oh my God, Mr. Gellar. Is Queenie planning to target you, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do next? Can we trust this information? Who sent it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven opened the meal box but found he had no appetite. "I have no idea who sent it. But I plan to play along and see when she makes her move. You must keep this news between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan looked at him sympathetically. He couldn't believe there was no one who truly cared for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to have a pretty good impression of Queenie, and he never expected her to do something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a bite of his dinner but barely tasted it. "After Paula's company went bankrupt, did you find out who acquired it?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan replied, "The buyer is named Felicity Aniston, but she's just a front. She's not the real owner; she's the acting CEO of the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we heard that name when we were in Woodston. Cecil got caught up in a scheme by that woman there. She's probably working with Queenie. That's what I heard from Ms. Bishop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call her Mrs. Gellar. We're married now. Why are you still calling her Ms. Bishop?" Steven interrupted, his voice sharp with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan hesitated, then said, "Mr. Gellar, I used to call her Mrs. Gellar. But you once said she was just a country girl and didn't deserve that title."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regret washed over him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="591.html">« Prev</a><a href="593.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
