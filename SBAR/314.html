His presence was overwhelming, those eyes devoid of emotion. This version of Steven made her incredibly uneasy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head, playing the victim. "Steven, I don't know why she'd try to frame me. Maybe she's just jealous of how much you dote on me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's gaze grew even colder at her words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He almost wished Diana was jealous.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wished she would confront him like she used to, "Steven, we're the ones who are married. Why are you having dinner alone with Queenie?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, he thought she was being unreasonable. Now, seeing her dining with Alexander, he finally understood Diana's fury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie watched Steven's face, unable to read his mood. Her emotions were on a rollercoaster. Just one look from him was enough to send chills down her spine.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had never made her feel this way before.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go," Steven said coldly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie asked, puzzled, "Steven, why won't you get divorced? Don't you love me anymore? You promised you'd marry me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not getting divorced, but you're not marrying me either..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've been testing your character, Queenie. Your recent actions have left me deeply disappointed."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven turned and walked away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face went pale as she watched his retreating figure, her expression darkening.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was all that damn Diana's fault. If it weren't for Diana, Steven couldn't think she had a bad character!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie ran after him to explain. "Steven, Diana set me up. You..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about the time you staged your own kidnapping? Did she hold a knife to your throat and force you to fake your own abduction?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That was a mistake. I did it for you. I thought if I came back, you'd marry me. How could I do something like that otherwise? I only did it because I love you." Queenie's tears flowed freely. Her pale face and teary eyes made her look pitiful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven didn't look at her as he strode down the stairs.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie gritted her teeth as she watched Steven's back. This man really didn't understand love.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Growing up in a dysfunctional family, he didn't even know who he truly loved.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter. She knew how to handle him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you're dead meat."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie pulled out her phone and fired off a message to Mario.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Leak the news about Diana's plagiarism. Buy trending spots. Spare no expense. I want her reputation utterly destroyed.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario replied: [Ms. Marsh, Diana's already trending. Leaking this now won't have much impact. Plus, someone's suppressing the topic.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[The other side's digging into this. We've done damage control, but they seem to know it's you. They sent over a photo of you with Mr. Gellar.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie saw red when she looked at it. It was Diana!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew all along! No way! Steven hadn't divorced Diana yet. If this photo got out, Queenie would be branded a homewrecker.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It'd tank her career. Steven was her meal ticket - acting was her fastest way to cash.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Steven cut her off, she couldn't bring herself to beg.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their relationship was already on thin ice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie headed downstairs, but instead of Steven, Evan was waiting by the curb.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie approached him. "Evan, where's your boss?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan smiled apologetically. "Mr. Gellar had to leave. I'm here to take you home, Ms. Marsh."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie gritted her teeth, her eyes still puffy from crying.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He didn't even wait for me," she grumbled, glancing at the bustling street.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew Steven was slipping away. It felt like falling from grace, and it stung.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, this couldn't happen!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had to marry her! It was the only way he could quietly take his place as the Gellar family heir!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go to Steven's villa." Evan said nothing and drove her to Steven's place.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she wouldn't be able to see Steven there anyway.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Alexander headed home together, as they lived in the same neighborhood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven followed in his car. Alexander noticed and deliberately took a detour through the city.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked, puzzled, "What's going on, Alexander? Why are we heading downtown?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander glanced in the rearview mirror, a flicker of anger in his eyes. "Steven's tailing us."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was surprised. "Why would Steven be following me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered Steven's warning, insisting she return home tonight.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="313.html">« Prev</a><a href="315.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
