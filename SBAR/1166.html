"Mr. Morrison, quit being jealous and hurry up and find us a sister-in-law. That way we'll actually get decent meals. I can't take eating takeout every damn day&mdash;look, I'm practically wasting away here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy shot him a look. The guy's face was round as a bowling ball. "You want my Diana cooking for you losers? In your dreams."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team member pointed at the convoy in the distance. "Mr. Morrison, check out Irving's crew. His Diana whips up amazing food for the whole team every single day. And get this&mdash;before they eat, they make a point of strutting over here to rub it in our faces, going on and on about how incredible their sister-in-law's cooking is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was genuinely jealous. Home-cooked meals smelled incredible, and here he was choking down greasy food every day&mdash;he'd been backed up for three days straight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy burst out laughing. "That's because their team's even more broke than we are, so they cook to save cash. Besides, if I had a Diana, she'd be cooking just for me. She wouldn't be slaving away for you bunch of degenerates. Why should my Diana put herself through that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team member was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Something told him Elroy was going to make one hell of a boyfriend someday. He chuckled. "Mr. Morrison, you've always been a stand-up guy in our book."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy frowned. "You've been riding with me for years, and you're just figuring out I'm decent now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team member grinned. "Mr. Morrison, want me to officially give you a nice guy certificate?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy: "Get the hell out of here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At 2 PM sharp, the race kicked off. The pit area and safe zones were absolutely packed. Steven had done one run with Diana before, but he knew official competitions were a whole different beast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Diana. She'd slipped into her racing suit, helmet tucked under her arm while she chatted and laughed with Elroy. She looked fierce and confident, her eyes blazing with determination. He walked over, his voice soft: "Diana, win or lose, just stay safe out there. Don't forget&mdash;you've got me waiting for you. Don't throw your life away just to cross the finish line first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana caught his dramatic farewell expression and couldn't help cracking up. "Chill out, we're professionals&mdash;we value our necks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She reached out and grabbed his hand. Usually so cold and untouchable, he seemed almost fragile now. That killer instinct from before had melted into pure tenderness. "Don't worry. Wait for me to come back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Elroy. "Let's do this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy smiled. "Let's do this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Elroy was about to head out, Irving strolled up with his crew in tow. "Morrison, fancy meeting you here. Word is you guys brought some eye candy to join the party this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elroy and Irving had been bitter rivals for years. Elroy consistently outperformed Irving, and Irving carried some serious grudges&mdash;hell, outright hatred&mdash;toward Elroy. Elroy dropped his laid-back act, his eyes turning ice-cold. "Irving, from the second Diana joined up, you've been watching our every move like a hawk. Asking that question now? Bit redundant, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Irving's gaze landed on Diana. That face was absolutely stunning&mdash;one look was enough to knock anyone flat. He flashed a smile and made his move: "Well hello there, gorgeous. I'm Irving. If you ever feel like switching teams, my door's always open."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha!" Dantai couldn't hold back a laugh. "Irving, give it up already. She's just a weekend warrior who races for kicks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing "weekend warrior," Irving visibly relaxed. "Even better. This lovely lady's got beauty and heart. If you ever need anything&mdash;anything at all&mdash;don't hesitate to hit me up. Our team's got serious backing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Diana could get a word in, Elroy cut him off: "Irving, you're really gonna brag about that pocket change? Quit wasting everyone's time&mdash;we've got a race to run."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Elroy came off as carefree and wild, he knew Irving was the type who'd do anything to win. If Irving caught wind of Diana's real driving skills, he'd probably try to sabotage her when nobody was looking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He left with a cocky grin. Elroy warned Diana, "Diana, don't fall for his sweet talk. The guy's a total scumbag&mdash;he'll do anything to win a race."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana chuckled. "No worries. Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana caught Steven's worried look and smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry. I'll be back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay," Steven replied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven settled into the lounge to wait for their return. The place buzzed with noise, so he found a quiet corner. His refined, aloof presence drew attention as he occasionally glanced at the electronic screen nearby. When the time came, engines roared to life, and The Grand Prix Championship kicked off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cars shot from the starting line like arrows, kicking up clouds of dust as competitors gave chase in a tight pack heading into the winding section. Steven didn't dare blink. Diana's silver lightning stood out brilliantly among the flashy racers. His eyes locked onto that silver car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was way faster than what he'd experienced earlier. Entering the curves, Diana handled the wheel with precision&mdash;braking, downshifting, turning&mdash;all in one fluid motion, quickly overtaking several opponents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Irving's Bluetooth headset crackled with his teammate's voice: "Irving, who's that silver car? Their technique is incredible. They've passed our entire team. At this rate, we're gonna lose. I'm catching up to you now&mdash;you go after them, I'll back you up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Irving watched the silver racer pull further ahead. The driver knew this track inside and out, especially those turns&mdash;that precision was something he'd never seen before. "Damn it," Irving snarled. "How is there such a strong opponent in this race? Didn't we check beforehand? I thought Elroy was our biggest threat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His teammate shot back, "Cut the chatter. I'll bump her later so you can pass. We have to win this race to get more funding for the World Racing Championship. We've fought too hard to get here&mdash;we can't let money issues kill our dreams now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it," Irving replied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Irving's expression darkened as he suddenly accelerated, trying to overtake. But Elroy was ahead of him&mdash;the kid had serious skills and usually edged him out in every race. This time though, Elroy wasn't pulling away like usual, which seemed off. Irving tried to pass, but Elroy seemed to anticipate every move, blocking his chances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whole way, Irving found himself stuck behind Elroy with no opening to overtake. When both their cars reached the top three, that silver racer still held first place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time seemed to blur until they neared the finish line. Irving decided to make his move, recklessly charging toward Elroy's car. Accelerating while wearing a cold smile, he muttered, "Elroy, since you want to die, I'll </span><span>grant your wish."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1165.html">« Prev</a><a href="1167.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
