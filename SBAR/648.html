Video? What video?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "Mrs. Foliot, it's already late today, and everyone is very hungry. Why don't we have dinner first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have dinner? What about showing everyone how you usually have sex with a man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lily snapped her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the big screen, an explicit video of Amelie and Mark together instantly appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had gained weight and was corpulent. He held her head and moved it back and forth with a joyful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They made love violently, and her groans were very lewd.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young ladies were horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly pivoted around, stood in front of Diana, and pressed his hands on her ears to prevent her from seeing or hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's attention was on the video, and no one noticed his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time that Diana was so close to him. As she heard his strong heartbeat, her heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark, when are you going to divorce your irritable wife? It would be nice for the two of us to live together."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, what are you talking about? If we live together, it's not life but chaos. Although my wife has a bad temper, her family has helped me in ways that you can't. Isn't it good for us to keep such a relationship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can only meet you for 20 days a month. I am not satisfied. If you use a little trick, your wife will die, and you can take away all the property of her family. Then, we can be together every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation dumbfounded everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie showed great respect for Mark's dignity. Delight overwhelmed him. All men were so shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men's dignity could sometimes become a subtle emotional yoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When faced with a strong woman, they would become tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The confidence, independence, and outstanding abilities of strong women made them feel uneasy and threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were afraid of being overshadowed and appearing insignificant and powerless in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in front of women who adored them, their dignity was greatly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could fully display their masculinity and enjoy the pleasure of being admired.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was Mark's state of mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie collapsed and yelled, "That's not the case. Turn it off. Turn it off quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sneered, "Amelie, are you scared now? When you said that I was an irritable, unattractive woman and plotted against my family's property, why weren't you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would show Amelie what it was like to be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had a slender figure and delicate facial features. Her serious expression made her look difficult to get along with. In fact, she just had a bad temper. But sometimes, it was also a disguise to protect herself. Had she been weak, her fortune would have been snatched away long ago.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't like to target women. Women were originally victims, and it was difficult for them to survive in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, despite being aware that women shouldn't make things difficult for other women, Amelie still said such things to her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was unforgivable, so Lily prepared this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took a step back uncomfortably. At that moment, she felt as if her face had been stepped on and rubbed on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff, in particular, wished he could get out of the place at once. Was this the woman he had made every effort to divorce Paula and to marry?&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she be so annoying?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gazed at Paula in panic.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="647.html">« Prev</a><a href="649.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
