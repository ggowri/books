She had underestimated this fake victim act of Queenie's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna showed Diana the livestream; people were already criticizing her, but she didn't care at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their perspectives were worlds apart, so she just smiled. Let them say what they wanted. She didn't live for their approval.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In this second chance at life, the only thing she cared about was exacting satisfying revenge. Nothing else mattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing more and more people tuning into the livestream, she wondered, "Am I really this popular?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were already over 100,000 viewers in the livestream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She considered whether she should become a social media influencer while she was at it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nah, she didn't want to be tempted by fame and fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The key to unraveling today's situation lay with Zoey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew about the relationship between Harry and Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was ready to expose Queenie's true colors with just her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana blinked and looked at Queenie, pretending to be confused. "Ms. Marsh, are we even that close? Why would I frame you? Tell me, why would I even bother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie froze, fearing that Diana might reveal her affair with Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn't afford to be labeled as a homewrecker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie began to regret using such tactics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had really changed; she was nothing like before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana raised her phone. "Since you're so determined to play fragile...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then I'll tell everyone the real truth and let this lovely lady here see how her son is being used."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana raised her phone toward the reporters, smiling boldly. "Everyone, I have some more truth here. Would you like to see it? Let's see what kind of person your 'ideal wife' really is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie watched Diana wave her phone and started to panic. She had come in such a rush this morning and hadn't prepared enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had only arranged for some trolls to attack Diana online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana leaned down and whispered to Zoey, making sure only the two of them could hear, "If Queenie goes down, your son will be dragged down with her for the rest of his life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reporters were all fixated on Diana's phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The viewers in the livestream were also glued to their screens, their curiosity getting the better of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sensing the moment was right, Zoey finally spoke up, "Diana, you seduced my son! You're the one framing him on purpose! I've heard you've done the same to your own family. You're known for this kind of thing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at her and smiled sweetly. "Do you know my family? Didn't you do your research before coming here? I'm an orphan. How could I have family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana gave Queenie a smile. "Ms. Marsh, I gave you a chance earlier, but you didn't take it. You insisted on throwing dirt at me, so now I have no choice. Everyone, let's watch the video of Queenie and Harry at Manville Hotel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's face went deathly pale.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="143.html">« Prev</a><a href="145.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
