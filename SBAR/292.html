She looked at the angry Luna and said with a smile, "What's wrong, Luna?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna put the tablet in front of her and said, "Diana, look. Frank is a bastard. He actually asked someone to retouch pictures to slander you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was shocked when she saw these pictures. She knew Frank was selfish, but she didn't expect him to be so selfish and cruel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused for a while, then looked at Luna helplessly and said, "Luna, prepare some things for the livestream. I'll let Frank explain it. The company had just cooperated with the Powell family, and I won't let the news ruin the cooperation. Let the public relations department remain calm. I will handle this matter myself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since Frank wants to ruin my reputation, I'll destroy his company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna nodded. "Okay! Diana, go to the car and wait for me. I'll be there soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the car, Diana told Luna about the plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan suddenly called Diana and said, "Diana, leave this matter to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana refused him. "No, I can handle it myself. You should take care of the company's affairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan could only nod. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked cold. She hadn't gotten back at Frank before because his fate was already determined. However, he dared to slander her again, and Diana would show her mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Frank was her brother, he did not care about Diana's feelings and interests at all. Diana would not let him go this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie went to Gellar Group to see Steven, who was drinking coffee in the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had seen the news about Diana and felt overjoyed, thinking, "Frank did not let me down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many netizens cursed Diana. [That bitch can actually be a designer, then I can be a teacher!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[I've seen Diana. She's sexy.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Kick Diana out of the design industry. She has brought shame to designers.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Kick Diana out of the design industry.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of the comments were like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had seen the news, and his face turned even colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Queenie's smile, Steven knew she had seen the news, too. According to the IP address, he knew that someone in Frank's company had exposed the news. Steven said, "Frank made such a fuss. If the thing that I give you five million dollars every month is exposed, your situation will probably be worse off than Diana's."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was stunned, feeling anger rising in her heart. She thought, "He hasn't given me money recently."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie pouted, "Steven, Diana destroyed our relationship. Even if it is exposed, I'm not afraid of the result. You spoil me, and you give me money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew very well that as long as Steven pampered her, she could be willful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had a meaningful smile. "Diana said that she would sue me and recover all the property I had given you before I divorced her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie understood that Steven wanted to help Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie trusted Steven too much. She should have asked him to add the words "voluntary gift" when he transferred her money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie thought, "If Diana really sues me and exposes this matter, my reputation will be ruined. No, I can't let this happen. I should do something."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="291.html">« Prev</a><a href="293.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
