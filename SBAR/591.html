Now, seeing her walk away from him for another man, Steven finally understood that same pain. The ache he felt made him so irritable. He was so angry that he wanted to destroy everything around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie noticed Steven's silence and grew anxious. She thought, "If Steven really has feelings for Diana, it will only speed up her downfall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven avoided her gaze, smiling with a sharp edge. "Queenie, I used to like you because I thought you were kind. But tell me, Queenie, are you truly kind?" His smile was laced with cruelty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had rarely seen Steven like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt her heart tremble. She said, "Steven, I can explain what happened at the birthday party. Diana refused to sign the divorce papers, so I had to do something. I only wanted to force her to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you always want Diana gone? You used to look down on her, calling her a country bumpkin, and you never wanted to take her anywhere. You wouldn't even admit you were married to her, let alone bring her to events."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You always took me. I was the fianc&eacute;e you recognized. Handling this quietly was in your best interest. Steven, everything I did was for you. How can you blame me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt wronged. She wiped her tears, unable to understand why Steven kept bringing this up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Could it be he believed those photos Diana sent him, showing me with some thug?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he even find out about Levi?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi was the celebrity she had been collaborating with. It was Levi who had made the first move on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During those nights on the island, they had been together. Steven hadn't wanted to touch her, and she felt a bit neglected. Levi was quite skilled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Steven spotted Diana walking with Alexander. His face darkened with anger. "Get out. Don't make me say it twice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's phone suddenly rang. Seeing the caller ID, she quickly got out of the car and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glared out the window, seething. "Drive. Take me to the office," he ordered Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..." Evan thought he had misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't understand why they weren't heading to Diana's place but to the office instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Mr. Gellar. I'm taking us to the office," he said, raising his voice slightly to make sure Steven heard. He thought maybe Steven had made a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven kept staring angrily out the window, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Evan drove straight to the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie watched Steven's car pull away, feeling furious. "Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, how's Steven doing lately? Is he still treating you well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's tone was icy. "I just saw him. I feel like I'm losing control over him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then do what I told you. I've got everything set up. You can also wait a couple of months and find a chance to drug him. As long as you two end up together..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie grew increasingly irritated at his words and cut him off. "Do you really not mind me being with Steven? Do you actually love me, or are you just using me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, feeling a chill settle inside her. She had everything, yet felt like she had nothing. That emptiness gnawed at her, leaving her restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she still felt hollow, so empty it frightened her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered if it was because she had lost Steven's protection. Over the years, she had grown used to his care. Now that he had changed, she didn't know how to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When you asked me to see other men, I really wanted to ask you, do you truly love me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="590.html">« Prev</a><a href="592.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
