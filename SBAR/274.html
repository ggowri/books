A smile flickered in her clear eyes. She had grappled with this dilemma on several occasions, ultimately choosing simplicity by deciding to address Alexander simply as "Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, let's go. I've made reservations for the day; now's the perfect time," Alexander said, moving forward to the car. He opened the door with grace, ushering Diana inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna was arranged by Alexander to ride in the car behind, leaving Diana and Alexander alone in the front car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As their car pulled away, Steven, sitting in a nearby vehicle, wore a somber expression. The departure of Diana and Alexander left him haunted by the memory of her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had never smiled like that in his presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, during the half year when he was confined to a wheelchair, she had offered him such smiles and encouragement. Perhaps, due to his different state of mind at the time, he had failed to appreciate her vibrant and luminous smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He clenched his hands tightly on his knees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes remained fixed on their car until it vanished from sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan sensed the oppressive atmosphere in the car and dared not speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long silence, he asked, "Mr. Gellar, shall we head home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven finally snapped out of his reverie, hoarsely replying, "Follow them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Evan murmured, his mind already drifting towards the sweet sleep at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even men needed their rest to stay youthful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, his voice gruff, "I asked you to follow them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan whispered under his breath, "Before, when Ms. Bishop was at home, you refused to come back even though she prepared dinner for you every day. Why are you chasing after Ms. Bishop now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Evan muttered quietly, Steven caught every word, so his mood darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He leaned back, lips pressed tightly together, but inside, a surge of anger threatened to erupt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the hospital, Jeff awoke, unaware of his surroundings. His eyes were vacant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sat beside him, asking anxiously, "Dad, what's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to her oversight, Paula had avoided a trap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This morning, Queenie discovered that Paula had abandoned her daily tonic, put off by its unpalatable flavor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her plan to trap Paula had failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing her voice, Jeff turned to look at Queenie with confusion in his eyes. "Who are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was horrified, yelling with fear, "Dad, what's wrong with you? How can you not recognize me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff turned his gaze back to the window, lost in thought. Who was he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why couldn't he remember?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie grabbed her phone and dialed Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The shrill ring of the phone pierced the silence at the doorstep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie spun around to see Paula entering the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, what's wrong with Dad? How can he not recognize me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie mused silently, "No, my father couldn't afford to be in trouble at this moment."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="273.html">« Prev</a><a href="275.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
