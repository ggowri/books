"Samuel, let me make something clear. Queenie's target was never you. It was always your cousin, Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You remember that banquet, don't you? I broke Cecil's hands to prove my innocence, and in the end, he believed me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He also figured out Queenie's game. She staged Madam Gellar's accident at the pool and used the chance to save her, earning her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when Madam Gellar didn't warm up to her, Queenie switched gears. She came after you and the Foliot family instead. Judging by her timeline, now that the Foliots are finished, your family is next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, we can put on a little show and let you see her true colors for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't need to go to these lengths. Someone else's fate wasn't her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fewer enemies were always better than more. If she could flip this into an advantage, why not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not that she intended to make Samuel a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just wanted to throw a wrench into Queenie's plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's expression darkened. "What kind of plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tone sharpened. "Call her. Tell her you've killed me. See how she reacts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel hesitated, his grip tightening on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't a bad idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought back to that banquet&mdash;how Diana had snapped Cecil's wrist so effortlessly, only to reset it moments later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Cecil had teamed up with Diana, and they'd destroyed Queenie's plan in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Samuel hadn't seen Queenie as anything but charming. He'd been caught in her web of promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? He'd been burned twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At twenty-four, he wasn't ready to let her drag him down a third time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Picking up his phone, he dialed Queenie's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie answered almost instantly, as if she'd been waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel? How did it go? Is Diana dead?" she asked, her voice laced with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel switched to speakerphone, his voice trembling. "Queenie... I... I killed her. What do I do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's excitement was palpable. "You really did it? You killed Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's voice wavered. "Yes. She's lying in a pool of blood. What do I do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's laugh was bright, almost musical. "Samuel, tonight's snowstorm is perfect. Wrap her body in a blanket, take her out of the city, and dump her in the river."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Samuel's voice cracked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's tone turned smug, dripping with satisfaction. "Dispose of the evidence, Samuel. That's the only way you'll get away with this. Once you've taken care of her, call me back. I'll tell you what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know this must feel heavy, but trust me&mdash;revenge is the sweetest high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enjoy it, Samuel. You've earned it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter, light and sweet, sent chills down Samuel's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, it sounded like it came from somewhere far darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana scoffed softly, her eyes gleaming with icy contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Queenie Marsh in her true form&mdash;a manipulative, calculated predator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's voice shook. "But... but I can't move her on my own. Queenie, I'm scared. </span><span>Can't you come help me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only did this because of you," he added, his voice desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's tone turned sharp, almost cutting. "What are you talking about? I never told you to kill Diana. Don't drag me into this mess. It was all your idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has nothing to do with me. If you can't move the body, call your parents. They adore you; they'll help cover it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've always been your safety net. Let them clean up your mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's grip tightened, his knuckles white. Anger burned in his chest as her words sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, do you even hear yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're throwing me under the bus after everything I've done for you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I risked everything for you. I killed for you! And now you want to drag my parents into this? They're the only people in my life who truly care about me. I did all of this for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you have to come and help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's voice turned icy, devoid of warmth. "Fine. Give me your address. I'll send the police to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face twisted in disbelief. "You're calling the cops on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else would you expect? A murderer like you can't outrun the law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel tried to speak, but Queenie cut him off. "And don't even think about blaming me. I never told you to kill anyone. This is all on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's voice cracked. "You're just trying to get rid of me, aren't you? You want me out of the way so you can take everything from my family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That last line was what he'd been meaning to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's response was chilling in its honesty. "Exactly. You made your choices, Samuel. None of this has anything to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel felt his heart sink, a cold, hollow weight settling in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it was true after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's real goal had never been anything less than the complete takeover of the Farley family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you..." he began, his voice trembling with a mix of disbelief and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now that you're a murderer, you're no longer a threat to me. Your family's assets? I'll be taking them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel stared at his phone, her words echoing like a death knell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said nothing, giving him space to process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhere, Queenie was likely celebrating her supposed victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single tear slid down Samuel's cheek, landing on the phone screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the grief of betrayal&mdash;it was the weight of realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been wrong from the start. All of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Revenge against Diana had been fueled by nothing but wounded pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, it was clear&mdash;Diana had done nothing to deserve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had all been his own arrogance&mdash;hitting Diana with his car and then brazenly convincing himself he'd done nothing wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, Samuel looked up at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat quietly, her presence steady and unyielding, her gaze calm and untarnished by malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rising unsteadily to his feet, Samuel stumbled toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's hand, hidden under the blanket, tensed in readiness. If he attacked, she'd strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the last part she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing, Samuel? Stay back," she warned, her voice sharp and wary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped in front of her and, to her surprise, dropped to his knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened. "What are you doing? Why are you kneeling? A man's pride is worth gold&mdash;save it for something that matters."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="932.html">« Prev</a><a href="934.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
