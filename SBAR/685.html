She didn't want to encounter these bad things. But she just happened to encounter them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff quickly called out to Diana, saying, "Diana, stop right there."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to look at him, asking, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff walked over, his eyes stern. "Diana, it was my fault for abandoning you. But your mother still owes 500 million dollars. Can't your project make 500 million dollars? If you help your mother pay off this debt, I will remarry your mother immediately. Your mother has only loved me in her life. Can you bear to see her sad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned, thinking, "How shameless he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jeff Marsh, I have severed my relationship with you long ago. I have already repaid you for your kindness in raising me. I am sorry that I cannot comply with your shameless excuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, do you want to see your mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is my mother?" Diana glanced at him coldly. "Mr. Jeff Marsh, you chose the path. How could you regret it in just one month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face turned pale. He was embarrassed and wished he could find a hole to crawl into.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, without money, he could not maintain his dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, everyone makes mistakes. I know I was wrong. Help your mother pay back the 500 million dollars, and I will remarry your mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula interrupted him, "Jeff, don't go too far. I don't want to remarry. Don't force Diana. How dare you ask her to do this? Have you ever raised her for a day or taken care of her for a day?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, remember, Diana doesn't owe you anything. You will be punished."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had already lost all hope. But at this moment, her heart still ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Diana, don't worry about my debts. Just live your life well."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana went to the mall. Paula cried as she looked at Diana's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff looked dejected. Looking at Paula's leaving back, he regretted it deeply. But it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, I didn't expect you to be so despicable. How dare you come to beg Paula to remarry you?" Amelie looked at Jeff with a mocking look.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff turned to look at her. "Amelie, where did you go last night? Did you go to see Mark again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's eyes slightly dodged, and she said, "I slept at home last night. I didn't go anywhere. I was sleeping in my room. Jeff, if you really care about me, you will know that I was at home last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff frowned. "But you didn't go into my room last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Amelie was used to pretending. He hadn't noticed it before. But now, they lived together, and her true nature was fully exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Jeff had been bewildered by the bright future described by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had wanted to get rid of the reputation of being spineless. But he was wrong. His reputation had been ruined since he married Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was furious. "After all this, how can I sleep in the same bed with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was in a bad mood and didn't want to argue with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he just turned around and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana came out of the mall, she saw Amelie still wearing last night's clothes. She narrowed her eyes, thinking, "Could Amelie be the one who wanted to kill Mrs. Foliot last night?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="684.html">« Prev</a><a href="686.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
