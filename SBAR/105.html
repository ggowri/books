You and the Marsh family kept humiliating and making trouble for her. She needs to be respected. Don&#x27;t ruin her happiness at this moment. Please.]</p><p>[I&#x27;ve looked into Diana and didn&#x27;t expect her to be so outstanding. Now she&#x27;s with another man. You just want her back to take care of you. It&#x27;s not love.]</p><p>Owen was disgusted by the hypocrisy of the Marsh family, who derived satisfaction from Diana&#x27;s suffering.</p><p>Especially Queenie, who always spoke ill of Diana.</p><p>By claiming to suffer grievances for Diana, Queenie, in fact, tried to direct others&#x27; anger towards her.</p><p>However hard Diana argued for herself, no one was willing to trust her.</p><p>Owen&#x27;s message irritated Steven, even his handsome face was twisted out of rage. When he viciously scolded Diana, he only felt satisfied.</p><p>Why did Diana bully Queenie?</p><p>She was already married into the Gellar family.</p><p>But later, it was proven that Queenie did all that to sow discord between Diana and him.</p><p>Steven&#x27;s eyes grew increasingly cold.</p><p>&quot;Even Owen thought I went too far. Am I really that bad?&quot;</p><p>Steven was raised by his grandparents. His childhood wasn&#x27;t happy at all.</p><p>He rarely had emotions and thus didn&#x27;t understand much about love.</p><p>Steven sneered. &quot;How could Owen know what is on my mind?&quot;</p><p>He threw back the car keys he was holding and went back to work.</p><p>On the beach.</p><p>Diana, Tobias, and Olivia were all tired.</p><p>Sitting under an umbrella, they were eating barbecue while drinking beer.</p><p>Diana hadn&#x27;t felt this relaxed in a long time. After the divorce, she could have fun freely without worrying whether Steven had forgotten to take meals.</p><p>She no longer needed to fulfill the duty to choose a proper gift for Steven when he went to attend a banquet.</p><p>She turned to Olivia while eating a lamb skewer. &quot;Olivia, are you happy?&quot;</p><p>Olivia hadn&#x27;t relaxed for a long time, either. She was drenched in sweat.</p><p>She nodded with a smile. &quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p>Diana was about to speak when her phone rang.</p><p>She picked it up. It was from Queenie.</p><p>Diana frowned. She actually forgot to block this woman&#x27;s number.</p><p>Today was supposed to be a happy day. No way for this annoying woman to come bother her!</p><p>&quot;Why does this bitch keep badgering me?&quot;</p><p>She pressed the answer button. &quot;Hello!&quot; Her tone was impatient.</p><p>Queenie was cheerful. &quot;Diana, I&#x27;m going to get engaged to Steven. Are you jealous?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="104.html">« Prev</a><a href="106.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
