The murderous glint in his deep-set eyes made her instinctively step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was terrifying. Even through a screen, the chill he radiated could suffocate anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his icy voice rang out. "Miss, do you really think I'd mistake someone else for my wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom why everyone seemed to believe Queenie was his spouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since marrying Diana, he had never intended to marry Queenie. The kindness he showed Queenie stemmed from gratitude for her saving his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had overlooked Diana's feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had asked for a divorce multiple times because he had misunderstood Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one thing was undeniable. He had been wrong. Diana had cared for him during his toughest two years, yet he hadn't shown her the gratitude she deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven realized he had done what all despicable men do, taking the one who loved him for granted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of his past missteps sliced through him like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what was all that affectionate behavior with Queenie?" Janet sneered. "Why act so intimate every day, making everyone think you're a couple?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, you're the worst kind of man! You have a wife, but you can't even maintain proper boundaries with another woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet suddenly turned to Sam. "And you think you're innocent, Sam? Every time I schemed against Carolyn, you blindly believed me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You never trusted your wife. She's been completely let down by you. If it weren't for her pregnancy, do you think she would've endured this marriage for so long?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whenever I said I was hurt or in pain, you'd drop everything to be with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sent her intimate photos of us on purpose, making her think we were having an affair. She's been wanting to leave you for ages! If your love was truly unshakable, would I have been able to come between you two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed a trembling finger at both men, her tone dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you, greedy, selfish men. You both have wives at home yet can't resist flirting with other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to be divorced. You deserve to live in misery. Men like you don't deserve happiness or true companionship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Steven, she continued her tirade. "Steven, everyone sees you and Queenie as a perfect match. Nobody even knows Diana is your wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder she doesn't want to admit she's married to you. Married men like you, who don't respect boundaries, hurt their wives the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You never feel you crossed a line, but you always hurt your wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your wives give you respect, work tirelessly for the family, and allow you to focus on your careers. But what do you do in return? You cross lines with other women and engage in inappropriate touches and intimate relationships. When your wives endure it silently, you keep testing their limits until they've had enough and leave you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't crossed the line, what can other women do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men like you blame the women when relationships fail, but if you had kept your distance and honored your commitments, no other woman could have seduced you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most hypocritical are you two. And you, Steven, are the biggest hypocrite. You act like a loving couple with Queenie in front of the media.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You send her millions of dollars every month, buying her an island, yet ignoring your real wife. Tsk, a man like you has no right to scold me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, stunned. For all Janet's venom, her words struck uncomfortably close to the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam froze, his expression bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, all those times you said you were in pain, or hurt, or being stalked...you did it on purpose to make me come to you, just so Carolyn would misunderstand me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Janet said coolly. "Sam, can you honestly say you never had feelings for me? That you were never tempted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You also see me as a woman, and your thoughts have wavered. That's why you keep running towards me. Every time you rushed to my side, leaving Carolyn behind, you hurt her. She's tolerated you, endured you to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now she can't take it anymore, and that's why she's divorcing you. Your love wasn't exclusive, and that's why I have found a way in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, why blame all the faults on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet screamed with heart-wrenching intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once planned to marry Sam. After all, they weren't biological siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Carolyn had swooped in and stolen him away halfway through, leaving Janet with a grudge that had never faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam was completely baffled. He had no idea what she meant by "boundaries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, I'm nothing like Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't want to be dragged into this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly regretted being here at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, you got hurt, and I left my wife alone at home to check on you because I cared about you as my sister. But you twisted my concern to drive a wedge between me and my wife. You say I don't respect boundaries? Have I ever slept with you or even held your hand? I've only ever loved my wife. You claimed your leg was injured, so I had a bodyguard carry you. Did I ever hold you myself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So tell me, what do you mean by 'boundaries,' huh?" Sam was livid. "If it weren't for your constant fake illnesses, would I have left Carolyn for you? Would I have been stuck cleaning up your mess? You took advantage of my kindness again and again because you knew I wouldn't abandon you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven openly flirts around. Did I ever flirt with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sighed. This wasn't the argument he wanted to be a part of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet froze, unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She admitted her intentions weren't pure. Sam had never treated her romantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was a woman, and women understood each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Sam rushed to her side, she knew Carolyn would feel jealous and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Sam," Janet finally said, her voice bitter, "every time you left Carolyn to come to me, she grew more disheartened. If I can't be happy, then neither of you deserve happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, so this was all part of your plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn stood at the doorway, her eyes red with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam, seeing her there, quickly went to support her. "Honey, why are you out of bed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn glared at him. "If I hadn't woken up, I might never have seen this for what it really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, it's good you're here. Now we don't have to get a divorce. This was all Janet's doing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam was furious. If it weren't for the chance traffic jam that led him to Diana, saving his wife and child, he wouldn't have discovered Janet's twisted schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really couldn't believe that his sister could have such horrible thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Janet's face went pale as she realized Carolyn had heard everything. "So what if you heard it?" Janet sneered, her voice dripping with venom. "It doesn't matter if I manipulated things or not. Sam will always put me first. He'll always leave you behind. In his heart, I'll always be more important than you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="868.html">« Prev</a><a href="870.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
