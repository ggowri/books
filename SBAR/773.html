It was his first encounter with Diana's astonishing prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other man charged in swiftly, but before he could lay a finger on Diana, he was met with a swift kick to the waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an utterly humiliating position, he crumpled to the ground before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a quick step back and casually announced, "No need for such grand gestures, pal. I'm not your elder."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was consumed by a seething fury, yet his waist betrayed him, throbbing with a sharp ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to get up, muttering, "I... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the corridor erupted with chaotic footsteps, and Diana's gaze snapped towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There stood Steven. His tall figure filled the doorway. His physique was such a living testament to the golden ratio that he stood out. No matter where he went, he invariably drew attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several bodyguards loomed behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in surprise and narrowed in anger as she confronted Steven. "Did you send these two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. "What are you implying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the one who hired these gigolos?" Diana was furious as she kicked the man at her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" The man gasped. His ribs howled in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the man, Diana stormed out and stared at Steven. Her words poured out like venom in a scathing tirade. "Steven, you just can't stand me, can you? I came here to unwind, and you send these sickos to humiliate me. What's your game? I said I'd leave you alone, but you won't let me go, even using my brother to threaten me. I agreed to all your terms, so why are you still doing this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was momentarily speechless but finally grasped the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at the two men on the ground and yelled with a mix of frustration and anger, "Are you saying I hired these two to violate you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it obvious? Queenie was followed once, and she said I hired someone to tail her. That night, you called two men over, and you saw how they treated me. You just watched as those bastards beat me up, all to protect your precious Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never asked anyone to bully Queenie. I'm not as shameless as you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you make me sick. Do you want me to die again before you'll let me go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her anger was boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Queenie, Steven would go to any lengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes welled up with tears in an instant. She hadn't wanted to cry, truly, but every time she found herself cornered or belittled, the tears came unbidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I explained to you countless times why I hired someone to follow Queenie. You accused me of jealousy and of making baseless assumptions about your relationship with her. Yet, you two were doing the most disgusting things lovers do, and you had the audacity to claim innocence in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you're the most revolting man I've ever known. Take your dogs and get out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her fury, Diana blurted out without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her, whose desperation and collapse were evident, and opened his mouth to explain. But he thought better of it, realizing that no explanation would suffice; Diana would never believe him again, just as she hadn't then.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And today, Queenie fainted and was rushed to the hospital. Did I cause that? To get back at me, you sent these men to insult me. You're all so quick to blame me for your own mistakes. Do I look like an easy target to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I didn't. I don't know these men at all," Steven finally spoke up in his defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, every time Queenie was in trouble, he found a way to get Diana in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was another day where Queenie found herself entangled in trouble once again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="772.html">« Prev</a><a href="774.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
