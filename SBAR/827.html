The result was not what she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like she had won, but in fact, she had lost miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was calm. "Queenie, if you make a mistake, you lose the whole game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie lost, but she was unwilling to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I didn't lose," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never admit that she lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head and cried, arguing loudly, "Dad, I will not lose. I will never lose, you know? All I did was to make our family live happily. As long as we are happy, we win. But what did you do? You each have your own lover and embarrass me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at the two and felt so angry. She had given her all for this family, but in the end, she failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she came back to this house, she felt cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never felt warmth from the couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie did all these just to be herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood now and regretted it, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked ferocious. However, Jeff looked at her at the moment without any emotion and would no longer comfort her like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled with hate. "Queenie, I don't want this either. It was Amelie who cheated first. We tried our best to make her happy, but she doesn't seem to need it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was stunned and looked at Jeff. "Jeff, are you trying to alienate the relationship between us? I need it. I did this for your own good. I did this so that you can have more cooperation. I am also thinking about this family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Queenie fiercely. "Can't you see my efforts? Queenie, I just got you a cooperation yesterday, and you can make tens of millions of dollars. If I didn't know Mark, you wouldn't get that chance. I tried my best to help you make money, but you treat me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was also very angry. She had a bad reputation now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula exposed her, and Lily also exposed her. Amelie didn't know what she was going to do with her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wanted to say that she could be very successful without Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was very angry and didn't want to say anything. She picked up the bag on the table and said, "I'm leaving first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to stay in such a home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christmas was coming. Queenie had a competition with Diana. She wanted to beat Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana returned to the office. Luna said, "Queenie is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was quite surprised. In such weather, why would Queenie go out instead of staying at home?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Let her come up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Queenie pushed the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat on the sofa, drinking coffee, watching Queenie coming. Queenie's eyes were red, probably because she had been crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was unwilling to give in, so before going to the company, she came to Diana specifically, just to scold Diana to vent her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat down opposite Diana angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Queenie. Queenie's skin was good, and her figure wrapped in the coat was still graceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you just had a miscarriage. Why are you out in this weather? If you continue like this, I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to get pregnant in the future."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="826.html">« Prev</a><a href="828.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
