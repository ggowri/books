I</span><span>'</span><span>m used to this pace of work. It</span><span>'</span><span>s just that sometimes I get frustrated and don</span><span>'</span><span>t feel like going to work."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sighed, "Steven, I hate being stuck in the office. I hate numbers. I hate computers. Right now, I even hate myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana slumped against the couch, trying to justify her exhaustion. She felt both drained and unwell today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She closed her eyes, feeling miserable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was in a bad mood today&mdash;irritable, unwell, and on edge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her weary expression and said softly, "Diana, I hate all this even more than you do. But sometimes, we have to do what we hate. If you don</span><span>'</span><span>t want to come to the office, don</span><span>'</span><span>t. Stay home, rest, do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at his gentle expression and smiled. "It</span><span>'</span><span>s just temporary. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be fine in a few minutes. I think it</span><span>'</span><span>s just that time of the month making me so irritable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned slightly, looking at her. "That time of the month?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He</span><span>'</span><span>d occasionally heard the female employees at the company mention it. But he never really understood what "that time of the month" meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, he heard Evan explain that women have a few days every month called their "time of the month."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven asked, "Are you feeling unwell anywhere? If you</span><span>'</span><span>re not feeling okay, we can go to the hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him and felt a twinge of regret for what she had just said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m just a bit tired and irritable. I think I have a slight headache."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her mention a headache, Steven grew worried she might be sick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weather</span><span>'</span><span>s been chilly lately, and a lot of people have caught colds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled her into his arms and whispered, "Diana, let</span><span>'</span><span>s go home. The work here is almost done."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining work, he could handle from home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "You go check the reports first. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll rest on the couch for a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She truly felt unwell. Maybe a nap would make her feel better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t let her lie on the couch. Instead, he scooped her up in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana opened her eyes, eyeing him warily. "What are you doing?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven met her wary gaze and explained, "Diana, you won't be comfortable sleeping here. I'll take you to the lounge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a breath of relief. Even she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t sure what she was so guarded about.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back when she and Steven shared a bed, he hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t done anything to her either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana figured it was probably the fact that they were in the office that made her feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Steven clearly had no desire for her at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana realized she had misunderstood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So sleepy," Diana murmured, leaning into Steven's arms and drifting off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her, feeling a pang of envy. He often struggled with insomnia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slowed his steps, gazing at her peaceful, sleeping face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt a surge of excitement. He had waited far too long. The possessiveness he felt for her was undeniable&mdash;he wanted to keep her by his side forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the lounge, he gently laid Diana on the soft bed, tucked her in, and brushed a tender kiss across her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stirred uneasily, shaking her head slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven straightened up with a smile. Knowing Diana was deeply asleep, he brushed his fingers lightly over her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I can't wait any longer. What am I going to do with you?" he murmured softly. He had been waiting so long for the day he could finally call himself her man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood by the bed for a long moment before stepping out to bring his laptop into the lounge. The occasional sounds he made didn</span><span>'</span><span>t disturb her peaceful sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was the soundest sleeper he had ever known.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven worked from the couch, occasionally glancing at Diana lying peacefully on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a smile, he sent off his final email, closed all the programs, picked up his phone, and opened the browser. He typed in: "First time for women."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven read intently, his eyes scanning the overwhelming flood of information on the page.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The search results flooded with topics: "How painful is a woman's first time?" "What to do if there's bleeding?" "Pain sensitivity varies for girls," "Differences in hymen thickness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man must be gentle, patient, and never rough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven jotted down the key points, then set his phone aside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat near the window, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven hesitated for a moment, then searched</span><span>,</span><span> "Tips for a man's first time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven figured this was something he had to experience for himself; you couldn't trust everything online.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He closed the search bar, resolving to focus on foreplay and stay calm when the time came.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took a deep breath, glanced at his computer, and tried to steady himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His heart was racing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Diana, peacefully asleep on the bed. Smiling, he walked over, lay down beside her, and wrapped her in his arms to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But holding Diana, Steven couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t fall asleep at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He opened his eyes and looked at her. She was sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven envied her peaceful sleep. He often struggled with insomnia, dark circles under his eyes, and a constant sense of exhaustion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gazed at Diana with deep affection, a soft smile on his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding her, he felt truly happy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the years, Steven's family treated him well, but he always felt incomplete without Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven closed his eyes gently. Sleep was finally calling him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Diana opened her eyes, the sky was already dark. Even after a nap, her mind felt foggy. She knew she was sick. Oddly enough, she hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t fallen ill in winter, but now, in spring, she had.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the warmth behind her, she turned slightly and saw Steven's handsome face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out Steven was lying beside her, making her sleep more peacefully. But the sickness still weighed on her, leaving her uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She reached out, gently nudging Steven. "Steven, wake up," she murmured. "I don't feel well."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1126.html">« Prev</a><a href="1128.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
