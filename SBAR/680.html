He loves Queenie to death. Why doesn't he divorce you?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wants to enjoy the best of both worlds. Why doesn't he go to heaven? He can be scared to death in his dreams."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless. She thought, "Wasn't he the one who was frightened by the dream?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was angry. He thought, "They are chatting. Why am I implicated for no reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was vindictive. "Cecil, if you say something nonsense again, I'll cancel the cooperation with the Farley family."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, Diana. That idiot is right next to you? Why didn't you tell me earlier? It's so embarrassing to be caught speaking ill of others."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wanted to say that it was none of her business.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cecil said, "Bye, Diana. I'll meet you for dinner tonight. Remember what you said about stocks. Diana, take me with you to make more money."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana had time to refuse, Cecil hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face was gloomy, and he warned Diana, "Don't associate with him. He is not a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pressed her lips, thinking, "Steven, you are not a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked him to eat quickly. She had to go to the company soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her anxiety, Steven said, "Why don't you come to my company to work? I'll tell Mr. Watson. Our two companies have a cooperation. You are my wife, and you can be the chief designer in the design department. Our company is still short of a chief designer."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't. I'm already entangled with you. If I go to work in your company, it will be even more entangled. I have a good job now. I don't want to be disturbed."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven did not force her. Her company was just opposite his. If he wanted to see her, he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven drank a plate of pumpkin soup. It was the taste he had been craving for. Steven smiled. He liked it. The pumpkin was delicious and soft. He didn't like crispy pumpkin.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his smile, Diana was a bit stunned. She thought, "He had smiled like this when I took care of him in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all wishful thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the years I was with Steven, I kept pleasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would make elaborate decorations for various festivals. But Steven was unwilling to even take a second look at my painstaking efforts."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fell into deep thought. Even her movement of drinking soup slowed down a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had to go back to the company after lunch. He asked, "Do you want to go back to the company together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No. Luna will pick me up."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't force it. "Well! Then I'll go to the company first."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had an important meeting at two o'clock in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at his hand. After a month, his wound should have healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her and found that she did not look up at him. In the past, when he had gone out to work, Diana would send him to the door and tell him to be careful on the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he had just thought Diana was good at pretending. But now, he understood that was her only true heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she didn't want him anymore. So, there was no need for her to send him off to work with such affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were gloomy. Suppressing the possessive desire in his heart, he said, "I'm going to work."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana then looked up at his cold and handsome face. "Okay! Be careful on the road!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana was stunned. It was a pet phrase.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven smiled. He walked to the sofa and picked up his wool coat. Then, he left in a good mood.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="679.html">« Prev</a><a href="681.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
