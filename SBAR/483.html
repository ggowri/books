"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chef had prepared the lobster and saved it for Diana as supper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pointed to the electric steamer and said, "Plug it in and put the lobster in the steamer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven saw that the lobster was processed, so he placed the lobster in the steamer according to Diana's instructions. Diana pressed the switch, and the steamer worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was surprised, thinking, "Is cooking so easy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been nearly a year since Diana left, and Steven rarely came into the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't live there, and that home was quiet and cold. Steven didn't want to go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa was not too big, but it felt very empty to Steven. When Diana lived there, he always felt that home was very warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew that Diana's misunderstanding of him would probably never be cleared in this life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood by the pot without paying attention to Steven. As the water boiled, she put the cabbage in, then sat on a seat nearby and waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the light, her skin looked soft. Steven looked at her and couldn't help but think, "Did she cook in the kitchen like this every night back then and wait for me to return?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It turned out that she carefully prepared all the dinners I had eaten before, but I had never cared about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I even thought she was useless except for cooking.</span><span> </span><span>But in fact, she works harder than anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Diana quietly. When Diana was silent, she seemed to be surrounded by the beauty of peace. Her posture was elegant, and this scene was like a painting. For a while, Steven didn't bear to disturb her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat there and leaned against the wall. She was exhausted and soon felt sleepy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew that she was tired, so he just stood by her quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his way here, he saw that car. Samuel was very arrogant, and there was intense murderous intent in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, Diana suddenly stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned off the heat and asked Steven to scoop the cabbage out of the pot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said calmly, "There's a bowl below. Scoop the cabbage in it. The lobster still needs to be steamed for five minutes, and the soup needs to wait for 15 minutes. Eat these two first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to rest. You can go back after eating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven just nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana left the kitchen and went upstairs to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her go upstairs before returning to the kitchen to wait for the soup. He hadn't had the soup she cooked for a long time, and he could have a full meal tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was injured, and Steven shouldn't have asked her to cook dinner, but he missed the taste of her cooking so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went upstairs and lay on the bed without even washing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she closed her eyes, her phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked it up and opened her eyes tiredly. Seeing that it was an unknown number, she didn't answer it and put the phone back on the bedside table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the phone kept vibrating, which annoyed her so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the phone rang for the third time, Diana answered it, "Hello?" Her voice was a little irritable and impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula asked anxiously, "Diana, are you okay? I saw you had a car accident..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana interrupted Paula helplessly, "Madam, I have nothing to do with you anymore. Whether I live or die is none of your business. I'm tired. If you have nothing important, please don't disturb me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula said, "Diana, I just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cut her off again, "Madam, you're not my mother. You gave birth to me, but I paid back everything I owed. I don't owe you anything now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="482.html">« Prev</a><a href="484.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
