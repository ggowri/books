"Well, that depends on how you answer my question. If you can explain how Frank ended up in that situation, and tell me the truth about what happened, I'll agree to remarry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone can make empty promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Paula had been capable of doing such things even to her daughter&mdash;so what was stopping her from manipulating someone like Jeff, a man she deemed a scoundrel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could easily break her word and go back on any commitment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff hurriedly spoke, his voice trembling, "It was Queenie who sent Frank to follow Elsie. He hid on the boat and overheard everything&mdash;Elsie and her boyfriend's scheme. He found out that Elsie was planted by Queenie to seduce him. In a panic, Frank tried to kill Elsie, but then he was stabbed in the thigh by a steel pipe. He fell into the sea, and that's where he drowned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in Jeff's voice was palpable&mdash;Frank was his flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Jeff had always held onto the belief that his son hadn't truly died, since no one had ever seen his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deserved to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he have been so blind, working alongside that cruel daughter to plot the death of a son who had cared for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula shut her eyes, inhaling deeply. So, that was how Frank had met his end. If it hadn't been for the lucky chance of Diana diving for fish, he would've truly died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The depth of the manipulation was clearer than ever. She hadn't seen it before&mdash;had nearly become an accomplice in this twisted scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I have been so foolish?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie screamed in utter desperation, her voice full of fury. "Jeff, you're inhuman! You're a selfish, vile piece of garbage. Queenie is your daughter&mdash;how could you betray her like this? You were the one who colluded with her to scheme against your four sons in the first place! Why are you pushing all the blame onto her? Paula only wants to take the evidence you hold over her head! And you&mdash;you sold out your flesh and blood for your selfish gain. Jeff, a man like you doesn't deserve happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed a trembling finger at him, her voice rising with a finality. "You belong in hell, and you don't deserve to be human again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Paula's eyes shot open, her gaze sharp and calculating, looking down at Jeff, who was slumped there like a broken heap, powerless and pitiful. "Alright," she said sharply. "Let me ask you one more thing. How did Gale end up like that? How did he lose the use of his legs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divorce papers were in her hand, and with a calculating smile, she continued, "If you tell me, I'll remarry you. At the very least, you owe it to your sons to let them know the truth&mdash;let them know how their piece-of-shit father harmed them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff hastily answered, his voice weak and defeated, "It was Queenie's doing. She had someone tamper with Gale's car. During the race, the car flipped, and Gale's legs were crushed. But there's no turning back now. The man who did it is willing to take the fall for Queenie. Even if he came forward now and pointed at her, there was no evidence to back it up. His word alone can't prove anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula knew the truth&mdash;all the evidence had been destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was finally laid bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard it all with her ears, yet the pain still consumed her. But there she was, torturing herself, desperate to hear more from Jeff's lips, to understand just how vile he truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was on the verge of breaking down. At this point, Queenie was all she had left. She couldn't let these two disgusting people ruin her daughter's future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both had to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's eyes locked onto the fruit knife on the table. Her gaze hardened as she reached for it without hesitation, then lunged at Jeff's chest with a swift, forceful strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing by, Paula had been prepared. The moment she saw Amelie move, she kicked her leg out, knocking Amelie off balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie cried out in pain as the knife slipped from her grip and clattered to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In disbelief, she looked at Paula, her voice a mixture of confusion and fury. "Paula, he's done this to you. I'm helping you by killing him&mdash;why are you stopping me? Why? He's nothing but a bastard, he doesn't love anyone but himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face twisted with anguish and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Jeff, the one most terrified of death&mdash;he was trembling, his chest rising and falling rapidly with every shallow breath. He couldn't help but feel a rush of relief that he had narrowly escaped death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked at her with a cruel smile. "You're wrong. While I might have wished for his death, what I want is to see him suffer in hell. All the poison you once gave me will now come back to bite him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His body's already been tainted by toxins. Soon enough, he'll become a shell of himself, unable even to take his own life. What I'm doing is returning the favor, giving him a taste of his own medicine. I can't turn him into a madman, but I can make sure he lives a life worse than death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was casual, but her words hit Jeff like a cold wave of shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Jeff's eyes locked onto Paula's face, and for the first time, he understood something&mdash;Paula hadn't come here today to remarry him. No, she was here to push him into hell, ensuring he'd never get up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life was over. Destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula... how did you find out I poisoned your soup?" he asked, the weight of realization finally sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always wondered where things had gone wrong, why he had lost so utterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula let out a cold laugh, her expression twisted with sadness. "From the moment you insisted on feeding me soup every day, I knew you were cheating. So, I had the soup tested. That's when I found out it was laced with a mild poison. If I kept drinking it, I'd start losing my mind. Eventually, you and your little schemes would have me sent to an asylum, looking like a madwoman. While everyone believed I was crazy, you would quietly take out my four sons and daughter, then you'd have everything&mdash;the Barnes family name, all of it&mdash;legally yours for the taking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word Paula spoke sent a violent tremor through Jeff's body, a deep, uncontrollable shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she knew everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted in a grotesque expression, each word coming through gritted teeth. "Paula, so you've used the same method against me? You poisoned me, just like I did to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When had he taken the poison? Why hadn't he noticed it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula laughed, a sound filled with dark satisfaction. "Exactly. Do you remember that time when you were out of sorts, hallucinating, unable to focus? That was me. I made sure you saw things that weren't there. Only when your mind was far from me could I act quickly&mdash;transferring all my assets, shorting my company, racking up over a billion dollars in debt. Without that debt, do you think you'd have been able to divorce me so easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula smiled as she delivered the final blow. "This entire mess? It was all part of my plan. Everything was arranged by me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff glared at her, seeing the victorious expression on her face, and a seething hatred boiled inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists were clenched so tightly that if he had nails, his palms would be bloodied and torn by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you're shameless!" Jeff shouted, his voice trembling with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest tightened, pain starting to spread across his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula bent slightly, her posture regal, her face lit up with a smile that was both charming and cold. Her makeup was flawless, her presence dripping with elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke, her voice light, but every word cutting, "Jeff, how exactly am I shameless? Let me tell you, this is my real retaliation. What I've done to you doesn't even compare to a fraction of what you've done to me. Why should I take everything you've done to me, yet when I do the same to you, it's suddenly too much for you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1008.html">« Prev</a><a href="1010.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
