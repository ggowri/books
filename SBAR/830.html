"What? What does it have to do with me? I'm not your breadwinner. Do I have to support you for the rest of my life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold words were like a knife stabbing into Queenie's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Steven, I love you so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You don't deserve it! You just had a miscarriage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's words made Queenie feel ashamed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Also, I know about you hiring someone to threaten Diana. Queenie, why did you become so malicious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he never had a deep understanding of Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was because Steven didn't care about Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't bother to get to know her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just wanted to know everything Diana liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "I... I didn't, Steven. It's because you broke your word that I became like this. It's because you..." It was because he didn't want to sleep with her that she found other men. Levi was very handsome and had good skills. She couldn't resist the temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Queenie saw Diana inside, she stopped. Queenie absolutely could not let Diana know that Steven had not slept with her. Otherwise, Diana would definitely find out something from the photos Queenie had sent her before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "Queenie, I have investigated the truth of the fire that year. You and your father were there on purpose that day. You said you saved me. Now try to carry me on your back. Can you carry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie trembled and looked at him. "You... What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "I will continue to investigate. It was a murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That fire didn't kill me, but I got into a serious car accident later. I have been investigating this serial murder case."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had a frightened look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Why is he suddenly investigating this matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is he doubting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled. "Steven, they were accidents. Why do you think they were not accidents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said, "I suddenly realized that they were not accidents, but a murder against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at her nervous face lightly and became more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie finally fled in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched her really leave and then looked at Steven's angry face. She thought, "Was he really not acting?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. He is not worthy of my trust."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She once trusted Steven but was fooled by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Tsk! You two are great. You really put in all your efforts in acting together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Diana's mocking face. "You said I was acting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Yes, didn't you act with her before and lied to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath and felt the pain. He didn't know what she was referring to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her seriously and explained, "No. Diana, I am not acting, and I have no intention of deceiving you. When I was in the hotel, I have told you everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven walked in and looked at her office, which was quite warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Nolan treats you like this? The office is so small. After all, you are the chief designer here, and you should have a bigger office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Our company is just a small one. There is no need to waste resources. It's good here. I like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat opposite him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled. "Why are you so far away from me? I can't see you clearly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was angry. "There's something wrong with your eyes."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="829.html">« Prev</a><a href="831.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
