If his father went too far, he could end up in jail.</p><p>Andrew was notoriously known as a playboy, with many illegitimate children outside.</p><p>To prevent the illegitimate children from coming back to claim the inheritance, His father directly gave all his assets to Steven, whom he and his wife had raised since childhood.</p><p>Although Andrew was a scoundrel, he still respected his father and wouldn&#x27;t let his illegitimate children cause trouble in front of his grandparents. On the surface, Steven was the only grandson.</p><p>There were too many stories about Steven, including where his mother ultimately went, which no one knew.</p><p>&quot;Cecil, why don&#x27;t we be a bit more polite to him？ As you said, he is ruthless and scheming. What if he has us dealt with in some underhanded way? We wouldn&#x27;t be able to guard against that.&quot;</p><p>Her father warned her not to provoke Steven, no matter how much she hated it, she had to endure.</p><p>Paige&#x27;s family was quite good, but it still couldn&#x27;t compare to the Gellar family.</p><p>The Farley family was on par with the Gellar family in terms of power, but Cecil lacked the ruthlessness of Steven.</p><p>Cecil was shaking with rage. &quot;Why should we give in to a scumbag? He made Diana so miserable in the past. I have to settle it down.&quot;</p><p>There was a flame of anger burning in his eyes.</p><p>Paige couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at his attempt to put on a brave face, &quot;Alright, I&#x27;ll see what you&#x27;re going to do.&quot;</p><p>Cecil rolled his eyes at her flinch.</p><p>After Steven&#x27;s boat docked, bodyguards escorted him as he walked down with an elegant gait.</p><p>Steven looked at Cecil and asked coldly, &quot;Where is Diana?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Cecil went to get his fishing gear, preparing to go fishing. He was determined to catch a lot of fish all day today.</p><p>Steven looked at Cecil without speaking, and didn&#x27;t say anything more.</p><p>Evan came down with his fishing gear, looking at the vast blue sea. It had been a long time since he felt this relaxed.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Gellar, the beauty here is simply too healing,&quot; he said.</p><p>Steven also took a deep breath. He removed his sunglasses just in time to see Diana emerge from underwater.</p><p>In her net, there were six more large lobsters.</p><p>She swam hard towards the shore.</p><p>&quot;Cecil, come over here quickly. The resources here are great. I caught six lobsters, a whole bunch, and they&#x27;re really big. I absolutely love this kind of lobster.&quot;</p><p>Cecil, carrying a bucket, rushed into the sea with a smile and placed the lobsters that Diana had caught into the bucket.</p><p>Cecil, seeing that each lobster weighed over a pound, was so excited that he didn&#x27;t know what to do.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen such fresh large lobsters.</p><p>&quot;Diana, you&#x27;re really amazing.&quot; He decided to learn diving so that he could go underwater fishing with Diana in the future.</p><p>Diana smiled, then suddenly looked up and saw Steven standing on the shore; she was slightly taken aback.</p><p>Cecil also knew why she was surprised. He turned to look at Steven, unhappily saying, &quot;Diana, I didn&#x27;t know he would come either.&quot;</p><p>Diana asked, &quot;Is Queenie here? If she&#x27;s here, we should go somewhere else. After all, she wants to kill you.&quot;</p><p>Cecil said nervously, &quot;No, I haven&#x27;t seen her.&quot;</p><p>Diana breathed a sigh of relief. She was also afraid of that heartless and vicious woman.</p><p>She pointed at the lobsters and said, &quot;Put these lobsters in the fridge to keep them fresh, and have your chef prepare them for dinner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I saw a ray, but it was too big. I didn&#x27;t dare to catch it for fear of being dragged into the sea. But I spotted some coral trout. I&#x27;ll go catch a few; we can have steamed fish for dinner,&quot; she added.</p><p>Cecil said excitedly, &quot;Great, Diana, thank you so much. I will have the chef I brought with me prepare the most delicious seafood for you.&quot;</p><p>Diana smiled, then turned and dove back into the water.</p><p>The water was very clear, and they could see where Diana had dived in.</p><p>Steven changed into his swimming trunks and also went into the sea.</p><p>The wound on his arm was exposed, and he narrowed his eyes and looked at Diana with a smile.</p><p>Cecil looked at Steven and asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p><p>Steven said indifferently, &quot;I want to swim.&quot;</p><p>Cecil pointed at his injured arm, &quot;Steven, you&#x27;re injured. What do you plan to do by going in? Attract sharks? &quot;Diana is having a good time now. Don&#x27;t you go in and disturb her. You&#x27;re such a bad person.&quot;</p><p>Steven frowned.</p><p>Cecil looked around the boat, and asked vigilantly, &quot;Steven, did Queenie come as well?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="405.html">« Prev</a><a href="407.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
