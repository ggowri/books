How did Paula get the videos?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No! She must prevent Jeff from watching the videos. If he knew that she cheated on him, she would meet her doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was quite stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, they just got married 10 days ago. She finally became his wife, something she had been waiting for all her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, what are you doing? You are simply trying to slander me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie did not grab Paula's phone because Paula was on her guard and moved it slightly.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie couldn't stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff, however, had watched videos of Mark and Amelie making love, of them fondling and feeding each other in a private room, and of them entering and leaving hotels and clubs.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The videos annoyed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Amelie had betrayed him a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How dare she? He had been cautious all these years to provide for her and their son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was very anxious. She shook her head and said, "Jeff, don't watch the videos. Close your eyes. These videos are all synthesized. Paula is trying to smear me. I have never betrayed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula chucked, "So, you have been together for a long time, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was stunned and didn't dare to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She came to Jeff for lunch outside. It was snowing heavily, and she really didn't want to cook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing him, she noticed that he was absent-minded. She asked him and found out that Paula had come here to find Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff and Paula were finally divorced. Amelie had been a mistress all these years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she was determined to show off in front of Paula and vent her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could say anything, Paula's videos caught her off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie glared at the arrogant Paula. Her hatred was like a blunt knife, slicing her heart and causing her to tremble slightly in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Paula was dressed in a very ordinary, soft down jacket, her innate nobility and elegance couldn't be concealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's jealousy turned into pride. "Yes, we have been together for a long time. Paula, you are an idiot, a total idiot. We will live happily together in the future. However, you are penniless and will only live in that old small house until your death. Paula, I won."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grinned haughtily, but she was not confident, for her victory was not glorious.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was displeased that she didn't get everything that Paula had or the building she had always dreamed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula put away her phone and taunted Jeff. "Jeff, since I married you, I've had five children for you. It was because I loved you, but how did you treat me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually have a mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, you have no conscience. Many members of the Marsh family have become rich and well off, thanks to me. I supported your relatives when they built their villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was sincere to you, but you left me with nothing and then ruthlessly abandoned me and our four children. Jeff, I really misjudged you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's heart had gone numb, but when she brought up the past, it still hurt.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="613.html">« Prev</a><a href="615.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
