They'd have to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix watched her stubborn silence with patience. He pulled out a chair, sitting down with a casual air, and crossed his legs. "Fine, don't say a word. It doesn't matter. We'll track down the location of the phone numbers in your phone. They're somewhere off the coast, not far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and your crew aren't slipping through our fingers this time. And if I'm not mistaken, you were behind those other kidnappings too. If we tie you to those... death penalty. No question about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was flat, but the weight of his words hit hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel felt a jolt of fear, but she quickly masked it. She was a veteran at this. She knew how to handle the heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope, on the other hand, was crumbling beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope screamed, her voice shaking, "Ahhh! Aunt Rachel, I don't wanna die! Please, save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "The baby in my belly is the heir to the Marsh family. I can't afford to be locked up. I just can't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Just shut your mouth!" Rachel snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I'm not saying a word. As long as they don't dig up the past, they'll only have this one charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few years at most. If they uncover everything else... Well, I'll throw my boyfriend under the bus. Let him take the fall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix wasn't expecting Rachel to talk. He'd already given orders to speed up the investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every cop on the island was out searching. Time was of the essence. Luck was on their side. The child was found before dawn, barely alive, burning up with fever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby's skin had turned a sickening shade of purple from the cold. Emergency services rushed the infant to the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was just making breakfast when she overheard the nurses talking. Relief washed over her when she heard the child was found safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As fate would have it, she ran into Penelope and Rachel just as they were being escorted to the police cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope, wild-eyed and desperate, caught sight of Diana. "Diana! Help me! Please, help me, you little bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope had always thought Diana was a fool&mdash;gullible and easily manipulated by Queenie. But now, she'd sell her soul to get out of this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Diana marched up and slapped Penelope across the face hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!" Penelope's scream echoed, blood pooling in her mouth from where she bit her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope spat, blood mixing with her words. "You... you hit me? I'm your brother's future wife, you moron! You think you can get away with this? I'll have Gale beat you to a pulp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes narrowed. "Go ahead. Call him. See if he'll lift a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and by the way, I've got the evidence from what you did to Althea at the hotel last time. I'll make sure it gets to the police. That ought to keep you behind bars for a nice, long stay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope's face went white. "What... what evidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't you dare mess with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smirked coldly and turned away, not bothering to respond further. She headed toward Althea's house, leaving Penelope trembling in her wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope thought, "How did this happen? I was sure 408 was Althea's room that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How the hell did it turn into the police chief's wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana! Did you set me up? Answer me!" Penelope screamed, her voice cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana was already gone, disappearing into the wind and snow. Penelope's shouts were swallowed by the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the police station, Penelope wasted no time. She made a frantic call to Gale, begging him to pull strings.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="567.html">« Prev</a><a href="569.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
