I've left you, so why won't you just let me go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only ever loved you. Why are you treating me like this? I married you and saved you, but you show no gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've already paid back the medical bills from back then, so we're even. It's time we got divorced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was seething, her anger reaching its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in her eyes, threatening to spill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's hands clenched slightly at his sides as he watched her eyes fill with tears. "I've already said it before. I was wrong back then. I'm apologizing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a bitter laugh. "And I've told you, your apologies mean nothing to me. You don't even deserve to apologize!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will never forgive you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned and headed downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned as he watched her walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Daren saw Steven, his brows furrowed. "Ms. Bishop, why is he here again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked towards the dining room, a cold smile on her lips. "He climbed over the wall. Tonight, please make sure the security team is on duty around the clock. If there's anything unusual, I want to be notified immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if this man is ever seen climbing over again, call the police right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren glanced over at Steven and said, "Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven chuckled. "Diana, do you think that's going to make me go away? Don't forget, we still have a business arrangement. I signed a three-year contract with you. You're my wife, so me coming over isn't exactly against the law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned back, shocked. "Steven, are you messing with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's smile was sly. "Diana, you're talented, but in the business world, the biggest trap is often hidden in a contract. A deal that seems perfect can conceal endless pitfalls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze. She hadn't expected Steven to trap her once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven interrupted her with a grin, "Diana, you only have two options. Either break your contract with Nolan and become the design director for my company, or pay me the penalty fee. Oh, by the way, it's three hundred million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you're shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at him. Her designs had been stolen, and she had sold her drafts to him in a desperate bid to escape Steven. She never thought he'd lay a trap within that contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe you. I'm going to check at the company. I won't fall for your tricks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat down at the dining table, lowering her head to eat her sandwich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Daren had quietly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Steven and Diana remained in the dining room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had always been fond of sandwiches. Diana used to make them for him, and they were delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana savored her food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven also enjoyed his sandwich. The two of them ate breakfast in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few bites, Diana glanced across the table at Steven. She couldn't believe that after everything that had happened, he could still sit there so calmly and eat breakfast with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought his shamelessness knew no bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized she had been outmaneuvered by Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she finished her breakfast, she messaged Luna, asking her to review the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Luna replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Ms. Bishop, that's exactly how the contract is worded. Didn't you read it carefully at the time? Ms. Bishop, you sold yourself out.]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="600.html">« Prev</a><a href="602.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
