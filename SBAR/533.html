Did your father use his power to force Ms. Bishop to reconcile?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It angered Samuel, and his eyes turned red with anger. "Get lost! Is it related to you?? Get away from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several other reporters also rushed over to broadcast the live broadcast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's arrogant attitude was important news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Samuel Farley, why do you have to kill Diana? How did she do anything wrong to you that makes you speak so arrogantly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the reporters, and a stern look flashed across his eyes. "Get lost. It has nothing to do with you. The hatred between me and that woman is not something you can understand. Get lost! Don't force me to hit you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Samuel Farley, for rich people like you, is it easy to kill an ordinary person? How dare you be so arrogant?" a female reporter asked loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's eyes turned red with anger. He looked at the female reporter with bloodthirsty eyes very arrogantly. "That's right! Rich people can kill someone at will. If you ask again, be careful or I'll kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his words, "That's right! Rich people can kill someone at will," exploded on the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People on the Internet were scolding Samuel for being arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Samuel is too arrogant. Check if he has any murder cases on hand.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[He is so arrogant in front of the police station. I don't know how many people have been bullied by him in normal times.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt is not a good person. His building used materials that did not meet the regulations, and he did not care about the safety of the people. Samuel also had an arrogant character and did not care about human lives at will, which was extremely hateful.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Samuel came out, he was on top search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt hadn't resolved the property issue yet, but he was admitted to the hospital because of Samuel's arrogant top searches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, Wyatt's company's stock price plummeted, and the entire nation boycotted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous buyers of the houses wanted to cancel their purchases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Seeing the stupid Samuel, Queenie was so angry that she smashed the computer in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot, idiot, how can there be such an idiot in this world? He is so stupid. Does he have cerebellar atrophy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Artificial intelligence can't beat a natural fool like him. It really makes me angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was so angry that she lost control and yelled in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk! Queenie, if the media knew about your crazy side, you would be the top search."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, who was furious, suddenly heard Diana's invested voice, and she looked toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was standing at the door. It was snowing outside. She was wearing a pink coat and had long hair draped over her shoulders. Diana looked pure and lovely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was slightly shocked that Diana would come here. "Diana, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana leaned against the door, looked at her embarrassed and ferocious face, and smiled faintly, "I heard that Mrs. Marsh's company went bankrupt, and she was preparing to sell it. You also opened a studio to make a living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have taken over my life for more than 20 years, and now you will have to live without money..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually just wanted to see the scene where Queenie lost her composure just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, Diana. You idiot, you know nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Queenie just found it funny. Was Diana here to mock her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I know you want your parents' love, but your brothers and parents are unwilling to love you. You are obviously their biological daughter, but they are unwilling to acknowledge that you are their biological daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This feeling must make you painful, Diana. There will be even more pain waiting for you next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her facial features were ferocious, and she thought, "Why doesn't Diana die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled and shook her head, "Tsk! I have never seen such a shameless person! Your neck is so cute, with a stupid head on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana finished speaking, she left in a leisurely manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Queenie, who was already angry, went crazy after hearing her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Damn Diana, she actually said that I had a stupid head on my neck!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="532.html">« Prev</a><a href="534.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
