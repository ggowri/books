In her mind, Eric was already a useless waste of space, so there was no harm in telling him the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, the time you suddenly fainted and had a fever, it was actually Grandma who poisoned you. She saw you becoming more and more capable, so she started to suppress you. If all of you were capable, how could our family be reunited? Oh, and Dad was also in on it. He had you all play racing games together, and didn't want you to get involved in the company's affairs. He didn't want you to learn about economics and management. Do you understand now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's eyes were filled with hatred. He truly felt like he was dying during those three days and nights.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had been by his side the whole time, carefully feeding him that rusty-tasting antidote every day. He still complained, annoyed with Diana for fussing over him, making him swallow such awful medicine. But Diana would just smile and say, "Eric, you have to take it, no matter how bad it tastes. It's the only thing that can save your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even mocked her, laughing, "Diana, are you sent here to mess with me? It's just a fever, why am I taking an antidote? Are you that eager for me to die? That eager to compete with Queenie for my affection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tears couldn't be stopped then. Annoyed, he told Diana to get lost. In the end, Diana didn't leave until she watched him take the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back now, he realized what a complete ass he'd been.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was the only one who truly cared about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric let out a bitter laugh. "Thanks for telling me all this, Queenie. So you've been plotting to kill all four of us brothers since way back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie placed the milkshake on the table, a cold smirk playing on her lips. "Your whole family is like a bunch of crabs struggling in the mud. Only by cutting off your limbs can I make sure you stay down there forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what did I end up with? I still ended up being treated like some bastard child. If it weren't for Lily and your mother, would I have ended up this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's anger grew with every word. Lily's body was still missing, and she was determined to make that woman pay. But Mark had beaten her to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark had money and power - something Jeff could never match.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was worthless now, utterly useless to her plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Family meant nothing to her. The only thing that mattered was her gain. If someone couldn't help her rise, they were nothing more than a stepping stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie raised an eyebrow and looked at Eric with a glint of mischief in her eyes. Of the four brothers, Eric was the only one with a clear head. However, with Amelie planning to marry Mark, Jeff was now completely useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric," she said, her voice smooth and persuasive, "don't dwell on the past. It was Dad's idea after all. If you're going to blame anyone, blame him. He's the one who didn't want to see you succeed. Eric, he was never a good father. You should be thinking about how to get even with him. I heard he's been pestering Mom these past few days, trying to get back together with her. He's just a gold-digging scumbag. If you want revenge, now's the perfect time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric saw right through her game. She thought Jeff was useless now and wanted to use him to get rid of Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sly smile flickered across Eric's eyes. "Queenie, how can you say that? You've said it yourself before. There's nothing wrong with pursuing your dreams and even less wrong with chasing after love and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you forgotten? When you came back and went to find Steven, you learned he had married Diana. When I advised you to give up, you told me the same thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said, 'Eric, what's wrong with me pursuing my happiness? It was Diana who stole my love.' But Queenie, you left because you saw Steven couldn't walk and was blind. You were afraid to marry a blind man.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's wrong with Jeff going to any lengths for his love?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="719.html">« Prev</a><a href="721.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
