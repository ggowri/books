"Have a seat, Mr. Farley. I'll tell you a story. If you still want to kill me after that, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face twisted in anger. The audacity of her calm demeanor made his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still smiling? You've got some nerve, Diana," he snapped, his tone razor-sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana put on a faint, ironic smile. "Nerve? No, Mr. Farley. It's just a mask, like everyone wears. I've just learned to stay steady under pressure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed, his eyes narrowing. "Well, tonight I'll rip that mask off and let the world see who you really are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her invitation, Samuel took a step closer, his anger palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twice now, this woman had sent him to prison. The thought alone was enough to fuel his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Diana's clear, unflinching gaze didn't waver, as though she were completely unbothered by the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie sent you because you're ruthless," she said evenly. "But let me tell you this&mdash;if you kill me and walk out of here, you're as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about it. Once you're caught, Queenie will sweep in and claim your family's fortune. You've seen the headlines about Jace Foliot today, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel froze mid-step, doubt flickering across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Foliot family's downfall had been the talk of the day. He'd seen it plastered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing his hesitation, Diana pressed forward. "Take a seat, Samuel. Let me explain everything. After that, you can decide if you still want to go through with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His frustration spilled over. "You're just stalling for time!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shrugged lightly, her tone almost casual. "Maybe. But what could I possibly do in my condition? I'm just trying to keep you from being another one of Queenie's pawns."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His response was immediate, defensive. "She's not using me! I'm doing this because I want to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words came too quickly, betraying his own doubts. Deep down, he knew Queenie </span><span>was using him, but his thirst for revenge blinded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice grew colder. "If that's true, then I've got nothing left to say. But mark my words&mdash;once you leave here, Queenie will dismantle your family in three days flat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Samuel landed in prison again, his parents would be left scrambling to clean up his mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Queenie, it would be the perfect opportunity. She had been lying in wait, ready to seize the moment and dismantle the entire Farley family empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie's not like you," he muttered stubbornly. "She's not that bad. You, on the other hand, destroyed the entire Gellar family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana arched an eyebrow, her patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. If you're determined to be a fool, I won't stop you," she said, her voice icy and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's whole body tensed as a dangerous glint lit his eyes. "Stop trying to scare me. I'm not afraid of you. I just want you dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's piercing gaze locked onto Samuel, sharp and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel froze, an unexpected wave of pressure rolling over him, thick and suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in surprise. Why did it feel like this woman was far more dangerous than she seemed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice dropped, turning cold as steel. "Samuel, you're only twenty-four. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life rotting in a prison cell?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first time you went to jail, it was because Queenie manipulated you into acting out. You hit me with your car&mdash;that's on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second time, you tried to attack me again. That's on you, too. But somehow, you keep blaming me for your mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Foliot family collapsed today. How many days do you think your family has left?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face darkened as he shouted, "I don't care! It's your fault I went to prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sighed, exhaling her frustration. "If that's what helps you sleep at night, think whatever you want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was trying to save you, Samuel. You're young. Your parents love you. You could have a bright future ahead of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you're hell-bent on throwing your life away, why should I care?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swinging her legs over the side of the bed, Diana planted her injured foot on the ground. Her voice, low and firm, carried an edge of finality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's hand tightened around the knife he'd drawn, his knuckles white. A bitter smile was on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're dead, Diana, the Gellar and Farley families will finally split the spoils."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled softly, shaking her head. "You're delusional," she said, her tone laced with exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so funny?" Samuel snapped, his composure slipping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm laughing at how stupid you are," she replied bluntly. "Steven couldn't reclaim everything Queenie stole. What makes you think your family can? You, with your short temper? Or your father, who's more interested in booze than business?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Face it, Samuel. If you walk out of here tonight, you'll be arrested on the spot. Queenie's already lined up your cell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit like a hammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to believe it, couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... no way! Queenie wouldn't betray me like that!" he stammered, his voice cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tone softened slightly, but her words stayed razor-sharp. "Call Jace Foliot, who's in the hospital now. Ask him how his family fell apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care! In this world, it's survival of the fittest. If he couldn't hold onto his empire, that's on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't respond, simply watching him with an unwavering gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel hesitated, unnerved by her silence. "Why aren't you arguing anymore, Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That pushed Diana to the verge of laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're not worth it," she said flatly. "When I tried reasoning with you, you ignored me. Now, when I stay silent, you accuse me of giving up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're going to kill me, just do it. I'm injured&mdash;I can't run. Come over here and stab me in the heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was steady, her eyes unflinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer intensity of her presence made Samuel falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to her chest, where she pointed, and reality began to sink in. Murder meant a death sentence. Was it worth throwing everything away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was right&mdash;he was only twenty-four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really want to give up his entire future for this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's eyes flickered with uncertainty. She wasn't afraid. Not even a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," he said slowly. "What was the story you were going to tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze turned cold. "I don't feel like telling it anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's frustration boiled over. He dropped the knife, the metallic clang echoing through the room. His voice cracked with desperation. "Tell me, Diana. What's the story? Convince me, and I'll let you live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hell, I'll even help you take down Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes flicked to the knife on the floor, her brow furrowing slightly. Was he finally coming to his senses?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exhaled deeply, pulling the blanket over her injured leg as she sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel watched her slow, deliberate movements, his emotions a tangled mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's presence exuded an aloof confidence, but her eyes remained clear and calm. It was those eyes&mdash;untainted by fear&mdash;that made him lower the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Samuel moved to the sofa and sat down, waiting for her to speak.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="931.html">« Prev</a><a href="933.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
