She glanced at Queenie and found that her face distorted with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana immediately felt in a good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head and gazed at Steven. "Sure. I have never enjoyed such good treatment in my life, so can you start clearing the restaurant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was willing to do anything to irritate Queenie. After all, it didn't cost her money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie trembled all over. She clenched her fists so tightly that the sharp nails hurt her palms, but the pain could not stifle her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Diana deserve such treatment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, there are so many customers here. If we drive them away, it will affect our reputation," Queenie whispered. The movie had not yet been released. As a newcomer, she could not have been tainted.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was well aware of what was more important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he raised his eyebrows at Queenie and said, "As long as my wife likes it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dumbfounded and furious. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was sharp, and her usual gentleness was gone.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil frowned and gazed at the domineering Steven. He said. "Diana, it's disgusting to spend this scumbag's money. Leave it to me. I know the owner of this restaurant. I'll clear these people out directly and let you have dinner in peace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was dressed maturely today. With a sullen face, he appeared formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana winked at him. Why was he so stupid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was going to piss Queenie off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had been pampered by Steven before, but now he wanted to treat Diana the same way he had treated Queenie. This great difference could crush her self-esteem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why was Cecil causing trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, my husband is here, so it's not your turn to pay for it. You can just treat me to a meal next time." Diana smiled at Steven and pointed at Queenie. "You can talk to the boss now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven</span><span> stared deeply at her smiling face. She was incredibly stunning. The word "husband" that just came out of her mouth made him feel as if he heard the most beautiful voice in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded as if bewitched and said in a gentle voice, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie instantly exploded with rage. Steven was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, my stomach hurts. Please take me to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was acting again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled and mocked her, "Queenie, your stomachache has come just in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was embarrassed. In the past, if Steven was with Diana, she would use this trick to get his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being busy, he would send her to the hospital as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he just sat there, motionless.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven." Queenie said aggrievedly, "My stomach really hurts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn, Diana was courting death.</span><span> </span><span>Why didn't Samuel crash her to death last time? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just wait</span><span>, he would be out soon, and she would definitely be killed</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was pretty vindictive. More precisely, the Farley family, including Cecil, was vindictive. So Queenie had to settle for second best, teaming up with Samuel with the intention of using him to take Diana's life.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after the last failure, she lost the money she had invested.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a shame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Cecil, however, it was a blessing in disguise. The houses were popular, which gave him free advertising. He built houses of the best materials, and a steady stream of people bought them.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Steven and pushed him. "Hurry up! Your love has a stomachache. If you take her to the hospital too late, I'm afraid the pain will stop before she gets there."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="622.html">« Prev</a><a href="624.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
