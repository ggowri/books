Diana smiled and called out, "Hey, there you are. I missed you so much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale laughed in exasperation. "Diana, didn't I tell you that? You're just the adopted daughter of our family, so don't talk to me like that </span><span>in public</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if you miss me, do you deserve it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm warning you, don't talk to me like that, and I don't have a sister as vicious as you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at him like he was an idiot, passed him and jumped into Tobias' arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale turned to see that Diana was not calling him but the man behind him. Remembering what Diana had just said, he stood awkwardly in place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, seeing Diana being sweet and enthusiastic to another man like that, Gale was upset </span><span>for no reason. H</span><span>e was her real brother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tobias, are you picking me up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked cheerfully, holding Tobias' arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! You told me you would have dinner with me tonight, so I ordered the specials at Isabelle Restaurant, and they are all your favorites."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha-ha, you love me the most, and I wish that Julius and Hubery were home, so we could all go together."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias smiled dotingly and stroked Diana's head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They have known you left the Marsh family, and they were no longer angry with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew Julius and Hubery were furious. "I'll wait for them to come back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay! Let's go. Julius knew that you went into the office to work, and he transferred some money to your account, so did you get it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, I didn't have time to check my phone." Diana took out her cell phone and was stunned to see ten million dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes were full of surprise. "Tobias, that's so much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah! Hubery was angry when you left back then, because he was afraid you would be bullied if you went back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew it, and she had tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tobias, I know, I know you all love me the most, but I can't leave yet. I have a few things to sort out. Tobias, you just have to watch from the side."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, Diana, I'm your real brother..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not my brother. What was the first thing you said when you came in just now? You told me to go back and apologize to Queenie and that you'd forgive me, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I haven't done anything</span><span> wrong</span><span>, and I'm not going back to apologize to her. You can go back and ask her if she dares to accept my apology.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, you just said I was just an adopted daughter of your family. I'm sorry that I'm not even your family's adopted daughter, because I've signed an agreement to cut ties and I have nothing to do with the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie is trying to insult and teach me a lesson through you, and I'm only going to make it worse for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, you're just a pawn in Queenie's hands against me, and I'll see how she will destroy you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale looked furious. He was arrogant and domineering since he was a little boy, so he didn't want Diana to be so rebellious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, even though I don't </span><span>see</span><span> you as my own sister, you were always born to the same mother as me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, you don't have to admit it, and I'll never </span><span>see</span><span> you as my brother for the rest of my life. You've hit me many times this year because Queenie set me up. From now on, you have nothing to do with me no matter what happens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you </span><span>guys</span><span> spoil Queenie? Later, she might give you a large gift that you'll never forget."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you wicked girl. I told you to go back and apologize to Queenie..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What if she won't go?" Tobias stepped in front of Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale frowned, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A hint of viciousness appeared in Tobias' eyes, as if he wanted to devour Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale was shocked by Tobias' formidable attitude, and he frowned slightly, seeing the murderous intent that Tobias hid in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am Diana's brother, the Marsh family has framed and bullied Diana for the past two years, so I will take my time to settle the score with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, she's not your biological sister</span><span>. W</span><span>hy would you make an enemy of the Marsh family for a cruel woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale didn't believe Tobias was capable of making an enemy of the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! The one with the ruthless mind is Queenie, but </span><span>you</span><span> assholes just can't see it as if you were blind."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon saying that, Tobias raised his fist forcefully and punched Gale in the face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..." Gale staggered a few steps from the punch, and he looked at Tobias through clenched teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare to hit me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="89.html">« Prev</a><a href="91.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
