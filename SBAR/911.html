I'll take care of everything on my end.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of hope flickered in Diana's eyes. Dalton reaching out to her meant something significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana responded: [Please, don't call me Mrs. Gellar at the office. Just use my name.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton acknowledged her request: [Yes, Ms. Bishop.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana put her phone away and powered her wheelchair into the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she reached the first floor, she found Luna already up and preparing breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, come on over for breakfast. It's a simple morning feast&mdash;pasta!" Luna called out cheerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled. "Sounds great! I love pasta."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wheelchair was automatic, gliding smoothly toward the table. She glanced at the steaming plate of pasta, a winter favorite of hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, by the way, could you call Nick and Barry to come protect me? I can't put any weight on my leg right now, so I'd like them to stick with me. No need for them to hide in the shadows anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick Portman and Barry Donald were the bodyguards Leopold had arranged for her. They always kept a watchful eye from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were highly skilled and wouldn't show themselves unless absolutely necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the person behind Queenie had made an appearance, there was no need to hide anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Diana. I'll reach out to them right now," Luna said, already dialing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna had the two of them wait outside the villa and then had breakfast with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Luna wheeled Diana outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bitter cold nipped at them, and the snow blanketed everything in sight. Diana braced herself against the chill, knowing this Christmas was destined to be anything but peaceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, two mature and composed, handsome men were waiting at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Diana, they greeted her respectfully, "Ms. Bishop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noted how much more mature and confident they appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled. "Let's head to the office. You'll be with me for protection during this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Bishop," Nick replied, glancing at Luna. "Luna, I'll push Ms. Bishop from here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick was skilled with firearms and martial arts, while Barry excelled in computer technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those skills wouldn't be enough. A tough battle lay ahead. She would need all the talent around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The groundwork laid earlier was all in preparation for this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pulled out her phone and called Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her memory, his computer skills were exceptional, and he had a bright future ahead of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph answered, and his voice brimmed with joy as he picked up the call early in the morning. "Diana, I'm so glad to hear from you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joseph, are you free from school? I could really use your help for a while. I want you to be the technical director at my company. If you're willing, head over to the Gellar Group right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, Diana! I've found someone to look after my grandma, so I can come help you. I'll be there in no time," Joseph replied, and excitement was evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled. "No rush, but just so you know, there will be challenges ahead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not scared, Diana. I'll be there soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled as she hung up, feeling a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was falling into place. After Nick helped her into the luxury van, they set off for the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving at the company building, Diana stepped out, and Nick continued to push her through the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were met with resistance as the security guard eyed them coldly. "Who are you? Do you have an appointment? If not, you need to leave now," the guard barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Barry. "Barry, don't coddle some ungrateful employees like him. Just toss him out. No need to be polite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Bishop," Barry replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a synchronized sound of footsteps echoed behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty bodyguards stood outside, a formidable presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop," they greeted in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded slightly, unfazed by the intimidation factor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard glared at Diana, and his voice dripped with disdain. "Diana, what do you think you're doing? Mr. Gellar is inside, and he said there's no way you're getting in. You need to leave. This isn't a place for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana leaned back in her wheelchair, and her eyes were cold and piercing, filling with an icy resolve. "The one who needs to leave is you! You clearly don't know who you're working for. Didn't the HR department notify you? The company's under new management!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the guard could respond, the bodyguards swiftly ejected him from the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana left two of them stationed at the door as a precaution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph emerged through the swirling snow, and urgency was in his stride. Despite the frigid air, beads of sweat dotted his forehead, but they couldn't mask his strikingly handsome features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled at him. "Joseph, you made it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, what happened? Why are you in a wheelchair?" he asked, and concern etched on his face as he knelt in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes filled with a fierce intensity as he thought, "Who hurt her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana studied him, noticing how much more mature and composed he had become during their time apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing serious. I was in a car accident a few days ago. I'll be back on my feet soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph looked at Nick, and his expression was serious. "Can I push Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick glanced at Diana, who nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped aside, allowing Joseph to take over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," Diana said, and they all headed to the elevator, making their way to the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they stepped out of the elevator, they were confronted by another bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you need to leave immediately. Mr. Gellar said if you return all company assets, he won't pursue any legal action against you," the guard loomed over her and said with authoritative tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Nick. "Nick, get rid of all these guards. They're not allowed to set foot in here again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Bishop," Nick replied, waving his hand to signal the other bodyguards to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp voice cut through the tension. "Everyone, stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sauntered out of the office. Her hips swayed as she approached, and an air of arrogance radiated from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, this isn't a place for you to act out. This is Steven's company, and you need to get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed coldly. "Queenie, if deceiving yourself brings you joy, then by all means, keep at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But everything here is under my name now. The paperwork is all signed off as Diana's. What are you two planning? To run a hostile takeover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's frustration boiled over. She had come to Steven's office this morning looking for confidential files, only to find nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "How could he have managed to hide everything overnight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, since you've shown up today, you'd better return everything," Queenie said, ready to use any means necessary to reclaim the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana straightened her posture, revealing her confidence. "Queenie, what gives you the right? Is it your theatrics, your tears, or your attempts to play the damsel in distress to catch a man's attention?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but I'm a woman too, and your crocodile tears won't work on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, George emerged from the office with disbelief. "Diana, don't push your luck. I'm warning you. This is my company, and you need to leave right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe Diana had the audacity to show up.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="910.html">« Prev</a><a href="912.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
