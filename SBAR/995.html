Marrying a malicious woman, having her bear my child, it's better to remain single for life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi didn't speak. He silently stood up and stumbled away, thinking to himself that he would take revenge. Even if the Robinson family went bankrupt, they still had assets, and they could climb back step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd deal with Queenie later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie breathed a sigh of relief. She understood Levi's personality well. He only wanted to vent his anger on her for now, and then find a way to stabilize the company's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandra worked quickly, her efficiency matching that of Felicity. Queenie smiled in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning her head, she deliberately gave Cecil a strange look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil froze for a moment, feeling that Queenie's gaze was telling him that one day, he'd end up like Levi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stared at Cecil. In her dreams, the most loyal person was undoubtedly Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had power, influence, and capability. But right now, he wasn't hers. So the only choice was to destroy him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should go," Queenie said quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George then pushed her to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hadn't missed Queenie's glance earlier. She looked at Cecil, who was still frozen in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a reaction formed by the reflex of his worst nightmares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to Luna beside her, speaking softly, "Luna, you follow Levi. Nick will take Olivia and me back. Go see who Levi is meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna said, "Understood, Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil regained his composure, feeling uneasy about Luna going alone. He quickly said, "Diana, I'll go with Luna."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a little surprised and asked with a smile, "Aren't you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil paused, a faint smile on his face. "Diana, when did I ever say I was afraid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People who have never seen his bravery would never understand how courageous he really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To meet him, everything around would become a mere backdrop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil felt that every day he lived now, he grew more enlightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes crinkled, and she said with a smile, "If you're not afraid, then go with Luna."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was firm. "I must go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled and made a call to have Nick come over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and Cecil went off to follow Levi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George had no idea about Diana's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia also helped Diana toward the parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around the corner by the elevator, Evan and Steven were hiding behind, watching the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan didn't understand. "Mr. Gellar, what is it about Queenie that makes these men follow her so loyally, only to end up with nothing after being manipulated by her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't understand either. Even he couldn't help but want to treat Queenie well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought wasn't a one-time thing but had happened many times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was for the sake of a realistic act, or maybe her innocent appearance had deceived him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had never forgotten his goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Diana's retreating figure, his heart aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had risked everything, placing her happiness in his hands, yet in the end, he made her lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life was long. One day, he would learn to love Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven quietly explained, "Queenie is very skilled at manipulating people's hearts. When she gets close to someone, she thoroughly investigates them, understanding their preferences and needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She helps many people at crucial moments, using their sincerity to further her own career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Different people do different things for her. Especially those who need money. When they have Queenie's support, their lives change completely. What they care about is something Queenie helped them achieve, and naturally, they remain loyal to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why over the years, they had all been led around by Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being with Queenie for years, Steven hadn't realized these secrets about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought Queenie was just a woman Andrew used to deal with him. He believed she posed no threat because she was the kind of woman who only sought favor. He never imagined she could be so dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he saw the photos Diana showed him that he realized things weren't that simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That moment was when he finally woke up to how na&iuml;ve he had been before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan took a deep breath. "Mr. Gellar, we should head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they both wore their masks, daring to show up in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded slightly. "As for Jace, how's the arrangement going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was curious to see Jace's bold counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan responded, "I've arranged a place for him. I'm not sure what his next move is, but he knows we're using him. Still, he doesn't mind and will counterattack Queenie fiercely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was also a chance for an unexpected turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't place all his hopes on Jace. Queenie had managed to take a part of the Foliot family's fortune and could prepare for future defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said nothing, waving his hand for Evan to help him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick drove Diana and Olivia home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let Olivia choose a room she liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Olivia hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her hesitation, Diana smiled, "Olivia, if you like my library, you can stay there. It's fine if I'm alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia's thirst for knowledge came from Diana's study, which wasn't just a study. It was a small library.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia smiled, "Diana, you really understand me. Don't worry. I'll only be in the study or guest room. I won't touch anything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, a bright smile showing on her face. "I don't know why I want to stay here. It's better when someone is here. Go ahead and stay at my house. I know the books in the study are tempting, but don't stay up too late. You need rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia happily went over and gave her a hug. "Okay, Diana, you're so kind! I'll come over for breakfast tomorrow morning. I just checked. The two villas aren't far apart. I'll walk over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice was light and cheerful. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia grabbed her suitcase and went to stay at Diana's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana called the butler to change the sheets and make the room more comfortable for Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was arranged, Diana went upstairs to freshen up. Then she limped into her room to work, discussing the smart healthcare system with Tom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom: [Diana, I have to say, Joseph is really reliable. With him on board, the program was modified and is now much more accurate.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Joseph's abilities. That night, she was lucky to have met him first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, no wonder Queenie had personally gone after Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana: [Tom, I'll come over tomorrow morning to do a test myself, but be cautious of Queenie's people. I'm afraid she might have placed someone in the lab to sabotage things.]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="994.html">« Prev</a><a href="996.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
