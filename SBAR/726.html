He had also seen the news, but he didn't believe Queenie would cheat on Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He guessed Steven might also be upset about Queenie's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen looked at the sad Steven and chuckled, "Who knows? Maybe he's just in a bad mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson nudged Steven. "Steven, are you worried about Queenie? Queenie's pregnant, right? Is it your child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven froze when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He thinks the baby is mine too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He warned in a hoarse voice, "Don't talk nonsense. If you don't speak, no one will think you're mute."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson laughed in anger. "Why so grumpy? I'm just worried about you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what's there to be upset about? After the divorce, marry Queenie, and everything will be solved, right? Is that woman, Diana, unwilling to divorce? A bumpkin who can't do anything actually wants to be the wealthy Mrs. Gellar?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she can, then my sister can, too, and my sister is so much more capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson smiled with pride when he mentioned his sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave him a cold glance. "Who told you Diana was some country bumpkin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson took a casual sip of his wine, lounging back with a smirk. After draining his glass, he raised an eyebrow at Steven. "Weren't you the one who used to think your wife was just some simple girl? Always hovering around you, no job, no career, completely helpless, and just wanted to be your trophy wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Walking around in those tacky clothes. It made me sick watching her trying to please you all the time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen quickly jumped in to shut Yanson up. "That's enough, Yanson. You're out of line. Diana spent those years taking care of Steven and had no time for herself. We all saw how she personally handled everything for Steven. Queenie just visited him occasionally, and never took care of him for a single day. What you're saying is completely unfair."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson shrugged it off and continued, "Don't be fooled by Diana's innocent looks. She's clueless, a high school dropout. Besides waiting tables, she couldn't land a decent job. Her kindness to Steven? It's all an act, a desperate attempt to snag a rich husband and become a trophy wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, she was the other woman who wrecked someone else's relationship..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Diana is my wife, and she was never the other woman!" Steven cut him off icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly realized with a jolt that his friends had all come to view his wife as nothing but a gold-digger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't pinpoint precisely when his friends had started belittling his wife like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd heard it at gatherings, but back then, he didn't really understand Diana, had misconceptions about her, and never stood up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back now, their contempt and dismissal of Diana had been incredibly shallow and unfair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, he'd lost himself in their warped perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Diana chose to let go of their relationship - it indeed wasn't worth holding onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people had dismissed her genuine feelings and devotion as mere attempts to curry favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he stood up and looked at Evan. "Evan, we're leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson was taken aback and let out a chuckle. "Steven, are you actually angry about this? Didn't you used to think the same way? I've said far worse things before and you never got mad. What's suddenly changed today?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="725.html">« Prev</a><a href="727.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
