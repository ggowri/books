Hasn't he had any social engagements lately?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was unwilling to hear that; she had enjoyed Steven's favor for over a decade. Suddenly, Steven no longer doted on her, which made her very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was too anxious and didn't expect Diana to suddenly retaliate, exposing everything she had done in front of Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, Steven actually believed Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario said, "Although he has social engagements, he has been staying at the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie whispered, "Let's go, take me to find him. The connections around him are very helpful to us."

It had been nearly a year since she left, and he still hadn't forgotten how well she took care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked the time on his phone; it was already past six in the evening, and his stomach was feeling quite uncomfortable from hunger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up, thinking of asking Evan to prepare something to eat when Evan came in and said, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Marsh is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded slightly. "Bring her in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he continued to dote on Queenie, would Diana come over to confront him, questioning why he did that to her, his legitimate wife?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered if Diana would, like before, tell him not to see Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was taken aback, looking at his agitated yet handsome face. He shook his head slightly, still believing Queenie to be the most important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what her nature was, in his heart, she was always the best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Evan left, Queenie walked in with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I heard you haven't left work yet, so I came to see you. Shall we go for dinner together?" Queenie tentatively invited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at her smile and nodded slightly. "Let's go." He picked up the coat from the sofa and approached her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt a sudden joy in her heart. Steven indeed could not forget the feelings they had shared since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at his upright figure with infatuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed herself to have a good figure, good looks, and to be gentle and considerate, yet Steven still didn't want to give her an extra glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was tall and broad-shouldered, with a waist that looked very strong. Although his legs had been injured, they still appeared powerful after being healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His physique was excellent, and he was very clean. Unfortunately, Steven only had physical contact with her but never wanted to have sex with her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="539.html">« Prev</a><a href="541.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
