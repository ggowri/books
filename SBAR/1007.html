If I'm right, today's the day he goes bankrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Foliot left for a trip yesterday, but before she left, she made all the arrangements. I just got a message from her telling me to go watch the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil squinted, knowing Jeff's bankruptcy was already inevitable. There wasn't much to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana liked it, so he took her anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff spent the entire day and night at the office, personally reviewing every collaboration proposal. But today, there were no calls, and that unsettled him. The calls from his partners, which he'd been expecting, weren't getting through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic set in as he paced around his office. The unease gnawed at him, leaving him restless. His body felt off&mdash;his chest ached faintly, and his mind raced. He stared out at the gloomy sky, the dark clouds only adding to his growing sense of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to wait any longer, he called his assistant, Jordan Hamilton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Jordan. What's going on? Why can't I reach our partners today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just about to call you, Mr. Jeff Marsh. All of our business partners have pulled out. The company that acquired the Foliot family's business is under investigation for illegal activities. It's been shut down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Jeff couldn't believe his ears. The unease that had been building inside him now hit with full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hadn't lied to him. The entire situation was Lily's trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's impossible! What are you doing? Stop them! Get the authorities to back off&mdash;don't let them investigate my company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was furious. It had all come so suddenly. With only one day, he hadn't had enough time to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark's company had a few questionable dealings, sure, but he'd cleaned them up. There was no way it should be falling apart now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan's voice was strained. "Mr. Jeff Marsh, I've done everything I can. I couldn't stop the authorities from shutting us down. And it's worse than that&mdash;the bank we borrowed from just called, demanding we repay the loan immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's one more thing, Mr. Jeff Marsh. It's come to light that you've been reported for tax evasion. The authorities are already on their way to find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's phone slipped from his hand, clattering to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Amelie walked in just in time to see Jeff's distressed expression. Over the past few days, she had been visiting his office regularly, trying to salvage whatever she could of their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his ashen face, she quickly approached him, her concern evident. "Jeff, what's going on? What's happened? Why do you look so terrible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jeff saw Amelie, his eyes blazed with fury. If it weren't for this woman, he never would have ended up in this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was full of hatred as he looked at her, and in a flash, he seized her by the neck with both hands, his grip tightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Amelie's vision blurred as the pain shot through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrified by the murderous look in Jeff's eyes, she gasped for breath. "Jeff... please... let go of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go?" Jeff's voice was cold, filled with malice. He wanted nothing more than to strangle her. There was no way he was going to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, like an endless abyss, sent a chill down Amelie's spine. She could see nothing but the darkness within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's rage boiled over, his voice a growl, like a lion about to rip apart its prey. "It's all because of you. All because of you, I've lost everything. Paula loved me so much, but I betrayed her and ended up with someone like you&mdash;a useless trophy. You've ruined my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the real villain here. I'll kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with bloodlust as if he were a demon from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was terrified. She pounded on Jeff's arm in a desperate attempt to break free, but the pain was too much. She couldn't even get a word out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was happening to him? Why was he acting like this?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped for air, her body wracked with pain, feeling as if death was closing in. Panic set in, and she could only think of one thing&mdash;she didn't want to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved money, yes, but she wanted to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had so much life ahead of her&mdash;she couldn't die like this, at the hands of this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help... help..." she choked, her voice barely a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the office was empty, and she was completely alone with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was strike weakly at his arm, her world narrowing to the suffocating grip around her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's neck was trapped in Jeff's grip, his hand like a vise, the veins bulging as he squeezed harder. It felt as if an iron clamp had locked around her throat, and she couldn't move an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suffocating pressure overwhelmed her like a tidal wave, making it almost impossible for her to breathe. Her face turned bright red from the lack of oxygen, and her eyes rolled back as she fought to stay conscious, the sight of her desperate struggle chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried with every ounce of strength to scream for help, but only weak, gasping "ahh" sounds escaped her throat&mdash;hoarse and faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff, if you kill her, you'll go to prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold voice cut through the chaos, freezing Jeff in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of Paula's voice, Jeff's anger faltered, and he snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie turned her head to the door, her heart racing. Paula stepped in, no longer hiding behind any pretense. Dressed in a luxurious rose-colored suit, she exuded elegance and charm with every movement, radiating a grace that seemed effortless, almost innate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula." Jeff's voice was low, filled with tension, as he shoved Amelie away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough... cough..." Amelie gasped for air, her lungs burning as she inhaled deeply, tasting the sweet relief of oxygen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's arrival had saved her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weak and shaken, Amelie collapsed onto the floor, her body trembling with exhaustion. She breathed heavily, her throat aching, and the pain made her feel nauseous, as though she might vomit from the sheer intensity of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie gagged several times, but nothing came out, her body trembling with the effort as she gazed at the immaculate Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula watched her with a faint smile. "Amelie, you once tried to take everything from me. You schemed and plotted, but in the end, it was all for nothing. How does that feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold laugh, Paula stepped into the room, her heels clicking sharply against the floor. Each step sounded like it was crushing Amelie's heart, the rhythmic echo of her shoes felt like a relentless reminder of her failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie stared blankly at the elegant Paula, her gaze a tangled mix of envy and deep, bitter jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's appearance now was everything Amelie had fantasized about on countless lonely nights&mdash;the life she had always longed to live. But now, she realized the truth. Paula's life was the one she could never reach, no matter how hard she tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you're despicable. If you hadn't discovered Queenie's plan, I would be in your shoes now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's words dripped with hate&mdash;hate for Queenie's incompetence, and for the years she had wasted following Paula, learning everything, yet accomplishing nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked down at her with a cold, triumphant gaze. "Not bad. If I hadn't caught on to Queenie's scheme, your fate would have been mine. But in this world, there are no 'ifs'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Facts are facts. A thief will never live forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had been waiting for this day&mdash;for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, it was Queenie's turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hate in Paula's eyes was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for this family of three&mdash;Jeff, Amelie, and Queenie&mdash;Diana would never have left her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Jeff dropped to his knees before Paula, gripping her hand with desperation, tears streaming down his face as he begged for her forgiveness. "Paula, I was wrong. Everything that happened was my fault. Please, let's get back together!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1006.html">« Prev</a><a href="1008.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
