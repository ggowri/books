Make them the best coffee. We will sell this company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elina smiled, lowered her head, and said, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned and walked out. Then, Linda said, "Let's go and see how the other party plans to acquire the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula knew that the other party was willing to acquire the company because of the previous withdrawal of investment and the fact that some of the partners had been bribed by the other party. But could they really get what they wanted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled strangely. After today, she would go back to fight the enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana did not go to the company but went back directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she arrived at the gate, she saw Steven waiting there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall and straight figure stood in the snow, like a pine tree standing proudly in the snow, alone and apart from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana found it a little funny. Since Queenie came back, Diana only met him two or three times a month, but now he met her two or three times every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stopped the car and asked him, "Mr. Gellar, what's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, he had the patience to wait for her here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she was the one waiting for Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to be the first time he waited for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Steven saw her coming back, he brushed off the snow on his coat, looked at her injured arm, and said, "You're injured, so why are you still driving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned again. Was he concerned about her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. This car has an automatic transmission, and I can drive it. It's convenient for me to drive out by myself," Diana said in a calm tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, she expected a little concern from him, but now, she didn't want anything and didn't need his concern at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, looking at her pale face, and he actually felt a little pain in his heart. "You let Samuel out, and he will still attack you. What do you think about that? Diana, you have left a hidden danger for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana understood what he meant. In the snow, she smiled beautifully, "Steven, I have been a housewife for two years. In your eyes, I am just a country girl, but I am not someone you want to mess with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't let anything happen to herself easily until she saw Queenie go to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, revenge was only a part of her life, and her own life was the most important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I will not die easily without seeing you go to hell. I will watch you die first, or be killed by the woman you love the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he was stunned. "Diana, do you hate me so much that you want me to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I remember all the suffering, grievances, and insults you have inflicted on me. I will retaliate against them bit by bit. Something happens to those people from the Marsh family, and then it will be your turn next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, get as far away from me as possible, and don't bother me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you were doing those disgusting things... You still posted the photos of you having sexual intercourse to disgust me. Steven, you are the most despicable man in the world. I feel sad for having loved you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana." Steven was furious. "Say it again if you dare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, and the sound of his anger was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was also frightened by him. She looked aggrieved and didn't know why she broke down emotionally. Was it because of his sudden concern or something else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't know, but she knew that the moment Steven expressed his concern for her, she seemed to be enraged and spoke without thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, she felt really wronged. She didn't blame him for not loving her, but why did he humiliate her? Why did he mistreat her?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="534.html">« Prev</a><a href="536.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
