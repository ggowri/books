Winter had come. Jeff had gone back to that woman again. As she glanced at the photos taken by the detective, her sorrow deepened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Steven left, he went to find Owen, who had just returned from abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen, freshly out of the shower, was surprised to see Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What brings you here?" Owen asked, casting a glance at the door. "Didn't Queenie come with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned. "Why would you think I'd bring her with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen responded with a half-smile. "Since Queenie came back, haven't you two been inseparable? You take her with you wherever you go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled wryly. "She's been by my side for many years, and I've treated her well, but I'm tired of the tricks she's been playing behind my back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen chuckled disbelievingly. "Alright, I'll just think you were joking. Come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven entered. He seldom visited Owen's place. Owen lived in a large apartment with a black and white decor, exuding a cold atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned slightly, not a fan of this decor style.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen took some wine and poured him a glass. "Care for a drink?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sat down and replied, "Yes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He drank the wine in one go, then spoke somberly, "I never truly knew Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt depressed. The girl who used to smile at him in her youth was kind, so why resort to such dirty tricks in the dark?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen poured him another glass of wine, smiling coldly. "Regret it? You finally realize Diana truly cares for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Raising an eyebrow, Owen looked at him with a smile. Steven wasn't a womanizer, and the only women in his life were Queenie and Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past two years, he had been consumed with work for the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he was almost done with his work, his wife left him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's upbringing had left him clueless about love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen was surprised that he could still be kind to Queenie despite his upbringing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After meeting her a few times, Owen found her boring. She was too skilled at pretense, but Steven liked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I prefer girls like Diana," Owen smiled suggestively, not for any other reason than her beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven regarded him with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen merely smiled and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Refilling his glass, Steven said sadly, "Diana is determined to divorce me this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen chuckled. "You seem reluctant. But isn't divorce what you've always wanted?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="362.html">« Prev</a><a href="364.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
