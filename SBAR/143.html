I've been watching the livestream the whole time. This woman just came looking for trouble herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"When she can't win the argument, she just cries. Such a weak little damsel. Who cares about her self-pity? Everyone's focused on results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The evidence against Harry is undeniable. What's wrong with these reporters? Do they think the police department's official statements are fake?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This disabled mom is just playing the pity card. Everyone's all about sympathizing with the weak these days. Did she forget to check what terrible things her son did? How dare she come out here for sympathy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The number of people in the livestream was increasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was dumbfounded watching Queenie improvise her way through this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She widened her eyes, giving a slightly pouty look. She was adorably cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh my gosh, this girl is so cute! She's gorgeous, and she speaks so well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's my future wife right there, step aside everyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven couldn't help but smile seeing this lively version of Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana, watching Queenie cry theatrically, waved her hand in annoyance. "Queenie, stop crying. Are you trying to be dramatic like some cheesy commercial? Cry all you want, the reality won't change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"By the way, you and Harry have been best buddies for years, right? What are you crying for? Go save him already! You've got the money and the skills, right? Go bail him out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm the victim here, and you're still coming after me. Is it because I'm an orphan, easy to pick on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If they had no shame, why should she hold back? Diana felt satisfied going all out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anger filled Queenie's eyes. "Diana, stop making things up. I'm not even friends with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tsk, if Harry hears you say that, I bet he'll break out of jail just to come for you first," Diana said lazily, giving Queenie a knowing smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie, no matter how tough you act, I'll tear off that facade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, y-you're going too far. How could you bully people like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Am I being more over the top than you? Look at your oversized face with that pancake makeup and thick lipstick. Isn't that exactly the look Steven likes? Go on, give him the full show!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ahhh... Diana, why are you so annoying?" Queenie yelled, losing control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana just smiled sweetly, watching Queenie lose it. Making an enemy tremble in rage. Now that she felt great.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm not living to please you. Whether you hate me or not, I couldn't care less. Feel free to keep hating me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was done going out of her way to be nice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you're having an affair with Harry! Since you can't get money out of him, you're trying to ruin him," Queenie shrieked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wanted to destroy Diana herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana suddenly laughed, an eerie sound. "Alright, you've had your performance. Now it's my turn. Since you claim I know him, why don't we show everyone how you used Harry to have me kidnapped?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's pupils contracted in shock. Her wide eyes were enhanced by perfectly drawn eyeliner, sparkled with fear. She looked almost pitiful in her frightened state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The men in the livestream felt a pang of sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now that's what my future wife should look like. She's so pure! I've heard her sing, play piano, she's amazing. I support you, girl. Justice is on your side!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How could such a cute girl do anything wrong? Diana must be framing my angel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Her piano playing is so incredible. The way she moves her fingers is just magical. This girl is truly one of a kind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How could anyone bully such a beautiful girl? What are those reporters even doing? That other woman is clearly nasty inside and out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Guys, who else gets it? This girl is exactly my dream wife. But her piano skills are too good, and she's too beautiful for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was also watching the livestream, and seeing so many people bash Diana made her smirk inwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, public opinion online is a powerful weapon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had planned everything before coming, but it was Gale who brought the reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She merely used a little trick to make things more interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie lowered her eyes and whispered angrily, "Diana, why are you trying to frame me again? What did I ever do wrong? Why do you keep trying to hurt me?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="142.html">« Prev</a><a href="144.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
