His deep eyes flickered with a burning anger. "Diana, I'm your husband. How can you be so resistant to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her cry, he felt furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streaming down her face, Diana said, "Steven, you've never treated me as your wife. If you did, you wouldn't have sided with the Marsh family to bully me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no future for us. Whether it's the three-year agreement we had or the two years of separation, it's all coming to an end soon. I will file for divorce when the time comes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't get entangled with you anymore, and I won't give you another chance to hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wanted to live her life on her own terms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she faced a challenge, she worked hard to become stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew he had mishandled things in the past. Now, no matter what he said, she wouldn't believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone softened. "Stop crying. I'm not here to hurt you. I came to talk about a partnership on the AI treatment project."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him, stunned. Seeing that he was serious, she asked, "You read my proposal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded. "Yes. I bought the land to build a hospital, and part of that plan was to develop AI technology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at her with admiration, his long fingers gently caressing her delicate cheek. "Diana, I never realized how talented you are. You actually managed to develop AI diagnostics."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Diana smiled faintly. "It wasn't just me. It was the result of Micah's entire team working tirelessly, day and night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought back to the years of development, the countless days and nights when they faced technical hurdles one after another, yet they never thought of giving up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the beginning, almost no one believed in the project. They thought the technology was too advanced, too difficult to achieve. But we were convinced that AI diagnostics could change the future of healthcare," she said, her voice calm yet powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was the biggest challenge you faced during development?" Steven asked, intrigued. He was often away, and while he was gone, she had been working on all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only now did he realize how much he had overlooked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always thought of her as a naive country girl, but reality was proving him wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, he said, "The accuracy and security of the data must have been your biggest hurdles. Medical data is extremely sensitive, and any mistakes could have serious consequences. For AI to accurately diagnose various illnesses, it requires an immense amount of precise data for training."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven understood that their technology was still in its early stages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she listened, Diana could tell that he had taken the time to read through the materials she had prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Micah was overseas while I was here, and we collaborated with several renowned hospitals to gather a substantial amount of real-case data. We also implemented strict data management and encryption mechanisms. By continuously refining the algorithms, we've managed to improve the accuracy of our diagnostics," she explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven leaned lazily against the wall, watching her. The way she spoke about her work, so confident and composed, was a side of her he had never seen before. "So, what's your plan moving forward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked over to the sofa and sat down. "We plan to further expand the applications of AI diagnostics. We don't want it to just handle common illnesses; we want it to tackle rare and complex diseases as well. Our goal is for more patients to benefit from this technology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the confidence in her eyes, Steven believed that in the near future, she and her team would make even greater strides in the medical field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat down beside her, turning his head slightly to smile at her. "Diana, what else have you been hiding from me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="594.html">« Prev</a><a href="596.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
