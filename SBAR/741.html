You have to be sure Mark truly loves you before you decide to get a divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie nodded, her eyes shining with a hint of happiness. "Mark and I have been together for over twenty years, and our bond runs deep. Right now, he's organizing his assets. He's ending things with Lily, and soon, I'll be his only love. I've always been the one he truly cares about.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I once thought your father would end up with everything Paula had. But it's better that you have it instead. Living with him was exhausting. He's selfish, obsessed with appearances, and completely incompetent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I chose to be with Mark back then, I was making sure I had an escape plan, giving myself the power to leave the life I despised whenever I wanted. This way, I could live the life I truly wanted on my own terms.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Queenie, the only reason I stayed with your father was to make sure you didn't grow up as someone else's illegitimate child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie understood, but a part of her still felt a pang of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice caught as she said, "But, Mom, I still ended up as an illegitimate child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie saw Queenie's distress, and it pained her too. "Queenie, it's okay. I've already avenged you. You're on your way to success now. Without Paula, you can still make a name for yourself with your own talents."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought of her recent accomplishments and managed a small smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right!" she replied softly. "Mom, your issues are taken care of, so now it's time to take care of mine. I can't keep this baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie felt a headache coming on. "If only the child were Steven's."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Steven refusing to touch her sparked a flicker of rage in Queenie's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a cold smile. "Steven is useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie looked surprised. "What do you mean, useless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had thought this over, too. Steven was kind to her, and she'd tried to seduce him countless times, but he never reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was always distant and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, she came to one conclusion. She felt Steven just wasn't interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's like he's been influenced by his parents. He doesn't seem to feel anything for women. I could sit on his lap, and he'd have no reaction whatsoever."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie sighed, feeling exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie only wanted to end the pregnancy; she wasn't interested in anything else at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, will you come with me to get the procedure done somewhere else? I can't risk anyone finding out about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie knew how to handle it. "Come on, I'll take you to a small island. No one there will recognize you, so we won't even need to pay anyone to keep quiet."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie didn't want Queenie burdened by this child at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt confident that Amelie would cover her tracks and leave no evidence behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gathered their things and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Jeff slipped away quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Downstairs, his eyes burned with a furious glint. He never imagined that after his unwavering loyalty to Amelie, she would leave him for Mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the daughter he'd doted on since she was young had only ever seen him as a stepping stone. He felt humiliated, pathetic, a complete joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff let out a cold, bitter laugh, his eyes growing darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring out at the blinding white snow in the distance, he muttered under his breath, "Amelie, if you think you can get rid of me with five million dollars, you're sorely mistaken."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood in the freezing wind, and a more sinister plan began to form in his mind.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="740.html">« Prev</a><a href="742.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
