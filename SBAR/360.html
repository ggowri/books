Queenie felt like she wanted to kill Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you dare to hit Queenie?" Frank rushed out and protected Queenie behind him, glaring at Diana angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You dare to hit Queenie in front of Steven. You must bully her hard behind his back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're such a loser. You can't even take care of yourself, but you still stand up for others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana recalled the scene of Elsie hugging and kissing the man tonight. She would give Frank those photos when he got married to Elise as a gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had thought wrong before. Instead of watching Queenie deal with them, it would be better to watch them fight each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, Elsie tried to kill Paige to get Frank, so Diana would give this gift to Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, what do you mean? Why did you hit Queenie?" Frank asked angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said with a smile, "Because she seduced my husband. You are her brother, but you let her do this. Can you not control your sister?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could your family raise such a shameless daughter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana teased Frank with the words he had used to tease her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, when Queenie complained that Diana bullied her, Frank would say, "What did your adoptive parents teach you? Why do you always do such vicious things and seduce men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was not Diana's fault. Queenie gave up on her own, but in the end, Diana was blamed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned. Why did these words sound familiar?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was so angry that she couldn't even speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had changed completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing their expression, Diana felt depressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Were they her family and husband?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You guys make me sick. You're all hypocritical."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced at Steven and said, "My ex-husband, if you want a divorce, call me anytime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she left with an arrogant back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mottled light was cast on her back, making her look like an elf disappearing into the darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven chased after her and walked to her side. "You said you would come back with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stopped and looked at him, speechless. "No. I don't want to live with you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The plan you proposed is very good. Now you know what kind of person Queenie is. I don't want to make her angry. I want her to make you angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. She wanted to watch Queenie deal with them one by one. Then she would reap the benefits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven also smiled. So this was what Diana thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked very handsome. His bangs had grown longer, with some of them hanging in front of his forehead. His face looked more elegant, which still made Diana's heart beat faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Steven was too cunning, and she couldn't defeat him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his life, Steven no longer trusted Queenie. Would some things change?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe it would change, but Diana didn't know what it would be like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's ambition was far more than just marrying a wealthy man and living a life of luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What she wanted to be was the queen. Steven, Cecil, and Jace were all stepping stones for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Diana was attracted by Steven's handsome face, she didn't dare to love him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven compromised. "Okay, it's too late. I'll take you home. It's hard to get a taxi here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked around and found it difficult to get a taxi, but she had called a car online and it would arrive in a few minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I called a taxi online. I'll wait here. You should go back and take care of Queenie. I slapped her in the face. She must be very aggrieved now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's patience was almost exhausted by Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was harder to coax than Queenie. Queenie could be coaxed with just a bag, but Diana...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven suddenly realized that he hadn't bought anything for Diana before.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="359.html">« Prev</a><a href="361.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
