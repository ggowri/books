I'm afraid someone might cause trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom understood. "Okay, I get it. You've been busy for a whole day. Go back and have a rest. I'll be on duty at the hospital for the next three days. I'll ask someone reliable to keep an eye on this ward." Diana had specially reminded him, and Tom guessed that something dangerous would probably happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph knew that Diana was worried that Queenie would do something terrible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana guessed right. The next day, a woman disguised as a nurse and entered Priya&zwnj;'s ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just when the woman was about to pull out the oxygen tube, Joseph rushed in and stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman escaped in panic. Tom happened to come over with the medicine and saw the woman running away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom was stunned. He didn't stop the woman but hurried to check Priya&zwnj;'s condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That woman had just taken off Priya&zwnj;'s oxygen mask, and nothing severe happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay. If the oxygen mask had been removed for ten minutes, Priya would have died." Tom patted his chest in a panic. Fortunately, he had listened to Diana's reminder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom added, "Joseph, from now on, you can't leave here until Priya wakes up. I'll have people bring in food and daily necessities. If Priya has any problems, call me immediately. Tomorrow is the last day. If Priya can make it through tomorrow, she will be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked gloomy. "Okay. Thank you, Dr. Cullen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's my duty." Thinking that a medical accident had almost happened, Tom was still in a panic. He took a deep breath and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph looked at Priya&zwnj;'s sleeping face and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He whispered, "Grandma, you'll be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph swore in his heart, "Queenie, how dare you? I will take revenge on you. Just wait and see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana received a message from Joseph and learned that someone had removed Priya&zwnj;'s oxygen mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana reminded him not to leave the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie knew that her plan had failed and that it would be difficult to get another chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Mario coldly and asked, "Besides Joseph, is there anyone available?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario nodded. "Yes. There is no shortage of talent in this industry. This time, I found Joseph's opponent. The man's family is in a poor condition, and he applied for scholarships to pay for his university tuition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He added, "His talent is about the same as Joseph's."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's smile was weird and frightening. "Bring the man over. I want to meet him first before arranging for him to enter my company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario smiled, "Yes, Ms. Marsh. The man is Phillip Hanks, and he has better connections than Joseph. His teacher is Alger Nash."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was satisfied. "Great. Bring Phillip over right now. I want his team to work for my company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario smiled, "Ms. Marsh, you are so smart. They are young and ambitious. In order to make a name for themselves in the company, they will work hard for the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Young people, especially those from ordinary families, were ambitious, but they were easy to be deceived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie knew people's minds very well, so she only chose those who needed help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Go ahead. As for Joseph, since I can't draw him over to my side, I won't let others win him. Mario, find a chance to get rid of him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario nodded. "Okay. The person we sent has not been caught, but I guess Joseph might suspect us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sneered, looking confident and arrogant, "So what if he suspects us? What can he do to us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario thought so. Joseph had no power and wouldn't pose a threat at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passed quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana hadn't seen Steven for several days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She lay on the sofa. In her previous life, Steven went abroad and came back injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at that time, he no longer needed Diana. The person who was with him was Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tomorrow was Frank's wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana received a message from Paige in the afternoon, asking her to attend Frank's wedding the next day.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="370.html">« Prev</a><a href="372.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
