Why don't we go check on them? We wouldn't want Diana to bully her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's cold gaze settled on her worried expression. "I saw the evidence of what Harry did. How could you be friends with someone like that? When you introduced him to me, I thought he was decent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Haven't you been to the police station? They've committed rape, robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. Queenie, birds of a feather flock together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A trace of panic flashed in Queenie's eyes. He never used to meddle in these things. Why was he suddenly involved, and how did he find out what Harry had done?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stood up and coldly walked towards the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan and Queenie followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie certainly wasn't going to miss this drama.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today, she was determined to ruin Diana's reputation for good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Diana reached the front of her company, she was surrounded by a crowd of reporters. A boy with dyed hair was pushing a middle-aged woman in a wheelchair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment the middle-aged woman saw Diana, she began wailing, "Oh dear girl, what has my son ever done to deserve this? You seduced him and then had him kidnap you on purpose!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And now you've framed him and sent him to prison. He's my only son, and I'm a cripple! You work in such a grand place. Can't you spare him just this once?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana and Luna were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They came to cry in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana coldly looked at her and asked, "And who exactly is your son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoey hesitated under Diana's icy glare, then said nervously, "Harry. My son said you seduced him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I seduced him? I look like this, and I work in a place like this. You think I need to seduce some punk? Is he rich? Is he handsome? Is it worth ruining my own reputation for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoey was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Bishop, when we interviewed people, they all said you were seducing Harry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana let out a laugh of disbelief and looked at the female reporter. "Did you go to the police station? Did you check the surveillance footage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A female reporter replied, "The police wouldn't provide the surveillance footage..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So, who exactly are you interviewed? There's no evidence, but you're making baseless accusations? Aren't reporters supposed to stand for justice? I'm the victim here, the one who was hurt. Have you thought about how I feel while you're siding with her and turning the blame on me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No evidence, but you just take what people say as fact? How long have you marinated that mouth of yours for it to be this seasoned?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This woman really had some nerve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana took a step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The female reporter trembled with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was truly furious. Zoey was no good either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She really had the audacity to come here and cry in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dear girl... you've ruined my son like this. How am I supposed to live now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stop crying. I'm not your 'dear girl.' Who are you wailing for now? Why didn't you have the ability to raise your son properly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You've been to the police, haven't you? Your son did all these terrible things, so why are you here crying to me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're crying in front of everyone here, saying I seduced your son. Can you cry away the things he did?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you don't know my ways, don't push my buttons. I might end up 'forking' you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoey thought, "Is she cursing me to death?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Realizing what Diana meant, she yelled angrily, "But I heard you and my son are friends! Why are you framing him? Do you think we're easy to bully?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoey was desperately trying to throw dirt on Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana watched as she cried her heart out, pounding her chest like she was the victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tsk... I've seen people bind their feet, but never their brains. The evidence is all at the police station. I really envy how you can talk nonsense."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoey choked, completely unable to continue crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Bishop, do you really know Mr. Gall? Is there an inappropriate relationship between the two of you?" a male reporter aggressively asked, stepping forward.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="139.html">« Prev</a><a href="141.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
