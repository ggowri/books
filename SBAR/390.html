Our doctors here are highly skilled. It's just a stab wound."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't help but feel that Paige didn't seem to have much respect for his medical expertise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige offered an awkward smile. "Sorry, doctor, I was just too worried about him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor noticed her smile but sensed no real sincerity behind her apology, and it almost seemed like she hoped the patient would die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shaking his head, the doctor thought, What kind of family is this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, doctor, when we found him, he seemed to have lost his memory," Paige added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor responded, "From the head scans, we found that the back of his head had suffered a serious impact, causing blood clots that are blocking parts of his brain. Surgery isn't ideal in this area, so we'll observe for now. Once the clots dissolve, his memory should return. It's not too serious, and there's a high chance he'll remember everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige hesitated before asking, "Is there any way to make the memory loss permanent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking slightly disturbed by her persistence, he quickly walked away, his pace picking up until he was nearly jogging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, observing all this, couldn't help but laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige saw Diana laughing and sighed in disappointment. "You know, it's just unfair. How can someone as horrible as him have such good luck?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's smile faded as her expression grew thoughtful. "Maybe it's because he ran into us that he's having good luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Frank hadn't crossed paths with them today, he would've surely died. Things had turned out differently from what happened in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige felt conflicted. In the past, she had wanted Frank to get his comeuppance, but now she realized that trying to change his fate had always been a mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, she believed that not interfering in other people's destinies was a way of respecting their choices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, whatever happened to Frank in the future had nothing to do with her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they entered the hospital room, they found it spacious and bright, typical of the island's large building spaces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank lay on the bed, his face pale, looking lifeless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige looked worried. "Diana, Mrs. Paula Marsh has already cut ties with him. Jeff and Queenie might not even come to take care of him. If we don't help him, what will happen? And he might really have lost his memory."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, "Paige, call Mrs. Marsh. She won't abandon her son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew Paula's plan to send Gale abroad to protect him, and distancing Frank was meant to make Queenie see him as useless, preventing her from making Frank a target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige hesitated, knowing she had completely severed ties with the Marsh family, but she finally said, "Alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pulled out her phone and called Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige." Paula's voice was as gentle and kind as ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige said, "Mrs. Paula Marsh, Diana, and I were out diving when we found Frank. It looks like he got into a fight and was stabbed, then pushed into the sea. He happened to fall near where Diana was diving, and we brought him to the hospital. But I have work, and I don't have time to take care of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana has also cut ties with the Marsh family, so she's not obligated to help either. The only thing I can do is call you and ask you to send someone to take care of him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige's words were blunt. After all, there wasn't really a way to soften such a situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula took a deep breath. "Paige, I don't want to deal with him. Just hire a nurse, and I'll make sure to send the money to pay for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige didn't know how to respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Frank lying unconscious on the bed and couldn't help but feel how much he had failed as a person. After chasing Elsie for a year and humiliating himself, he had even broken Paula's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, Mrs. Paula Marsh," Paige said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hanging up, she relayed Paula's response to Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was surprised, thinking, "Paula really has given up on her son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, what should I do? I have work tomorrow." She really didn't want to have anything to do with Frank anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought about how Queenie was also on the island. If Queenie found out that Frank wasn't dead, she would definitely try to kill him and pin it on Diana. Queenie wouldn't miss an opportunity like this.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="389.html">« Prev</a><a href="391.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
