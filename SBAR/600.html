She had slept deeply the previous night and couldn't recall where he had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking it over, she asked again, "How exactly did you get in last night? I asked you, but you never answered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gave a calm smile, his tall frame looking graceful under the light. In a low voice, he said, "I climbed over the wall. My hands and arms got scratched up. After I showered last night, the wounds seemed to get infected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his arm for her to see. His palms were grazed, and the scrapes, soaked from water, were oozing a yellowish fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew how painful those kinds of wounds could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold laugh, she said, "There were plenty of times when you pushed me down, and my hands ended up just like that. It hurt back then, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you deserve it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she headed for the door, she added, "Thanks for telling me how you got in. Once the snow stops, I'll have the housekeeper put barbed wire up there. Next time, there's no way you're getting over it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at the scrapes on his hands and thought back to the times he had pushed Diana down while trying to shield Queenie. He'd never stopped to check if Diana was hurt; he'd just walked away. Back then, he had just taken over the company and spent almost all his time there, leaving no room for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, he really had climbed over the wall, and these scrapes were proof of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid arousing her suspicions by using the passcode, he had to resort to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he realized how painful it could be to have your palms skinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he had been wrong in the past, but he wasn't making any excuses for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go down for breakfast," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at him, her voice sharp with anger. "Steven, this is my house, not yours. And we're getting divorced. Can you please learn some boundaries?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You keep this improper relationship with Queenie. Do you think I'm okay with you doing the same with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven raised an eyebrow, a smile playing on his lips. "We're still married. How would that be improper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was momentarily stunned. She had forgetten that they weren't officially divorced yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed, she snapped, "Well, starting tomorrow, no, starting today, you're not allowed to come to my house anymore. My grandpa and Tobias will be back in a few days. If you don't want to be thrown out, you'd better keep your distance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Steven was already intruding on her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea what he was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's actions always left her puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her trying to kick him out again, Steven felt more angry, and his face darkened. "Why do you keep pushing me away, Diana? I told you we are husband and wife, and that means we should be living together. Either you move back, or I move in here. Even if Tobias and your grandpa come back, I can find a reason to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm warning you. Don't make me go after Tobias."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a surge of rage. She never thought he would dare to threaten her. "Steven, there's no way I'm staying married to you. Look at my chest. After you threw me out of the car, I got hit by another vehicle. It's been ages, but the injury still hurts. Why would I want to stay with a man who could lose his mind at any moment? Wouldn't I be better off with someone calm and kind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't think you can threaten me with Tobias. I've told you before, I don't care about anything you could use against me. You won't succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been careful, ensuring that Tobias's identity remained hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven might know her brother's name was Tobias, but she doubted he could uncover anything more about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was trembling with fury.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="599.html">« Prev</a><a href="601.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
