Queenie is watching you. Why are you standing in front of me? Are you trying to ruin my reputation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at her coldly. "Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood on tiptoe and whispered in his ear, "Why are you in such a hurry? When the time comes, I will put your names together on the trending topics.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not the right time yet. You'd better not destroy my plan. Otherwise, don't blame me for turning my back on you. I will now expose that Queenie is a mistress if you believe that the Gellar Group can withstand the attack of public opinion."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven suddenly realized something. Diana had always wanted him to make their marriage public, but now, she was determined to keep it a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gazed at Jasmine and asked coldly, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine raised her head proudly and said, "I am Jasmine Staggs."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!" Diana thought for a second and shook her head. "I don't know you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Jasmine's face turned pale. Everyone should be aware of her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana added, "I only know that you said you were a small potato.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm confused about whether you are a human being or a potato."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked that Diana misinterpreted Jasmine's words like this!!!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stepped forward and pretended to be gentle. "Diana, how can you say that about Jasmine? She did it for the sake of the banquet. If someone with ulterior motives gets in, it will be terrible."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised her eyebrows. Queenie's insincere appearance really disgusted her. She chuckled, "Why will it be terrible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana didn't compromise, Queenie wondered when she became so eloquent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was incredibly stunning. The uniquely cut black dress set off her delicate, smooth skin and full, rosy lips. She was like a blooming rose, full of charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie tried her best to hide her jealousy. Paula was very beautiful, and so was Diana, who bore a striking resemblance to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "In the past, unidentified people poisoned guests at banquets. The guests coming tonight are rich and powerful, so everyone should be on their guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, so she came to make things difficult for me. Queenie, I know she is a good friend of yours, Jasmine. Aren't you best at using your friends to attack me? One of them is going to jail. Now, I want to congratulate Ms. Staggs because she will be your pawn from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was panicky. How dare Diana talk nonsense on such an occasion?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you are not as mentally ill as your mother, are you? Why do you always like to accuse others wrongly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine didn't believe that Queenie would harm her. "Diana, stop your dirty tricks. Otherwise, I will take revenge on you. Trash should go back to where it belongs. This banquet is for the rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She poked Diana rudely in the chest with her finger and grinned haughtily.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was nothing now. How could Diana, an abandoned and impoverished daughter, sit on an equal footing with her here?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had a murderous intent. When Jasmine poked her a third time, Diana suddenly grabbed her finger and broke it with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine instantly howled in pain and burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! It hurts! It hurts so much. Diana is killing me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="645.html">« Prev</a><a href="647.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
