"Mr. Gellar, I couldn't track down that guy's whereabouts, but the chairman just called. He wants to see you tomorrow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My guess is he wants you to divorce and marry Ms. Marsh."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven scoffed, his eyes growing colder. "He thinks he can control me now? In his dreams!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan cautioned him, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Marsh is no fool. The fact that she sent those photos to Ms. Bishop shows she's not afraid of being caught. I really couldn't find any trace of that man."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They seemed to be stuck in a dead end.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven picked up a shrimp and looked at Evan.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan felt uneasy under his gaze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a forced smile, Evan asked, "Mr. Gellar, why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven finished his shrimp before responding, "Diana knows a lot, including the man behind Queenie. She's always been at odds with Queenie, waiting for her to destroy the Marsh family and me. That man is real."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was shocked. "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop must have one hell of a grudge to just sit back and watch all this unfold."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven narrowed his eyes, deep in thought. "No one cared about her skills before. Now that she's gone and starting to shine, Queenie's getting antsy."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan looked puzzled. "So what's the plan, Mr. Gellar?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven finally revealed his true intentions. "We need to plant our own person close to Diana."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head. "That's gonna be tough. Ms. Bishop only has Luna as her assistant. Apart from Luna, it's nearly impossible for anyone to get close to her."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven took a deep breath, recalling Diana's words about that man returning in a year.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't far off now.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget it then," Steven said, focusing on his meal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While eating, Evan kept an eye on the trending topics online. The buzz had died down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's camp hadn't responded yet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Gellar, someone's buried the trending topic."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said, "After we're done eating, I want you to find out who killed that story."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan nodded. "Alright!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't go to the office the next day. With the design issue settled, she did not need to be there. Instead, she drove to meet Althea.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie arrived early that morning looking for Diana, but she was out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana deliberately left Luna in charge of the company. Queenie, knowing Diana was the designer, wouldn't let her off so easily. Queenie would definitely find a way to ruin her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before leaving to meet Althea, Diana had told Luna to let Queenie into the office if she came looking for her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Queenie arrive so early in the morning, Luna's mood soured. Diana had been right all along.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie really did come.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes filled with envy as she saw Diana's office. "How could Diana deserve such a luxurious space?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Luna, her voice haughty. "Where's Diana? I'm here. Tell her to come out and see me."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="316.html">« Prev</a><a href="318.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
