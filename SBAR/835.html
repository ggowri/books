Now that she's pulled out all her support, your dad's company is on the verge of collapse. We can't afford these luxuries right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should save up for your future. You'll need money when you get married, and your dad has been stressed out over work lately. Let's just be practical, okay?" Amelie said, her tone clipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Jean heard that they couldn't buy the shoes, her heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But these shoes aren't even that expensive! They're just a few thousand dollars. Does my dad really not have that much to spare? Is it because my parents are divorced now that you feel free to treat me this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean's eyes bore into Amelie, filled with hurt and confusion. Deep down, she understood everything; she just didn't want to face it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie furrowed her brow, a flicker of coldness crossing her gaze as she watched Jean's disappointment. She knew exactly what the girl was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting on a wounded expression, she said, "Jean, is that what you really think? That my previous kindness was all a facade?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean's silence spoke volumes. She looked down, her eyes clouded with sadness. "Amelie, that's not what I meant. It's just that your attitude towards me has changed. You used to treat me like your own daughter, indulging me and showering me with love. But today, you've made me feel so let down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean understood everything clearly, but she hated the strict control her mother imposed on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She longed for a life filled with enjoyment rather than constant striving. She mused, "We were already wealthy&mdash;why do we need to hustle for more?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why should I work hard when I'd rather enjoy the life I want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Dad's company has lost Mom's support, I can't shop like I used to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mom may have been strict about my studies, but when it came to spending, she never held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even made sure I had the latest fashion every season."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts swirled in her mind, fear gripped Jean's heart. What if Lily really didn't want her anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark hardly paid her any attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie gently patted her shoulder, a smile on her face. "Jean, it's not that I care less about you now. We're just facing tough times, and we need to help your dad get through this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing those words made Jean smile. She mused, "See? I knew I was right. Amelie will always be there for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a familiar voice broke through her thoughts. "Diana!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean turned sharply to see her mother approaching, who was seated in a wheelchair and looking surprisingly well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her assistant pushed her along, and Diana was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Robinson, what a coincidence! I was actually on my way to your house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled warmly, saying, "I came to buy you a gift to thank you for saving my life. I wasn't sure what to get, but I thought I'd pick up a few winter coats for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, shaking her head. "Oh, Ms. Robinson, you don't need to go to such lengths. I'm a fashion designer, after all. I have plenty of clothes at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked a bit conflicted. "No, I insist! I really want to give you something. It'll make me feel better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a bit overwhelmed by her generosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about this? Let's go to your house and chat, or we could discuss a potential collaboration."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lily was keen on showing her gratitude, a fitting avenue would be through outstanding performance in her professional endeavors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled knowingly. "That sounds perfect! I hear you're a designer now. Coincidentally, my company has been focusing on live streaming for the past couple of years, and our clothing line has been doing really well. I'm a big fan of your designs. Why don't we talk about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana appreciated Lily's straightforwardness and her clear, bold spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Let's head out now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they left the mall, Jean watched Lily treat Diana with such kindness, even going out of her way to buy Diana gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Jean thought about it, the angrier she became, a fire igniting within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has she really forgotten about me, her own daughter, so quickly?" Jean thought, her heart racing with a mix of disbelief and resentment.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="834.html">« Prev</a><a href="836.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
