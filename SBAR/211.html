What else is in there besides your clothes? Were you hoping for a dainty young woman hiding there to warm your bed tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A trace of fear crossed his eyes. What was happening to him? Was he getting dementia?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wasn't Paula supposed to be the one getting dementia?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How did it become him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, did you drink your tonic today?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula shook her head, glaring at him angrily. "I'm pissed off. I stopped drinking that tonic you gave me because it made me lose my memory and feel less energetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm beginning to wonder if you're trying to kill me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's gaze was fixed firmly on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was startled and desperately defended himself, "Paula, don't overthink it. I wouldn't dare do such a thing, and I wouldn't want to hurt you. I only did it for your sake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula remained expressionless. "Yes, I know you love me most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I switched to a different tonic recently. I've been energized these past two days and even secured a big deal, stabilizing the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff blinked, filled with hatred. His plan was falling apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula pushed his shoulder. "Hurry up and put your clothes on. What do you think you look like? Why aren't you even wearing a shirt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula left, looking disgusted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff blinked, growing more frightened the more he thought about it. His face turned pale as he looked down at himself in only his underwear, utterly confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was sure he had come out wearing pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Where had his pants gone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wait a minute, he suddenly looked at himself. Hadn't he come out wearing clothes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Where were his clothes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula, I was definitely wearing clothes just now!" he called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula turned and looked at him. "Are you sick? You're acting crazy in the middle of the night. When did you ever come out here fully dressed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Paula left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff stood frozen in place, too scared to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slapped himself hard twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face stung. He wasn't dreaming, nor was he hallucinating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It must have been the alcohol that made him forget to wear clothes and pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But was what he saw in the wardrobe just now also a hallucination?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff felt both confused and frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula stood at the door, her gaze dark as she looked at Jeff's back. "Jeff, just wait and enjoy my revenge," she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula smiled as she returned to her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff had indeed come out wearing clothes, but a brief hallucination made him strip them off himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had taken off his pants too, but he had no memory of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What he saw was real, but when he looked again, she had turned off the projector with the remote.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was all a projection designed by her to make Jeff live in constant torment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, the tonic she gave him daily was mixed with the poison she had been taking before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One day, he would develop dementia himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula stared at the dark night outside, her lips tightly pressed together, her eyes gradually turning red with coldness in her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She whispered, "Diana, once I take care of things here, I'll bring you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, when Diana arrived at the office, Luna rushed up to her and shouted angrily, "Ms. Bishop, our design sketches have been stolen by Emma!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="210.html">« Prev</a><a href="212.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
