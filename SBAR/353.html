Diana is a vicious woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes turned cold and ruthless. He smiled teasingly, "In the video you showed me, the powder is the medicine that Diana gave me to treat my stomach disease. I still have some in the cupboard in the kitchen. Do you need some to identify?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was stunned. "Well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes were full of panic. No wonder Steven didn't believe her after she showed him the video. It turned out that he knew about the medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie hated Diana very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She explained in a soft voice, "Steven, I didn't know that this was the stomach medicine for you. Mrs. Jenny Gellar was poisoned, and someone happened to send me this video, so I thought it was Diana who poisoned her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven joked, "I thought you slept with my dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan wanted to laugh but didn't dare to. Steven finally defended Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had defended Diana like this before, they wouldn't have broken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was annoyed, and his face flushed red. "Steven, what nonsense are you talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven raised his eyebrows and looked at Queenie. "I just thought so, like what Ms. Marsh did."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did Steven call her Ms. Marsh?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I'm sorry. I was worried about Mrs. Jenny Gellar. I just wanted to find out the truth as soon as possible. The video was sent to me by someone else. I thought it was Diana who did that..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie hesitated to speak. She was very smart and knew what to say and what not to say. She wanted to leave some room for others to imagine so that she could preserve her good reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since it's a misunderstanding, let's not talk about it. In short, you must get a divorce from Diana and then marry Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled and said, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's face showed joy, thinking Steven still loved her in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I know you love me in your heart. Thank you for remembering your promise and being willing to marry me." Queenie was very excited in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was very satisfied with Steven's answer. This was what his son should be like. In this case, after he retired, he would live a comfortable life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't react for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did Steven agree to marry Queenie?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought Steven had changed his mind, but it turned out not to be the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan was angry and wanted to leave, but then he heard Steven's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can marry Ms. Marsh, but you have to agree to one condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew asked, "What is it?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="352.html">« Prev</a><a href="354.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
