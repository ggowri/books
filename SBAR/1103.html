Couldn't find their flight info. They might just be traveling nearby. Both of them are injured, so I doubt they'd go far."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, no matter where they are, we have more important things to handle right now. The land Diana bought is about to start construction. Didn't you say you wouldn't let her project begin? Got any good ideas?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie arrived at the land. In her previous life, it had been hers. She had developed it into a luxury resort because of the hot springs there, which attracted plenty of customers. Weekends were always packed. She ran a high-end hot spring resort, business was consistently booming, and the service was top-notch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "We absolutely can't let Diana succeed with this project. Once she does, she'll only get richer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the last thing she wanted to see happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "I get it. I've already got people watching near the site. The moment they start construction, we'll sabotage it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought for a moment. She hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t come up with a better plan yet. Only when she did could she completely defeat Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She added, "Oh, and Dylan got caught. We can use his men against Diana. They love money, so just pay them more. Make sure there</span><span>'</span><span>s no evidence left behind. Her leg isn</span><span>'</span><span>t fully healed yet, right? Then break it. I want her ruined for life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario chuckled, "Alright, I'll take care of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana made lunch for Steven, filled with dishes they both loved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven got to enjoy the spicy crab linguine he</span><span>'</span><span>d been craving. He said it was the best crab linguine he</span><span>'</span><span>d ever had.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s favorite was spicy crab linguine. She used to make it for herself all the time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the afternoon, the weather cleared up, and the temperature started to rise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s hand as they went out for a walk. Since neither of their legs had fully healed, Steven decided against going somewhere far for a vacation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all these years of being busy, he wanted to give himself a few days off&mdash;to win Diana back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven led her toward the beach to watch the sunset. "Diana, the sunset here is stunning. The endless ocean ahead, the white sandy beach&mdash;it</span><span>'</span><span>s going to be beautiful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I grew up by the sea. Sunsets, sunrises... I</span><span>'</span><span>m used to them," Diana said, her eyes on the distant ocean as she gave him a faint, forced smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She preferred the dawn&mdash;it symbolized a new beginning, a fresh start, something that felt entirely different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Sorry, I thought you</span><span>'</span><span>d like it. Most girls love sunsets and sunrises."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "A lot of girls do love romantic views like this, but I</span><span>'</span><span>m up at six and in bed by eleven. Every day</span><span>'</span><span>s exhausting&mdash;I don</span><span>'</span><span>t really have time for this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it</span><span>'</span><span>s summer, I can catch the sunrise early. And honestly, watching the moon at night makes me happier than sunsets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Was it that tough for you growing up?" Steven asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never heard her talk about her childhood before. It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t until later that he realized just how remarkable she was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That kind of brilliance comes from years of hard work. There</span><span>'</span><span>s no such thing as a born genius&mdash;what people call genius is built with time and relentless learning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked out at the distant sea and said, "Tobias, Julius, Hubery, Grandpa, and I used to live on the islands out at sea. It was a life completely cut off from the world."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa handed the company over to professionals to manage. I never had to worry about money. He raised us really well from a young age."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But when I was 17, I met you. After saving you, I became a fool, completely focused on you. The rest, you already know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I spent most of my childhood at school. I had three brothers and Grandpa to protect and love me. My childhood was pretty good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because my life was so good, when Grandma told me about your past, my heart ached for you. I put all my focus on you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and said, "But now I understand why Helen and Edward cared for me so much. Looking back, meeting you might have been fate&mdash;or maybe a carefully planned accident."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even want to go there that day. But my grandpa told me there was a fish pond near the villa area. He said the fish there tasted great and asked me to buy some."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I listened to him. When I passed by the villa, I saw the fire. That</span><span>'</span><span>s when I ran in to save you. In the end, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t get the fish, but I got a scar on my back instead. Steven, do you even know how much a burn hurts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The searing pain of the burn was something she could never forget.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, she lay on the hospital bed, but all she could think about was Steven's pale face. After being discharged, she immediately started asking around about him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time Diana thought about the past, it broke her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked deeply guilty. "I know. My arm was burned back then too. It hurt so much. I understand how it feels. Diana, thank you for saving me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder, after Diana filed for divorce, Leopold made a special trip to his office to tell him it was Diana who saved him back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had thought it was Queenie who saved his life. Later, he found out it was actually Queenie and Charlie who tried to kill him. He had mistaken his enemies for saviors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a cold laugh. "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t need your thanks. The real issue is you couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t even recognize your savior. That</span><span>'</span><span>s truly infuriating."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "Pain, isn</span><span>'</span><span>t it? Ever since I returned to the Marsh family, those three years, I lost all hope. I endured the darkest suffering this world could offer. But every time I saw you smile at me, I never once regretted it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could risk everything for love, and she could openly admit that she had loved Steven in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking back now, she wanted to tell herself, "Diana, you were so brave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly stopped in her tracks and looked at Steven. "Steven, back then, you were exactly like the boy I dreamed of. Wearing a white shirt, with such a delicate face. Your hair was a bit longer than it is now. Even though you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t smile much and seemed so distant, I still wanted to stay by your side."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana paused for a moment, but she still couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t put that feeling into words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought for a moment and tried to explain, "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know if you</span><span>'</span><span>ve ever felt it&mdash;that extreme kind of feeling. I knew we might never work out, but I still ran toward you, fearless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was like a boy who appeared out of nowhere in her life, making her young world feel magical.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly pulled her into a hug. Diana sighed helplessly. Lately, Steven was either hugging her or pinning her down. "What do you want this time?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1102.html">« Prev</a><a href="1104.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
