"Mom, I'm your son. Why are you treating me this way? Is it because I said Diana is the adopted daughter of the Marsh family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula retorted, "Are you out of your mind? Why are you blaming others? I'm suspending your card and taking back your shares because of you and that woman downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I should thank you on behalf of Paige. Thank you for not marrying her. You can have a good life with that woman down there. You're an adult now; I don't need to control you anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hand over all the cards." Paula knew her sons well, especially the second one's devotion to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was prepared to do whatever it took for Queenie's sake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom," Frank pleaded, seeing the seriousness in Paula's expression. He was genuinely afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without money, he was powerless. He couldn't understand why his mother had become like this. "Mom, I'm getting married soon. I can't be without money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had already booked an expensive hotel for the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a word, Paula walked over, took his wallet from his bag, and removed all the cards inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, you are no longer my son, Frank. If you're getting married, find your father. I don't want to care about you anymore," Paula said with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've raised you into your twenties. You're on your own from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's eyes narrowed as he stared at the cards in her hand. His gaze turned icy and detached. "Mom, are you really going to do this to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula caught the intense glare from Frank, a look so reminiscent of Jeff's. She instinctively took a step back. With her fists balled tightly at her sides, she declared, "Yes! You've heard about what your father did with those other women at Jace's banquet, right? I'm going to divorce him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, Dad knows he was wrong. That night, it was all planned by Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have proof?" Paula interrupted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, everything in the past had something to do with Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out! All of you make me worry. Just leave me alone!" Paula collapsed to the ground, sobbing in anguish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been deceived for twenty years, and at this moment, her heart was shattered beyond repair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank watched her cry in pain, and a flicker of remorse crossed his handsome features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you to leave this house, didn't I? Go away. I don't want to see you," Paula said, her emotions running high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was at a loss for words. He thought he'd come back tomorrow when his mother had calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, don't be sad. I will definitely be happy. Once you see how happy I am, you'll accept Elsie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula slowly stood up and sneered, "You've got a few thousand dollars left on your card. Once that's gone, with no job and no food, how will you manage your dating life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've spent nearly two million dollars on her in a year. Without your money, she probably wouldn't give you the time of day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, if you walk out of here today, you're not coming back. When you see me in the future, don't call me mom. I am not your mom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since he had the money to hire internet trolls to frame Diana, Paula would no longer care about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His entertainment company was on shaky ground, and its survival was dependent on his abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank contemplated the root of the problem. With a huff, he realized it was Diana again. He turned and stormed out, determined to confront Diana and settle the score.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="262.html">« Prev</a><a href="264.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
