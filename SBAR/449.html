"Enough! I'm not bailing out your company. Remember what I told you before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've cut all ties with the Marsh family. I've never interfered in your lives, and whether you sink or swim is none of my business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula said tearfully, "Diana, that's not what I meant. I'll find a way to pay off my debts. I heard you're buying land today, but that plot has no value. I'm just worried you're making a mistake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at her daughter with guilt-ridden eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mrs. Marsh, choose your words carefully. I don't have a mother. And what I do is none of your concern."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How annoying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This really ruined her morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula felt her heart shatter. "Diana, I'm only trying to help..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, she doesn't even see you as her mom. Why are you begging her? If she makes a bad investment, that's her problem. It has nothing to do with us. Don't come crying to us for money later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes turned venomous as he looked at Diana. "I shouldn't have shown her mercy last night. I should've just sold her out for a fortune. Could've bought myself a sweet racing car with that money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula stared at him in utter shock, tears instantly streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula struck his face, crying out in fury, "You monster! She's your sister! How could I have raised such a beast?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, she's just a worthless brat. Living in our house with all these luxuries is already more than she deserves. Plus, she's always trying to hurt Queenie..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, from this day forward, you four brothers are no longer my sons. I don't have such vicious children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whatever happens to you in the future is none of my concern."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Paula walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, Mom, how can you abandon me? Weren't we supposed to deal with Diana together? We're on the same side! How did this become my fault?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Paula left without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was livid enough to kill someone. He turned to confront Diana, but she had already gone inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he was about to follow her, Queenie called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face instantly lit up. "Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie spoke in her sweet, gentle voice. "Eric, do you know Mr. Morrison? I need a favor."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="448.html">« Prev</a><a href="450.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
