Seriously, who's acting out here... Wait, no, you're just blind. All you ever see is me causing trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But honestly, I don't get you. You've got everything. Looks, money, charm and yet, you insist on doing things that make people sick at the sight of you. What's the deal?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, right! Every chance you get, you're performing your deep love for Queenie. How could you possibly miss an opportunity like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's pretty face was full of sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt a deep sense of helplessness; he could never out-argue Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Harry has been sentenced. You're fine now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Fine?" Diana's face turned icy in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt a sudden pang in his chest. "Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Shut up! I'm still your wife, and your wife was framed and humiliated. And all you have to say is, 'stop making a fuss'?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just a simple 'you're fine'? Is this how you behave as a husband?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, you don't deserve me. Be at the Courthouse tomorrow at 9 AM to finalize the divorce. Then you can lock yourself down with your 'beloved' Queenie, the girl so charming that even cars blow their tires just to avoid her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"At least that'll stop her from crying like she's lost her parents every day and throwing tantrums in front of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, no one's life is easy. I've struggled and fought since I was young, but I never complained. I've been good to everyone in this family because I chose to, even if it meant being foolish. So when they humiliated me and threatened to cut ties, I was able to walk away without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I may have wronged many people, but I have never wronged you, Steven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, when she saved him from the fire, her back was covered in scars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She nearly destroyed herself for this man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why do people keep making the same mistakes? It's simple. The last time wasn't painful enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She glanced over at Queenie, whose face was pale, likely from the shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, I hope you remain Steven's precious girl forever. Hold onto your secrets. Don't let yourself become the bloodstain on his heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She turned to Steven, a flash of pain in her beautiful eyes, but her voice remained calm. "Steven, you married the red rose but still long for the white one. You're the most shameless of all! If you love Queenie, then be with her, truly. Don't drag me into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I understand that you married me for the inheritance. I loved you, willingly married you, thinking I could warm your heart. But all I got in return was humiliation, pain, and endless waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now that your precious girl is back, just divorce me and marry her already."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, I told you before, it's 'till death, not divorce,'" Steven insisted, confused. He had already admitted his mistakes, so why was Diana still holding on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie nearly fainted with anger at hearing this. She looked at Steven in pain. "Steven, what did you tell me when I left?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And what did you do after you left? What did you do to my wife? You had her kidnapped. Today, you brought reporters to expose her, dragging her through the mud. Queenie, I tolerated you because of the debt I owed you for saving my life, but this is going too far."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at Steven, puzzled. "Debt for saving your life? What life-saving debt?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="145.html">« Prev</a><a href="147.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
