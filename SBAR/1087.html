Where are </span><span>we going</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Relax." Steven's hands flexed on the wheel.&nbsp;</span><span>"Evan and Dalton are handling things at the company. You don</span><span>'</span><span>t need to worry</span><span> about it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow. "What about the special medication?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tom</span><span>'</span><span>s got it covered</span><span>."</span><span> </span><span>Steven replied, his voice steady.</span><span> "</span><span>Everything else is </span><span>handled</span><span>. You just need to relax.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at her, then back at the road.</span><span> </span><span>"We're not going back to my grandpa's place tonight. They might actually be happier that way. They need time to sort out the story. Maybe in a few days, they'll have it all figured out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana</span><span>'s </span><span>anxiety lingered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m </span><span>still </span><span>worried. I suspect there</span><span>'</span><span>s a mole in my lab."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was worried</span><span>, but fatigue </span><span>had set in that</span><span> </span><span>morning. </span><span>She decided to deal with it later after </span><span>resting</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "You already sent Joseph to investigate. Don</span><span>'</span><span>t you trust </span><span>him?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana did trust Joseph</span><span>'</span><span>s abilities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way, she had reminded Joseph to investigate everyone in the lab and make sure to find the mole.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "No, that</span><span>'</span><span>s not right. Queenie knows you</span><span>'</span><span>re still alive now, </span><span>so </span><span>she</span><span>'</span><span>ll definitely </span><span>try and make money off it somehow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just heard Andrew say George and Queenie already got married abroad. </span><span>If an</span><span>ything</span><span> happens to George, she can use him to keep expanding.</span><span> </span><span>If we leave, we</span><span>'</span><span>re just giving Queenie the perfect opportunity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smirked and asked, "You planning </span><span>on </span><span>taking George</span><span>'</span><span>s company from her?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"God, no."</span><span> </span><span>Diana shook her head.</span><span> </span><span>"I just </span><span>can't let</span><span> Queenie keep getting stronger. We</span><span>'</span><span>ve uncovered the Mysterium Organization, but </span><span>we </span><span>don</span><span>'</span><span>t know which company</span><span>'</span><span>s backing Queenie.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand how Steven could leave so calmly, wondering if everything was under his control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought they should take advantage of Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s moves and investigate her thoroughly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, someone will handle the Queenie situation. Can we not talk about work right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's expression was cold. He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to talk about work</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>h</span><span>e was irritated at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His emotions had no outlet, leaving him unbearably restless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine! Then we won</span><span>'</span><span>t talk. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll take a nap. Wake me when we get there, so I</span><span>'</span><span>ll have the energy to drink with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana closed her eyes and went to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven let out a helpless smile, thinking she had really changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he would make her become the Diana who loved him deeply once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven drove out of the city, heading straight to the private island he had purchased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie froze when she found out Steven wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no idea how long she sat there until Mario wrapped his arms around her from behind. Snapping back to reality, she looked at him, trembling. "Steven's alive!" she whispered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario let out a cold laugh. "Queenie, he's alive for now. But we can make him die again. </span><span>He won't</span><span> be lucky enough to survive next time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was stunned. George </span><span>might be </span><span>useless, but Steven wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, Steven hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t died; he</span><span>'</span><span>d been hiding in the shadows, investigating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of it sent chills down her spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next time Steven appeared in front of Queenie, it would likely mean he had uncovered the whole truth. That might just be the end of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt a sharp pain in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said</span><span> </span><span>through gritted teeth.</span><span> </span><span>"No, Mario. We need to move faster, transfer everything under our name. That</span><span>'</span><span>s the only way we can stand a chance against Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fury inside her burned hot. </span><span>They had actually been outplayed by Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had found it odd before&mdash;Diana loved Steven so much, yet after the divorce, she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t seem hurt at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turns out, she had realized long ago that George wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie closed her eyes in pain. The Diana she always looked down on kept surprising her, </span><span>again and</span><span> again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If </span><span>Andrew wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t dead, Jenny must be fine too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sending Jenny to the mental hospital back then, Queenie never visited her again. </span><span>But now, Queenie realized&mdash;</span><span>it was Steven who </span><span>had </span><span>made her send Jenny there, </span><span>all part of his plan </span><span>to keep her safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Queenie thought about it, the more panicked she became. Steven had been good to her before, all just to protect Diana and Jenny.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was furious. She hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t been outplayed by anyone else in the Gellar family, but by Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was lost in thought when suddenly, Mario's hand </span><span>slid </span><span>under her shirt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned slightly. "Mario."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, you need to keep your promise. You know I've been waiting for this day for so long," Mario said softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to</span><span>, but she was irritated&mdash;irritated with herself, with the situation, and with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario knew exactly what she was thinking. He smiled and said, "Queenie, no matter how busy you are, it can wait until tomorrow. It's dark now, just be patient. By tomorrow morning, everything will be yours. Trust me.</span><span> </span><span>I've never let you down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie didn't respond right away. Mario was handsome, and his words, mixed with his charm, made her hesitate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stood up, "Let's go home first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario shook his head, ref</span><span>using. "No, I like </span><span>it here, in </span><span>the office."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's face darkened</span><span> slightly</span><span>, but Mario</span><span>'</span><span>s touch was deliberate, skilled, and his persistence was starting to wear her down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leaned in closer, his hands moving with confident precision, and she felt a flush creeping up her neck. Her body betrayed her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a heat building inside her that she couldn't deny, and before she realized it, she was already responding to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She </span><span>forced a smile at him, trying to convince herself.</span><span> He </span><span>wouldn't </span><span>betray her. </span><span>I</span><span>t was worth it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As things progressed, Queenie quickly got caught up in the moment. Mario was fit&mdash;she felt his firm waist beneath her touch, and a shiver ran down her spine. Her breath quickened, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body, so much better than George</span><span>'</span><span>s... it was hard to resist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario had </span><span>wanted </span><span>Queenie for so long. Holding her now, he wished he could keep her tangled with him forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intensity of the moment took over, and their breaths mingled in the darkness, completely lost in each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours later, Steven's car was already on the ferry.</span><span> </span><span>He and Diana were still sitting in the driver's seat.</span><span> </span><span>Diana was still asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watch</span><span>ed</span><span> h</span><span>er sleep</span><span>, his eyes soft.</span><span> </span><span>There was something calming about watching her rest, her peaceful expression in contrast to the usual chaos of their lives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The night air on the island was </span><span>crisp, and it had a chill to it that seemed to seep into the car.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana woke up directly from the cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sat up abruptly, </span><span>her eyes blinking as she tried to make sense of her surroundings. The world outside the car was pitch black, with only the distant stars illuminating the night sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced around again, noticing they were on a ferry now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana rubbed her eyes, her voice still groggy. "</span><span>Where are we going? Do we really need to go this far just to </span><span>have a </span><span>drink?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, they could</span><span>'</span><span>ve just gone to any bar nearby for a drink.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1086.html">« Prev</a><a href="1088.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
