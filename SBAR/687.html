It is what happens when you offend me. I warned you not to fight with me, not to compete with me, and not to covet things that don't belong to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I move my hands and say something, someone will deal with you for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had already clicked to record.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you killed Mrs. Foliot, and you just wanted to frame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, "I don't know who killed her. As for who will frame you, ask yourself who you have offended."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew it was her. "Queenie, why do you have to hide it like this? I just saw your mother. She was still wearing the same clothes she wore last night. Mrs. Foliot exposed your mother's affairs, so your mother killed Mrs. Foliot to vent her anger. It is a better reason than my revenge on the Marsh family, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already returned the Marsh family and Steven to you. You still scheme against me again and again. If that's the case, don't blame me for exposing you as a mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter whether you and Steven are truly in love, you are the mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will send the photos you sent me to the media right now and present my marriage license with Steven. I'll let those who like you see how filthy and dirty you really are."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was so angry that she smashed her phone. She looked gloomy and said, "If it's exposed, Steven must marry me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought about it. Then, she picked up the phone on the ground and sent a message to Diana: [Diana, I am pregnant with Steven's child. Steven is going to marry me. Go to hell.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana saw the news and narrowed her eyes. She thought, "Queenie is pregnant with Steven's child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, Diana's heart ached to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't stop crying immediately. Thinking of her unborn child in her previous life, she felt sorry for the baby because she had failed to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt so uncomfortable that she couldn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna looked at Diana worriedly. "Diana, I will go and deal with this matter now. Don't be sad."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head in despair and said, "No. Let the bullet fly for a while. Mrs. Foliot is fine. But she hasn't woken up yet. The Foliot family has already reported the case to the police. I will be summoned by the police soon. If they can frame me, it means they have made a foolproof plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go to the police station, and you go find Tom. Keep the news that Mrs. Foliot is not dead secret. Tom knows what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's beautiful eyes were full of anger. "Okay, Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Diana finished speaking, she saw some policemen walking towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana opened the car door and got out. The police also recognized Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said, "Are you Diana Bishop? We have received a report that you are involved in a murder case. Please cooperate with our investigation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Okay! I will go back with you to accept the investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Diana was taken into the police car. Luna was furious. She thought, "Damn it, Queenie, how dare you always plot against Diana secretly?" Luna drove to find Tom.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Steven came out of the meeting, Evan looked at him nervously and said, "Mr. Gellar, something bad has happened to Mrs. Gellar. Someone reported that Mrs. Gellar killed Mrs. Foliot last night. Please check the news now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's face was cold. He looked at the tablet handed over by Evan and the news. He said coldly, "It was Queenie. She wanted to clear herself. Diana was with me and Cecil last night. How could she kill someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned. "Mr. Gellar, why were the three of you together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How could it be?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="686.html">« Prev</a><a href="688.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
