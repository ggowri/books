Now you're saying it's over, just like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, "Yes, I came to you first. I saw your pain. I saw you are not happy. I understood your past and felt sympathy and love for you. Even though you are cold to me, I foolishly wanted to stay by your side. But then I realized you don't need my love. You need Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, stop calling me and don't come to my house again. I don't want anything, so your threats mean nothing to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Tobias' company, if you dare to touch it, it'll only make me hate you more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already hate you enough. The winter is already bitterly cold. So, please, don't make my heart any colder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana hung up the phone. The sharp pain in her chest forced her to close her eyes. She tried her best to suppress the searing ache deep inside, but it still snuck up on her, leaving her gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood up and looked out the window. The distant scenery was a blur, but her mood lifted a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana checked the time and figured Cecil would be arriving soon. Smiling, she went downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren stood at the foot of the staircase. "Ms. Bishop, it's snowing. How about switching the dinner to casseroles?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded with a smile. "Sounds good. Has Mr. Farley arrived?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's almost here. I've already arranged everything for dinner," Daren replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and nodded again. Moments later, Cecil walked in, carrying a basket filled with ripe figs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana beamed with joy. She could tell just by looking that they were sweet. Perfect for dessert after dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, come and sit. It must be freezing outside," Diana smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled, "Not too bad. Once I'm inside, it's not cold at all." He took off his coat, revealing a crisp white shirt beneath. His grin was carefree, brimming with youth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled and pointed to the casserole dish. "Lobster casserole. Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's eyes lit up as he gazed at the spread of exquisite dishes on the table, his face beaming with delight. "Diana, this looks amazing! I don't always get to have these deep-sea delicacies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gestured toward the cutlery. "Well, dig in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! I'm starving. After I got back, I sat through four meetings and cranked out an hour on my thesis without even a sip of water. I'm completely drained." Cecil suddenly looked up at Diana, his expression serious. "Diana, I'm just now realizing that being rich's not easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback. She knew that feeling all too well. Smiling, she replied, "Being rich isn't easy because you spend every day chasing after money. Your parents hardly had time for you when you were young. In order to make your life better, they were always out there, chasing projects and deals, giving all their time to money. Does it feel like that to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said, "That's exactly it, Diana. I used to feel so lonely as a kid, so I'd round up some trouble-making friends and go racing. But I was never really good at it. Anyway, once you have money, you can have anything you want, and racing was the only thing that really interested me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the Farley Group was in trouble, Cecil hadn't raced ever since. If he kept playing around, the company's problems would only worsen, and he might not even be able to maintain a decent life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Cecil worked with his father and managed the company properly, things would get better over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Cecil understood. Life was always about trade-offs. Giving up his passion meant his family could thrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, outside the villa, Steven glanced at the front gate, his expression grim and unreadable. He thought, "She let Cecil in, but not me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="520.html">« Prev</a><a href="522.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
