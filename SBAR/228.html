The hours of surgery were excruciating for him.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing that it was Paula's voice, he immediately opened his eyes and saw her gazing at him tearfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula wiped her tears and said, "Gale, I'll take you to see a good show, and then you'll know how wrong you are.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Afterwards, let's sever ties with each other. Your stupidity will kill you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula called the bodyguards to push a wheelchair over and asked them to lift Gale into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was serious. Gale instantly panicked. "Mom, I didn't give you the shares. It was my fault, but I wanted Penelope and our baby to live a better life. She is pregnant with my child, which is also your grandchild..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up! I don't want to hear your nonsense. Whatever you hear or see, be quiet. Go abroad in three days. Your life depends on your luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula instructed the bodyguards to wheel the drowsy Gale out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the emergency exit not far away, Penelope glared at Queenie. "Queenie, Gale is disabled now. Do you want me to marry him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, was it really Diana who injured his legs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie cast a cold, sharp glance at her and said arrogantly, "It doesn't matter whether it was Diana or not. Most importantly, they had a conflict three days ago, and Gale sent her design drawings to Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana wished Gale would die, and this was her motive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Moreover, Penelope, you aren't pregnant with his child at all. I help you find a father for the baby, so you should just restrain yourself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you question me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope sneered, "It seems that I am also your pawn. Half a year ago, you used me to frame Diana and Althea..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Penelope, shut up. I did that for your own good. Gale gives you a huge sum of money every month as pocket money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you spent it on supporting your gigolo. Now, Gale's disabled. You should take good care of him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, I will marry Gale on the condition that he is healthy and can make money for me, but he is now disabled. What can he give me? Nothing. I will give birth to the baby in my belly. At worst, I will raise him myself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want me to serve a cripple? Dream on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope turned around and left angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sneered and went directly to the first floor to see the investigation into Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's face was in tears. He trembled all over. Great pain and sorrow overwhelmed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that everything was a carefully planned scam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ones who did him harm were Queenie and Penelope, but not Diana and Althea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why was Penelope, a lively and lovely girl, so cruel to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was really, really stupid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope even used his money to support a gigolo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale, unable to bear such a blow, fainted, tears at the corners of his eyes. It was not known whether this was due to physical or psychological pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula wept silently. She beckoned the bodyguards over and asked them to take Gale back to the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Downstairs, Diana and Luna were assisting the police with their investigation.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="227.html">« Prev</a><a href="229.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
