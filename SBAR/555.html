And their bites hurt all the more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff looked away, guilt etched on his face. "Paula, it's not that I don't want to help, but I can't afford it. Let's get divorced. I know you love me; if you do, you won't drag me down, right? I'll give you ten thousand dollars, and when you're older, I'll keep helping you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula let out a short, hollow laugh, sinking to the floor. She shook with the pain she could no longer contain. This was the man she had loved, the one she'd sacrificed for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a fish gasping out of water, but no matter how she struggled, she could not resist the burning pain in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her collapse, Jeff felt a pang of sympathy. After two decades, he couldn't say he felt nothing for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knelt down, resting a hand on her shoulder. "Paula, don't worry. Everything will be okay. You'll get through this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her blurred vision, Paula looked at him, barely able to make out his face in her tear-soaked haze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every memory of his deception rose within her like flames licking at her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there, beside him, stood Queenie, her smirk filled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Queenie only deepened Paula's sorrow, her body trembling as she sobbed uncontrollably. "Jeff, how could you do this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Paula," he sighed, exasperated. "This wasn't easy for me, but when life gets tough, everyone has to look out for themselves. We only get one shot at life, don't we? Let's keep it simple. Tomorrow, let's finalize the divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sat there crying, her face pale, her body drained of strength. She couldn't even bring herself to move. The ache seeped through every nerve in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, her phone buzzed. She wiped away her tears and answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Jace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, I heard you sold the company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Jace. It was a losing battle; I had no choice." She tried to steady herself, her face a mask of composure. Even Queenie felt a bit of pity for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had always been a devoted mother, raising Queenie with the utmost care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Paula knew Queenie wasn't her real daughter, she might not care for her that much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, I sympathize with you, but let's get practical. You still owe me two hundred million. How are you going to pay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, Jace, give me some time. I'll gather the one billion I need for the bank first, then I'll pay you back. I have my father's assets, which can be sold for five hundred million. I'll make this right. I just need some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace sighed. "Paula, I don't want to sound harsh, but you've lost billions already. I need you to pay back the money as soon as possible. You're bankrupt know. Another twenty years won't turn this around. You're getting older; how much longer can you try to claw your way back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, my two hundred million is crucial for me too. I hear Jeff's company hasn't sold yet. Maybe start there? Sell it off and pay me back. We used to be business partners, but not any more. I hate to be the one to say it, but I was doing this out of respect for your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that his estate is liquidated, you're out of resources. So, Paula, I'll give you one more week."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula tried to respond, but the line had already gone dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jace, wait! You can't take Jeff's company! He is just a freeloader. He can't survive without it!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="554.html">« Prev</a><a href="556.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
