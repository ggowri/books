"Why should I attend your wedding? Elsie has framed me countless times. She's so malicious, and you expect me to give my blessings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you think I would come?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige had no interest in Frank anymore. She now realized that when a woman lived her own fabulous life, she naturally attracted men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had wasted six years on Frank, her biggest regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie glared fiercely at Paige. She had won, but she felt like she had lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was more stunning than ever and came from a good family background.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie had always been envious of Paige, so she schemed against her. If she hadn't, she wouldn't have ended up with Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how poor Frank was, he could provide her with a worry-free life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who had never experienced poverty could never understand her feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank gazed at Paige's exquisite features. In just a year, she had truly become even more beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, she cared about him wholeheartedly, but now she only regarded him with indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, she would see other men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That man was Diana's brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">True love couldn't be hidden, and eyes never lied. In the past, Paige's eyes always trailed Frank, full of affection. But now, those eyes only held coldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was hard for Frank to accept this change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "Paige, I know you have a misunderstanding about Elsie. I sent you the invitation just to show you that we are living a happy life, and Elsie is not as terrible as you believe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These words cut deep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige's hatred towards Elsie was palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige said, "Frank, whether or not you and Elsie decide to get married is none of my business. You don't need to do it just for my sake. Even if you have children, it doesn't concern me. How dare you send me a wedding invitation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank grinned slyly, "I simply wanted you to share in our joy. Without you, Elsie and I will still be happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've kept my distance for a year. Aren't you both happy? You're flaunting your love in front of me. Come on, keep it to yourselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard you were kicked out by your mother. Frank, you've been gone for a year, and I've been working hard in that time. You're out of my league now, so stay away from me from now on," Paige retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank meant nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige felt that she had changed significantly in the past year and no longer subconsciously paid attention to anything related to Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She followed financial news and the stock market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It took her only a year to move on from the man she had loved for six years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A woman who did foolish things for a selfish man was truly foolish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, she realized it in time and cut her losses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige, you...you are my good friend..." Frank stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige questioned, "What kind of friend am I to you? Frank, you disgust me. If you didn't like me, you could have rejected me, but you wanted to have it both ways. You enjoyed my care while pursuing Elsie. I regret ever liking a jerk like you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even though I loved you, I have never regretted what I did for you. I am brave, sincere, and sensible. I have done nothing wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who are you to ask me to come to your wedding? Don't you simply want me to witness your happiness? You are happy now, you have gotten what you wanted, and I have been away from you for a year. What else are you dissatisfied with?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="285.html">« Prev</a><a href="287.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
