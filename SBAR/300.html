It seemed that Steven no longer paid all his attention to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven began to care about Diana. He was afraid that something might happen to her, so he canceled the international conference and came to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie knew that Steven was not as attentive to her as before, which was why she came to please Steven early in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was powerful in Capitole. If Queenie lost him, it would be like losing a ready source of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was well-known that Steven doted on Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was revealed today that Diana was Queenie's stepping stone. Many people thought this matter would not continue to spread because Diana's influence was still too small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The capitalists would not allow Diana to ruin Queenie, who was still valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone in the circle knew how outstanding Queenie was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan followed Steven back to the company and continued to prepare for the video conference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, the public relations department of Foliot Group issued a statement: [Regarding the conflict between Frank and Diana, which escalated to the film's female lead, Queenie, this matter has nothing to do with Queenie.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately afterward, Frank recorded a video in which he said that he and Diana had some minor problems and that he said those words in order to embarrass her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He apologized in the video. "I'm sorry to have made such a bad influence because of what I said in a temper. I sincerely apologize to everyone. It's Diana trick. She caused this incident. I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank put all the blame on Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank and Queenie seemed to be innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, netizens didn't stop discussing it. For a while, they only accused Frank and forgot about Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the solution that Jace came up with. Frank was the culprit in this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as Frank clarified, all netizens' attention would be on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Surprisingly, Queenie even gained more than one million followers in this matter and became famous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's reputation was saved. She smiled happily and thought, "Fortunately, I asked Jace for help. The trending topics were suppressed by the Foliot Group's public relations department. The power of capitalists is always the strongest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Jace's power, this matter was ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank saw the public opinion and then looked at Queenie sitting next to him. He felt very depressed. "Queenie, your reputation is saved, but my company has collapsed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank founded the company himself. When it was thriving, Elsie wanted to let him work harder and then left because Frank's mother disagreed with their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank had been chasing Elsie that year, so the company didn't have much development.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled and said, "Frank, you still have me. This film will definitely be a big hit. I'll open a company for you then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Frank lost his company, he still had real estate and shares. He wouldn't live a terrible life, but he thought something was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was depressed, and Queenie left happily. This time, Frank put himself down, and Queenie didn't have to take action at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank still wanted to save his precarious company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took the company's artists to look for collaboration. He didn't care about the netizens' curses to him. What mattered was that he defeated Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Frank was not as happy as he had imagined. He was helpless when he thought of Diana's desperate and angry eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just wanted to make his family happy and peaceful, but Diana's appearance made it full of chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula abandoned Frank, and netizens scolded him. Seeing these comments, Frank didn't make any rebuttal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He comforted himself in his heart. "As long as Queenie is fine, I don't mind being scolded. Only she is my sister. Diana has been taken away since she was born, and she can only blame herself for being unlucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Frank was in distress, he suddenly received a call from Jace. After listening to what Jace said, Frank happily went to find him.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="299.html">« Prev</a><a href="301.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
