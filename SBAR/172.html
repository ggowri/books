If she's in, then I won't participate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I'll leave her speechless when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana didn't have time to wallow in sadness; feeling sorry for someone like Gale was simply not worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, and when Diana opened them again, clarity filled her gaze. What she needed was to grow stronger&mdash;strong enough to compete with Steven and that man behind Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pulling out her tablet, she focused on the latest financial reports, her expression serious and intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Gale stood downstairs, replaying the events of the morning in his mind. His anger had been sparked by Queenie returning home in tears, claiming she had been wronged by Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had stormed over to confront her, but now, the more he thought about it, the more uneasy he felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was his sister, after all. She had been abandoned at birth, and they still hadn't found the person responsible for that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had a point when she said that, as a baby, she couldn't choose her circumstances. But that didn't give them the right to hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fuming, Gale returned home just as their mother, Paula, walked in, looking exhausted from a long day at work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey, Gale! You rushed out earlier. What's up?" Queenie greeted him, her eyes still puffy from crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale's heart ached at the sight. "I went to teach Diana a lesson. I tore up her designs. That country bumpkin thinks she can play at being an artist? Please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A flicker of amusement crossed Queenie's face, but she quickly masked it with concern. "Gale, you shouldn't have done that! I know you meant well, but those designs were really important to her. We need to respect every designer's work. If I'd known you were going to do something like that, I would've stopped you. Now Diana is going to hate me even more, and she'll make my life a living hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale waved her off. "Don't worry, Queenie. I'm here to protect you. She won't dare lay a finger on you. You look tired; why don't you head upstairs and rest?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie nodded obediently, but a sly smile crept onto her face as she climbed the stairs. She had just come back from Steven's place and had run into Gale as he was heading out. She had told him how Diana had been bothering Steven, which had made her cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ahe thought smugly, "Serves you right, Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Getting bullied by your own brother must sting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I've studied design too, and it's high time I showed Diana who's really the best. I'll stomp on her and prove to Steven that I'm the perfect woman for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she passed Paula, she greeted Paula quickly before heading upstairs to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought to herself, "I've done my homework&mdash;the company is experiencing some issues, but nothing too serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Honestly, what's with Paula's melodramatic act? Who is she trying to impress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula stood up, her expression serious. "Gale, come with me. We need to talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale noticed the gravity in her eyes and felt a knot form in his stomach. "What's going on?" He recalled their last conversation, thinking, "Why do I feel like Mom has changed? Or is company's issues making her concern about Queenie less?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He followed his mother outside and headed to a nearby park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The morning air was bustling with activity and felt refreshing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The square was alive with music blaring loudly, filled with all sorts of people engaged in various activities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The autumn breeze was cool, and Gale found his mood lifting slightly as he faced it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale smiled, "Mom, are you taking me for a stroll in the park?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's eyes turned cold as she stopped in a secluded area, away from prying eyes. "No! You went find Diana and told her to drop out of the competition? And you tore up her designs?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="171.html">« Prev</a><a href="173.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
