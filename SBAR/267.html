My granddaughter never dared to wear backless clothes to save you. When the beam fell, she shielded you, and her entire back was scorched by the fire. After you were rescued, you vanished without even a 'thank you'.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sign this now. My granddaughter fancies young, handsome men. An old geezer like you is perfect for Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold was imperious, wielding the divorce papers and demanding Steven's signature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nothing would stand in the way of Diana's happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood, exclaiming, "Sir Bishop, I won't divorce Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold's face turned crimson with rage. "What do you mean? My granddaughter nearly lost her life twice because of you. What more do you want from her? Do you want her dead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Steven could respond, Leopold continued, "Let me tell you, even if you die, Diana will not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If she hadn't been head over heels for you all these years, do you really think your company would've sailed so smoothly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I would've taken you out, along with the entire scummy Marsh family, a long time ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that she's finally ready to leave you, you scumbag, there's no way I'm letting you off the hook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sign it!" Leopold was resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's vision darkened, and he fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He found himself at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his gaze to Evan. "Is your boss really that weak?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan furrowed her brow. He couldn't grasp which situation Leopold was referring to where Steven appeared weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was clueless about whether Steven was weak in bed or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But right now, Steven focused on tracking down the man who looked exactly like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan spoke slowly, "Sir Bishop, Mr. Gellar was forced into unconsciousness because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold stamped his foot in frustration, unable to resist berating Steven, "You good-for-nothing, can't even handle a little shock. Diana must be blind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't shoulder any burden. What's the difference between you and a complete waste?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just look at Alexander. He's got this commanding vibe, with broad shoulders and a strong build, the ideal inverted triangle figure that makes girls swoon. His abs are like something out of a magazine, and the way he strides feels like he's ready to conquer the world. Even if a boulder plummeted from the heavens, he'd stand unfazed. That's exactly the kind of man Diana is into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you see the scandal last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold eyed Evan, who was holding Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan shook his head and then nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold was exasperated. "What's with all the nodding and head-shaking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Bishop, I'm not sure what scandal you're referring to," Evan said, finding Leopold oddly endearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite his age, Leopold was in fantastic shape, full of energy, and had a kind heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was the gossip about Diana and Alexander last night. How did you miss it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold then asked with a smile, "Diana is stunning, and Alexander is dashing. Aren't they a perfect match?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="266.html">« Prev</a><a href="268.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
