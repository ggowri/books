"Alex..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback to find Steven standing there and quickly stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frowning, she asked, "Steven, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smirked, his expression cool and teasing. "What's wrong? Disappointed it's not your Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honestly, yes." Diana attempted to close the door, uncertain how he had found her, but living in this city meant he would eventually discover her whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The house wasn't in her name, so it would be difficult for him to trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the luxurious villa, Steven's gaze turned icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, is this house a gift from Nolan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had known her identity back then, he would have given her the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could have provided her with a mansion like this, yet why did she insist on hiding who she was&#65311;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, catching the mockery in his tone, smiled calmly. "Who bought it doesn't concern you. It's late, and I need to rest. Please leave, Mr. Gellar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she tried to close the door, Steven pushed it open gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stepped inside and closed the door behind him, a playful smile on his lips. "I'm your husband. Don't you think you should invite me in for a while?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt exasperated. Was he out of his mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I... don't want you here. You have no right to be in my home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was because of him helping Queenie, leading to her family's tragedy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's expression darkened, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Diana, you claim to love me, but it doesn't seem very deep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing his taunting tone caused a sharp pain in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears welled in her eyes, and she struggled to hold them back, knowing how quickly sadness could bring her to the brink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can doubt everything about me, but you cannot question my love for you over the past two years. It's been gradually extinguished by you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So I don't love you anymore. Two years ago, I turned down many opportunities to care for you. You've always been selfish, determining my fate with your words alone. You've never trusted me. I am your wife, yet you always point your finger at me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You give your best to others but refuse to offer your legitimate wife even a warm glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've said it before. Don't come looking for me unless it's about our divorce. I want no entanglements with you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You should leave now. It's too late, and I need to rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven clenched his fists tightly. "Diana, I've made mistakes in the past. How many apologies will it take for you to forgive me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did I ever tell you that you're not worthy of an apology? Until you've felt the knife in your back, you'll never understand my pain. You personally killed me once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pointed to her abdomen, a surge of emotion rising within her, but she ultimately held back and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Every time you show up, Steven, you remind me of how small I used to be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she turned and walked towards the villa, leaving him in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven would not actually hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching her furious retreat, he quietly turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Diana returned to the main hall, her phone rang with an unknown number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this Diana?" A cocky male voice came through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned. "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great! Your brother Eric lost a bet and can't pay the hundred thousand. He's asking you to come save him. Bring a million dollars, or I'll break his hands and feet and leave him a cripple for life."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="433.html">« Prev</a><a href="435.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
