Luna chuckled, incredulous. Most people cried when they divorced, but here was Diana, laughing about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana slowly lifted her gaze, revealing a breathtaking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am genuinely happy. The pain I've endured can now drift away with this divorce certificate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, it wasn't Steven who had killed her. It was the man that Queenie had brought with her today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tell by his eyes and tone that he was the one responsible for her death in that life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, her resentment toward Steven faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Steven's biggest mistake had been not loving her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "But not loving someone isn't a crime!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real mistake was my blind courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, women believe their kindness and gentleness can touch the hearts of those they love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now I understand that those who don't love you will never see your efforts or goodness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letting each other go is the best choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that weight of hatred lifted, she felt surprisingly less animosity toward Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move on. Everything here is settled. Next, Queenie and 'Mr. Gellar' will retaliate, so you all need to stay sharp," Diana urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and Joseph nodded vigorously. "Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head to the office!" Diana commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph pushed her toward the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across the street, in a building, Steven sat in his wheelchair, watching Diana's commanding presence at work. A faint smile flickered across his swollen face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing her so happy about the divorce made his heart sink, only to be replaced by a sly grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Diana is celebrating too soon. I've always said things between us are far from over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan stood nearby, watching everything unfold on the screen. "Mr. Gellar, this is priceless. Mrs. Gellar just knocked Queenie and George down a peg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never imagined she'd be this formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana left the conference room, Steven finally collected himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted in his wheelchair and gazed out the window. The foggy sky mirrored his gloomy mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just three days until Christmas and Helen away abroad, he would once again be alone for the holidays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had hoped to spend Christmas with Diana, hoping it would strengthen their bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the hope had been dashed to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes deepened with intensity. "Evan, find out why George looks exactly like me, down to his demeanor and gaze."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan had been investigating that very issue and finally arrived at a conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, I've narrowed it down to two possibilities. Cosmetic surgery, or you two are twin brothers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shook his head. "Cosmetic surgery seems more plausible. I can't possibly have a twin brother. My mother only had me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan, tapping into his imagination, said, "What if George was taken away at birth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven replied with serious tone, "No way! My mother was pregnant with only me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't think of any other explanations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, Steven suddenly asked, "Evan, have you ever heard of the Mysterium Organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's eyes widened in surprise, and he shivered slightly. "Mr. Gellar, are you talking about that secretive biotech research organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm! George may have been born there, sharing the same genes as me, which is why we look identical, but he's not my brother," Steven said, and his expression was contemplative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned. "That's right, Mr. Gellar! I remember now. There were rumors circulating over thirty years ago that the Mysterium Organization was involved in illegal genetic experiments, creating a person who looked exactly like a wealthy individual. That person ultimately took the place of the original heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought it was just a myth, but it seems they really can pull it off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's shock deepened as he connected the dots. It made sense now. George looked just like Steven, down to his voice, eyes, and even his build.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications of such an organization were terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared out the window, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The person behind this technology is said to have a daughter who's a top-tier executive. He himself is an exceptionally skilled biotech mogul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This technology has been coveted worldwide, and it's rumored that only he and his daughter understand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But his daughter was infatuated. At twenty-eight, she fell for a man who sweet-talked her and ultimately stole the technology from her. In the shadows, he established Mysterium Organization, engaging in illegal human experimentation and other nefarious research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's likely that Andrew was already connected to Mysterium Organization before I was even born, which explains the existence of someone who looks exactly like me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was taken aback, and the pieces of the puzzle fell into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Mysterium Organization was involved, it was no wonder that there were two identical Stevens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This biotech organization could create a perfect replica of a person, complete with matching personalities and tempers&mdash;making it nearly impossible to tell who was real and who was fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The incident from thirty years ago was real. Two wealthy men had looked nearly identical, and even their own daughter couldn't distinguish between her real father and the impostor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan pulled out his phone, quickly scrolling until he found a record. He always felt that Andrew had missing funds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, look at this. Here's a summary of Mr. Andrew Gellar's company's financial flow over the past twenty years. There's a staggering three billion dollars that has funneled into this account&mdash;George's location, Raventia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mysterium Organization is right on the outskirts of Raventia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes turned icy. "Just as I suspected!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze sank. "So much money doesn't add up. Could they have created other identical people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan gulped, and a chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, this is terrifying. This kind of technology is so terrifying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It posed a significant threat to the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one had managed to catch the mastermind behind Mysterium Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone could develop such technology fifty years ago, they were likely even more formidable now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's curiosity piqued. "Mr. Gellar, what kind of genius could create technology like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven brushed off the question, and focused more on another issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan, investigate Andrew. He transferred three billion dollars to someone twenty years ago and another three billion dollars ten years later. This money can't be simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's no wonder Andrew's company has stagnated for years and has been berated by Grandma for being useless. He's had nothing to say in his defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems we've been foolish, letting him pull the wool over our eyes all these years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan felt a sense of dread creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no end to the horrors they were uncovering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deeper they dug, the more outrageous it seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a bold hypothesis struck Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, is it possible that your father isn't your real father? Otherwise, I can't make sense of why he would want you dead."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="919.html">« Prev</a><a href="921.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
