She knew it was a leading brand in the baby market, and in a few years, it would become very popular.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next month, Diana planned to travel abroad to discuss becoming an agent for this brand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In two years, she knew their baby products would become a global sensation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Althea, this is the formula Gale sent, along with some baby products. It's perfect for newborns. It's made from all-natural ingredients, different from other formulas. The shelf life is also quite short, so I only got a small amount for now. After the baby is born, I'll buy larger cans."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea happily accepted the formula, and the two went upstairs together.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After helping Althea carry the items up, Diana noticed the weather was nice and wanted to go diving for some shells.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea saw through her thoughts and smiled, "Thinking of diving again?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana loved diving for spider shells. She laughed and said, "Althea, today I won't need a coach. Why don't you come with me? You can wait by the shore while I dive. The sea breeze isn't cold today, and the visibility is great. Who knows, maybe I'll find a spider shell for dinner."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two big spider shells would be enough for a full meal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea knew Diana had come for diving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Alright, grab your gear. I'll take you to a spot. The coach and others are diving over there as well. It's a rare big tide today, so there should be a lot of seafood. They've gone to search for groupers."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was excited. "Let's go. After a big tide, there should be plenty of seafood."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then she glanced at Althea's belly, feeling a bit uneasy. "Althea, maybe you should wait at home. I'll be back in about four hours. I'd feel more at ease if you stayed."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea chuckled, "I still have more than a month before I give birth. I'm not that fragile. You know, on the mountain across the island, some women are about to give birth, still working in the fields. I'm just sitting around all day. What are you so worried about? And besides, you're a doctor. If anything happens, I'll feel safe with you by my side.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But give me a moment. I'll start the rice cooker. When we come back, we can boil the crabs and have dinner right away."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Althea, I'll cook the rice. You just relax for a bit."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She placed the rice in the steamer, knowing it would stay warm after it was done cooking.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, the two set out, driving for 40 minutes to the beach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The weather was perfect, with the sun shining and a gentle breeze. Diana put on her wetsuit, asking Althea to take some pictures of her. Then, she posted a photo collage on her social media, where only her family could see it. She wanted to let Leopold know she was doing well.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After posting, she didn't see the coach and the others.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea explained that they were fishing out at sea.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana put on her diving mask, grabbed her net, and dove into the water, while Althea stood at the shore, taking pictures of her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Steven's phone, which was on the table, chimed with a notification.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He paused for a second before he quickly picked up the phone and opened Diana's post.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There she was again, wearing a wetsuit and smiling in the sunlight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's finger gently brushed across her smiling face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Last time, she had a coach with her. This time, she was alone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The black wetsuit perfectly outlined her figure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't like other men standing beside her. Pictures of her alone were much more pleasing to his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven called for Evan to come in.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, what can I do for you?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="321.html">« Prev</a><a href="323.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
