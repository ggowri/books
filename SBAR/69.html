That man was the only one she loved the most.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she didn't want to lose Steven either, the man who could protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff had no idea, so he left quietly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held the medicine in his hand, ready to have sex tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff </span><span>drove</span><span> away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the villa, Paula drove the car herself and followed Jeff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a private restaurant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Steven, Owen, and Evan walked in, they saw Diana and Luna eating here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What made Steven angry was that Alexander was also there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was purely a coincidence that Diana met Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander came to this private restaurant for dinner because of his friend's introduction. He met Diana at the door and the three of them ate together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them were chatting happily and didn't notice Steven and the others sitting behind the square pillar behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their conversation could be heard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at Diana who was eating happily. Her every move was natural and her sound was pleasing</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I heard that you have become the design director of L.Q. I am impressed by your excellence."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked confident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt that as long as there was a stage, she would shine brightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana put down her fork and smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She explained modestly, "I was forced to do it. Our company's design director was hired by the Gellar Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are the best in my heart, Mr. Powell. You work hard to shine, and I work hard to keep up with you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The moon and stars will come to you, and I will come to you too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was stunned. Was he the best in her heart?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked in a gentle tone, tentatively, "Diana, do you think of me like this? In your heart, I am the best?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander would be the richest man in the future, even Steven couldn't defeat him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he had a good character.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he was the best to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were not many men in this world who were both rich and self-disciplined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was one of them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana started to flatter him, "Of course, you are the best. I have built a castle in my heart, and only you live in the castle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seeing your handsome face, I suddenly realized that all the paintings, mountains, and rivers in this world are to pave the way for your beauty."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was overjoyed by her praise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I am so happy every time I chat with you. Why are you so sweet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and explained, "I am sweet because I am facing you and we are good friends."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She believed that Alexander would help her in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could she not feel sweet in her heart?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ah...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt sweeter than drinking honey.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's smile faded slightly because her last sentence changed the meaning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was not good at romance. Luna felt that she was redundant just now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now she came back to her senses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander restrained his smile a little and said, "Diana, their dishes are delicious, you should eat more."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled quietly and looked at her breathtaking face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you! I've already eaten a lot. You should eat too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tilted her head and looked at Luna, saying, "Luna, you should eat more too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "I'm full. You talk so much but haven't eaten much. Eat quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was actually full, and she found that she and Alexander had a lot of topics to talk about.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She and Steven met suddenly, and their relationship came to an abrupt end.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They shouldn't have been together from the beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had her last bite before saying, "I'm full, let's go back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her frank appearance and found her very cute. He asked tentatively, "Diana, it's too late. Can I take you back?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled beautifully and said, "Why don't you let us take you home?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was stunned. He smiled happily and said, "Silly girl, why should I, a grown man, need you to send me home?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her with amusement. That sincere smile was pleasing to the eyes and even more dazzling than the bright moon outside the window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, I just want to send you home." Diana expressed her determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought about it and said reluctantly, "Well, since you want to send me home so much, then I agree."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to see what she wanted to do.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="68.html">« Prev</a><a href="70.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
