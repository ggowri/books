He swiftly turned down the volume and then helped her stand up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Go wait for me over there. You're not allowed to look at these things."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana slapped his hand away and said angrily, "I just want to take a look. I haven't experienced these things before. Let me see and learn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite saying this, her cheeks were still blushing deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was furious, even wanting to teach her properly right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled her onto the sofa beside him and warned her firmly, "You're not allowed to look. If you want to experience it, as your husband, I can let you experience it properly tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was startled and looked at him warily. "You... you better not mess around."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face was very red. This time, she understood not to casually watch the hotel's night surveillance, as it was filled with moans everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat quietly on the sofa, then took out another computer, casually checking the Owen family's stock market trends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven sat down to investigate last night's surveillance. It had to be said, Diana's mastery of coding had reached an unparalleled level, effortlessly handling code and restoring various videos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she wanted to, she could become a legend in this industry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, the glitch was fixed. All the surveillance videos from last night were restored.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Queenie knew Diana wanted to stir things up, she would definitely have someone smash the surveillance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven checked the timeline and found the video of Owen being taken into the hotel by Jocelyn. With this video, Owen could clear his name. In the video, Owen was indeed unconscious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven immediately copied the video.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Queenie and George were busy buying the Toby family's stocks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Owen's branch was now hers, Queenie smiled happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting in front of the computer, she personally controlled everything with her team.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and said, "George, Owen's branch is completely ours now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George walked over, hugged her, and kissed her on the cheek. "Queenie, you're amazing. Cecil's family business is the strongest. If we acquire the Farley family's business, we'll be more than halfway to success. By then, as long as we find a chance to get rid of Diana, everything from the Gellar family will naturally fall back into my hands. That way, we'll have firmly established ourselves here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already planned a backup, but it couldn't be executed just yet. George thought, "My dad said this is too risky, and he has another way. I'll wait for my dad to carry out his plan. If it works, by the end of this year, I'll become a wealthy man everyone envies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled and continued manipulating the stock market. She could make the Toby family's stocks crash instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Diana wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t idle. Watching the Toby family's stocks crash so quickly, she knew it was Queenie's doing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she directly reported Queenie's company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She found an address, and the people there had been manipulating the Toby family's shares. So, this person could only be Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, secretly manipulating the stock market is illegal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Diana kindly provided the address to the police.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was in the middle of a critical moment manipulating the stock market, but Mario suddenly rushed in. "Ms. Marsh, the authorities are here. You need to leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Queenie was very unwilling. She continued manipulating the stock market and coldly said, "No, I'm almost there. I can successfully transfer Owen's shares to my name."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario understood her hard work. However, if she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t leave now, it would be too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouted, "Ms. Marsh, if you get caught, you'll lose everything. Manipulating the financial market is a serious violation of laws and regulations, and it leads to imprisonment. You've already secured the branch company. Leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the signal suddenly cut off, Queenie had no choice but to give up. She destroyed all the programs with one click, and then the three of them left together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time the law enforcement arrived at the scene, there was no one left inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew Queenie could escape, but she couldn't care too much. She could only rescue Owen now and let him lead his company. That way, his company wouldn't be taken by Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's tactics shocked her. She took Nick to the police station. While she was providing evidence to the police, Luna called her, saying that Owen's two branch companies had already become Queenie's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned because she knew these two branch companies were the ones Owen had previously collaborated with Queenie on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick was frightened. "Diana, I feel like these companies are just like paper in Queenie's eyes, so easy for her to take away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Do you think it's that easy? When she was working with Owen, she had already investigated everything about the company, including the shareholders, stakeholders, and the entire status of the company. She prepared a lot, so of course, she could take over the company instantly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I warned Owen last time, but he refused to believe it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana then smiled and said, "Forget it, I can't meddle in his affairs. As long as I get him out, Queenie will have one more enemy. And for us, we'll gain one more friend."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick hadn't taken Queenie seriously before. But this time, he finally realized how terrifying she could be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She usually pretends to be a delicate woman, but behind the scenes, she is incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick swallowed hard and said with a strained smile, "Diana, how exactly did she do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at his pale face, Diana smiled and said, "Queenie is truly impressive, to the point of being frightening."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick felt deeply ashamed. If he were Owen, he would have lost everything by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana comforted him, "Don't worry. As long as she doesn't target you, you'll be fine. The next person is Yanson. Though, he does need to face some challenges."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick said, "Diana, the evidence has been sent in for a long time. Can Owen be acquitted?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No. We need to bring over the ones who forced him to drink. Before they arrive, someone will threaten them harshly. Naturally, someone will tell the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Diana smiled at Nick. "Nick, Queenie couldn't have done all this alone; everyone was helping her. From Owen drinking to Jocelyn showing up and taking him to the hotel, everything was tightly connected. A drunk person can't analyze these things, so he was destined to be framed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick was stunned, thinking, "Queenie is terrifying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them waited for over ten minutes. Then, Owen's father, Diken Toby, personally brought over the men who had been making Owen drink last night and provided evidence to the police.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana, his weary eyes lit up slightly. "Ms. Bishop, thank you for helping Owen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Mr. Diken Toby, helping you is also helping myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diken asked, "I don't know if we can find Queenie. The evidence I found shows this has nothing to do with her. What exactly can we do to send this vicious woman to prison?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1066.html">« Prev</a><a href="1068.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
