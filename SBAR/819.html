This is a police station. You don't get to run the show here. I've already provided new evidence. It's you who killed my wife," Mark spoke up just as the livestream reached its peak viewership, pushing public opinion against Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him with a captivating smile, her eyes bright and alluring. "Mark, if your acting were as impressive as your intelligence, you wouldn't be standing here right now. Honestly, I think your brain might've been cut off along with your umbilical cord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Mark glared at her in frustration, fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You're just a sharp-tongued, glib..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I am indeed sharp-tongued,"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana interrupted him smoothly, "Mr. Foliot, when you try to throw dirt on me, 'truth will prevail' becomes nothing but a joke. If you're bold enough to fling mud, why shouldn't I throw it back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you won't regret your actions today. People like you just get bored too easily, don't you? Turning your spare time into an opportunity to entrap others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought to herself, "Why don't these small-minded fools spend this time making some real money? Isn't that a more secure feeling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were hypocritical, which only highlighted her innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because behind their well-dressed appearances, they were more monstrous than any ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, all of you! Stop bickering! We're still not sure Diana is the murderer, so what's the point of all this noise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A police officer shouted from behind the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked toward the officer. Today's investigation was clearly set up by Mark, who had likely arranged for reporters to document the whole thing. She decided she didn't need to do anything but wait. Once Lily arrived, all the rumors would fall apart on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still didn't know what Lily intended to do. Diana had come here today to demand justice from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Lily's family matters, that would be up to her to resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer addressed her, "Ms. Bishop, could you please take a look at this garment? Is this yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded slightly. "Yes, this is my dress. However, it was stolen from me a day ago. I have evidence proving that my clothing was taken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pulled up her phone, revealing footage of a woman heavily disguised, sneaking into the villa where she once lived with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman quietly took Diana's dress and then left. The dress she was holding was the same one that the police had discovered in the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer's brow furrowed as he looked at Mark with a stern gaze. "Mr. Foliot, you and your daughter reported Ms. Bishop, claiming there was new evidence. But it turns out the dress was stolen. How did it end up at the scene?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark looked at Diana in shock, unable to believe how self-assured she appeared, every word and action calculated and precise. Her clear, piercing gaze made it hard for him to even look at her directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't know," he stammered, stumbling over his own words as confusion took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that Diana would catch Amelie in the act of stealing her dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Diana had proof to back her claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Mark realized how foolish his actions today had been. But he couldn't afford to wait any longer. Lily's body was still missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer continued, "Then tell me why you're so certain the location where we found the dress is where your wife was killed. And here's an even bigger question &ndash; where is her body? You're claiming this dress is new evidence, but without a body, what kind of proof is this? Did you find her body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been searching for Lily's whereabouts as well, but up until now, it remained uncertain if Lily was dead or alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their investigation had revealed that Lily owned an apartment here. She had gone to her own apartment on the night in question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as for what happened afterward, no clues had surfaced. All the nearby surveillance cameras had been disabled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark's eyes narrowed as he glared at Diana, his expression sharp and accusing. "Where my wife's body is? Now that is something you need to answer for Diana."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="818.html">« Prev</a><a href="820.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
