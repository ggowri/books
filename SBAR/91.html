"Diana has suffered a lot in your family over the past two years, and I'm the one who threw this punch for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If she hadn't treated you all like family, do you think you would still be here safely?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale sneered, "Diana, you've gotten so awesome now that you've managed to get other men to protect you. How much effort did it take you to get these men to help you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have the blood of the Marsh family in your body, and you were born inferior, lowering our status."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned, her whole body tightening up with humiliation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were siblings, but it was incredible that Tobias could say something like that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana walked over and held Tobias' arm. "Tobias, let's go. Only a vicious person would say something so shameless."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias warned Gale indifferently, "Gale, if I see you getting in trouble with Diana next time, I will make the Marsh family disappear from </span><span>Capitole</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias left holding Diana's hand after he said it in a domineering manner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale was slightly stunned. No wonder Diana was so confident about leaving the Marsh family, since she was hooking up with a man outside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, shame on you." Gale pushed the tip of his tongue against his battered face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Diana, I won't let you go next time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had ruined the Marsh family's reputation, and he was going to tell her to go back to the country.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Diana scheming against him, Gale would never forgive Diana in his life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Steven saw the scene just now. Looking at Gale's arrogant back, he turned away with a grim face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan followed him and said, "Mr. Gellar, where are we going now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched Diana follow Tobias away. In the past few days, many men have appeared around Diana, and they were handsome.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How was Diana so good at seducing men?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was better before when Diana was a gentle housewife at home, so he didn't have to go through so much trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought it didn't matter that Diana left, that it would be better if she didn't come back, and that she didn't want to deal with the mess of the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when Diana left, her life immediately became exciting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few days, Diana impressed Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew medicine and costume design, and she knew languages from other countries as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't as much of a country tomboy as rumors had it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps there was a lot he didn't know in this.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="90.html">« Prev</a><a href="92.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
