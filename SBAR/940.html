What are you doing here?" Her voice was cold and ominous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I doing here?" Cecil sneered, "Didn't I just tell you? What's the matter? Are you so young and yet already hard of hearing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;" Queenie's voice faltered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save it, Queenie," Cecil cut her off sharply. "I won't let you wreck Uncle Wyatt's company. As long as I'm around, I'll kick Mr. Foster out of the picture. And you, Mr. Foster? You're nothing. What makes you think you can mess with the Farley family's business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's anger flared. Cecil's smug, unruly demeanor infuriated her. She snapped, "Don't forget what Wyatt did to you, Cecil! He tried to drag the Farley family down with counterfeit goods. Someone like him isn't worth helping! Or have you not suffered enough in his hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Queenie spoke, the more worked up she became. Based on what she knew about Cecil, he wouldn't usually care about something like this. After all, Wyatt and Samuel had once tried to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil glanced at Wyatt, who looked deeply ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Wyatt finally realized how much a family's unity affected its success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on his mistakes, Wyatt mused, "I've been so foolish. I thought I could handle everything alone and </span><span>make </span><span>the Farley family </span><span>better</span><span>. I believed I could surpass Ivan. But now I understand&mdash;I can't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt admitted out loud, "Cecil, help me. I was wrong. I won't oppose you or our family anymore. Now I see how important it is for a family to stick together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it now. Some people just have to hit rock bottom before they learn," he mused bitterly. "No lesson can sink in otherwise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Cecil had no desire to help Wyatt, he couldn't stand by and watch Queenie </span><span>take over the company and humiliate their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil thought grimly, "Uncle Wyatt being bullied by Queenie, losing the company, and seeing her plot against the Farley family's grandson&mdash;is she looking down on us that much? Does she think we have no one to stand up to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said firmly, "Don't worry, Uncle Wyatt. I'll handle this. I've already arranged for the company to fund the purchase of Mr. Foster's shares."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Carlo and continued, "Mr. Foster, if you don't agree to step aside, all those things you did at Silver Veil will soon reach your wife and the media. You have two choices, either walk away quietly, or I'll make sure the Foster family goes bankrupt by the end of today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every word Cecil spoke, Carlo's face grew paler. Cecil had come prepared and even knew about what Carlo had done at Silver Veil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't push it, Cecil. So what if you have money? That doesn't make you invincible," Carlo spoke through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smirked arrogantly, leisurely leaning back as he shot Carlo a sharp look. "Oh, Mr. Foster, having money makes all the difference. I can bring you to your knees and keep you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you think you can team up with Queenie to trample on the Farley family, I'll make sure the Foster family disappears from Capitole," Cecil</span><span> said coldly</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo bristled. "I'd like to see how you plan to do that. Right now, I'm the largest shareholder in the company. What are you going to fight me with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's grin widened, almost delighted. "You're the largest shareholder? Then, I'll help Uncle Wyatt split the company. No matter how big your stake is, it'll be scattered to the wind. And just think&mdash;Queenie will be right there to pick up the pieces of what's left of your company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo's eyes widened in shock, and for a moment, he was visibly shaken. "Don't go too far, Cecil," he warned coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the company was split, it would mean nothing to Carlo anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also knew that if Queenie could devour Wyatt's company, she could just as easily devour his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, Carlo's chest tightened, his heart pounding furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bring himself to meet Cecil's gaze. Cecil's timing was too perfect. If he had been just a few minutes late, they would have successfully forced Wyatt to give up the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil glanced over at Queenie and then at George before saying with a smirk. "Tsk. Mr. Gellar, you used to be such a big shot. How did you end up like this, stooping so low that you've resorted to swallowing someone else's company just to stay afloat? Steven, you're such a bastard. Honestly, you deserve this mess. Tell me, how did you manage to screw yourself over so... spectacularly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You even lost your company, didn't you? But I have to hand it to Queenie&mdash;she's something else. You gave up your company for her, and she's ready to go to war to get it back. With her thick skin, sweet words, and a heart full of knives, she's practically made for you. You two are so perfect for each other. I'll be praying for your everlasting happiness&mdash;may you both stay shackled </span><span>forever</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked at George and stayed silent. She couldn't help but notice that while George looked exactly like Steven, he didn't have Steven's overbearing presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then snapped, "Shut up, Cecil. If you think you can touch Mr. Wyatt Farley's company, you're too late. I'm a shareholder, and I don't agree with you joining the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie huffed inwardly. "That bastard. How dare Cecil try to ruin my plans? I've calculated every step&mdash;I can't let him wreck things at such a crucial moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil sneered, lounging leisurely on a nearby chair. Tilting his devilishly handsome face, he mocked Queenie, "You only hold 6% of the shares in Uncle Wyatt's company. Do you think you have any say in this? Let me tell you the truth&mdash;the largest shareholder here is me. I own 30%, even more than Uncle Wyatt. Are you going to tell me I have no say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? That's impossible!" Queenie exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carlo looked equally baffled, his mind reeling. He asked, "What are you even talking about, Cecil? I'm the largest shareholder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil glanced at him, raised his phone, and played a video. "Mr. Foster, I figured out your little scheme before I even arrived. My people tracked down your wife and your most trusted friend. I bought the shares they held. Now, I'm the biggest shareholder here. So, guess what? You guys are out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Carlo were furious, their faces flushed with rage. They hadn't seen this coming. Carlo's voice rose as he demanded, "Why the hell would my wife sell her shares to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's smile widened, his eyes sparkling mischievously like starlight. "Mr. Foster, your wife found out about the things you've been doing. With her fiery personality, did you think she'd help you? You can be cruel, but you never should have left evidence behind. Once your opponent has leverage, they'll always find a way to use it against you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Carlo stumbled back a few steps, his legs shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil arched an eyebrow at Queenie, his smirk dripping with disdain. "Queenie, you think you're untouchable, don't you? Like some rare flower blooming out of reach. But trust me, it wouldn't take much to bring you crashing down and leave you as nothing more than dirt under everyone's feet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of something dark flashed in her eyes as she fixed her gaze on the smug Cecil. She strode toward him, leaned down, and murmured</span><span> </span><span>menacingly, "Don't test me, Cecil. Cross me, and you won't like how it ends. Imagine a bitterly cold winter day, broken limbs, and no way out. Doesn't sound so nice, does it?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="939.html">« Prev</a><a href="941.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
