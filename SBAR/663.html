I've already left Steven, and this is the perfect opportunity for you. If you can't win his heart now, then everything you did to me before will have been for nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, if Queenie had just stayed in her lane, Diana leaving the Marsh family would have still left her as the most cherished princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie wasn't satisfied with that. She wanted to devour everything Paula had and live a perfect, fairy-tale life with her biological mother and their family of four.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she never anticipated that things would turn out like this. After tonight's chaos, her household would be in constant turmoil, with no peace ever again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Queenie understood this, too. But Queenie's plan had always been to drive Paula into a mental institution, just like she did with Jenny. When someone opposed her being with Steven, she got rid of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't get too smug. I won't walk into the fire, but I will make you wish you were dead," Queenie spat, seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lazily rolled around on her bed and then replied, "I've already stepped aside for you, letting you have what you wanted, and you still want to make me suffer? Queenie, do you really think I'm that easy to push around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! As long as I marry Steven, I will make sure you die," Queenie threatened viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied casually, "Alright! Then hurry up and take Steven away. I wish you both eternal happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, you seem to like taking whatever I leave behind. So if you want it all, take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze. It hit her that everything she had gained was what Diana had abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had given up the Marsh family, given up Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie felt a sudden pang of insecurity. "It's not like that, Diana. I want to see you suffer! Just you wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tut, what a pointless threat. Queenie, you can't make it in the entertainment industry anymore, so focus on winning over Steven. Lock the two of you into a perfect, lifelong bond."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said dismissively before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless woman! Do you think I can't deal with you? Now it's Steven's turn to suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, feeling delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her phone buzzed again, and this time it was Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia, are you coming back tomorrow?" Diana asked, her mood lifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia laughed. "Diana, I've just taken on another big project, so I'll be delayed for another week."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." Diana's enthusiasm waned instantly. She thought, "Why another delay? Is she short on money? "</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how her father favored his adopted daughter made her feel a deep pang of heartache. "Olivia, if you need money, just let me know."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia chuckled, "Diana, I'm not short on money, so don't worry. I'll bring you a gift when I get back. By the way, I saw the news. Queenie is Jeff's biological daughter? That's explosive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a little surprised. "So, this incident really made waves if even you heard about it overseas."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia responded, "I watch domestic news, so I still get updates. Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. Queenie called earlier and accused me of setting her up tonight. That shameless woman always claims someone is scheming against her. It's absurd. Steven and his people have coddled her so much that she's completely lost all sense of shame. Why should I be considerate of her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie's now hit a dead end, and next, it's Steven's turn to suffer for being such a fool."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia laughed, "Hasn't he always been Queenie's fool?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="662.html">« Prev</a><a href="664.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
