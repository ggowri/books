Just tie her up in the basement where it&#x27;s freezing, and let her die. No one would ever suspect a thing.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hmph! Other than her parents, who would care if she lived or died? My daughter and son are already on your side. They&#x27;ve both been won over by you. Once the divorce is final, I&#x27;ll marry you, and we can finally be together without any secrets.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, they fell back into a passionate embrace.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hold on, I still have something important to say,&quot; Amelie said, trying to catch her breath.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mark frowned, clearly annoyed. &quot;What&#x27;s the big deal now? Can&#x27;t it wait? Let&#x27;s finish this first, and then you can talk.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s crucial,&quot; she insisted. &quot;I&#x27;ve already thrown Diana&#x27;s clothes into the underground parking lot. In a couple of days, we can have Jean report it, saying the evidence proves Diana was there. That way, we can show that Cecil and that old lady are lying, and we can lock Diana up for good.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Then Queenie can marry Steven. With him, you won&#x27;t have to worry about your business at all!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Amelie, you raised a great daughter. I want my daughter to marry someone like Steven too. Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ll help you get rid of Diana so your daughter can have a smooth path to marrying him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Their conversation was soon drowned out by Amelie&#x27;s moans.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That was more than Diana could take. She quickly pushed Steven&#x27;s hand away from her eyes, saved the recording, and turned to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven sensed that she knew she couldn&#x27;t listen any longer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana ran straight to her room, slamming the door behind her, with Steven following closely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her cheeks flushed, and her heart raced as she avoided his gaze.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven wasn&#x27;t aroused by Mark and Amelie&#x27;s encounter. It was Diana&#x27;s flushed cheeks and cute expression that truly caught his attention.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sitting on the couch, Diana stared at her phone, astonished that her outing had led her to discover such incriminating evidence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A wicked smile crept across her face as she realized these two villains hadn&#x27;t given up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If they wanted a showdown, she was ready to watch the show unfold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana rummaged through her bag, pulling out another phone to send a message to Jeff.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took a deep breath, relieved that her unexpected intervention had saved Lily. Otherwise, she would be in deep trouble.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, a shadow fell beside her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Turning to see Steven, she snapped, &quot;This is all your fault! If you had just married Queenie, none of this would have happened. I&#x27;m being targeted because of you and her!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s heart ached at her frustration.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, I&#x27;ll help you sort this out. Amelie won&#x27;t get to you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He realized that Amelie had been behind all of Queenie&#x27;s schemes against Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Their plans were so seamlessly coordinated that he had begun to trust Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt completely alone. He was the only one she could rely on, yet he had let her down.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her refusal to trust him had built a wall between them, leading her to accumulate enough disappointment to finally walk away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Clenching his fists, Steven made a silent vow to uncover the truth.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Do you know where the Foliot Mansion is? I&#x27;ll send someone to search the basement.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shook her head. &quot;You won&#x27;t find it. I don&#x27;t even know where it is. I can handle this myself. I&#x27;ve never depended on anyone, unlike Queenie, who needs your help for everything.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven sighed, feeling the weight of Queenie&#x27;s presence in every issue they faced.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was clear that if he wanted a chance with Diana, he needed to deal with the Queenie problem first.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, how about we work together?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="792.html">« Prev</a><a href="794.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
