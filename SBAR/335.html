"Yes! If Steven and the others hadn't arrived in time, I would've been..." She trailed off, but everyone understood her meaning.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, that's disgusting! You'll go for anyone, young or old. I wouldn't even touch a dog, let alone you. And you were dressed like Diana, that's why I came in. I wouldn't have even looked if I'd known it was you. It's filthy."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil was furious. This woman had set him up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil's words were harsh, and Queenie felt utterly humiliated. She cried even harder. "Cecil, I'll also tell the police how you slandered me and Mr. Foliot."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil clenched his fists, a glint of rage flashing in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He recalled Diana's words. Those two scenes didn't prove anything.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace had several young people in his inner circle. After today, Cecil knew he'd find a way to expose Jace and Queenie's filthy deeds.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace could easily find an excuse to brush the matter aside.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil looked at Diana and whined, "Diana, my legs are weak. Can you help me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smelled so good, he just wanted to curl up in her arms and roll around.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood up to support him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was quick to act, grabbing Cecil by the shoulder. "I'll help you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil shot him a glare. "Do I need help from you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this wasn't the time to argue. He suddenly pointed at Queenie and said to Diana, "Diana, she tried to seduce me. I lost my innocence! I'm calling the police to make her give it back."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, you need evidence to flip this around!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was involved in this, making it even harder to resolve.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were working seamlessly together, and Jace was part of it all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana picked up her phone and really called the police, gambling that Luna could find evidence on her end.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana called the police, leaving Queenie dumbfounded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rita, seeing Diana's presence, quietly stepped out and instructed her assistant to retrieve the surveillance footage as quickly as possible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jace stepped forward, his sharp gaze fixed on Cecil's defiant face. "Cecil, you're really arrogant. You attacked Queenie and now claim she seduced you? It seems you won't learn until you see the evidence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you know there are cameras in every room here? Everything you did after entering is clearly recorded."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil frowned. He had felt unwell while going upstairs.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had seen Diana and wanted to talk to her, but everything afterward was a blur.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that point, he was already out of it. Whatever he did while unconscious wasn't intentional.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He laughed wickedly, staring at Queenie's pitiful face. With a filter on, he might've felt sorry for her, but without it, she was just repulsive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie met Cecil's gaze, a flicker of panic in her eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil spoke calmly, "Mr. Foliot, the footage will also show me losing consciousness, right? Anything done while I was drugged wasn't my own will. And the prime suspect for drugging me is Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's plotted against my grandmother before and even tried to run over her bodyguard. That's attempted murder. If you insist on calling the police, Queenie's good days are over."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace narrowed his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pondered Cecil's words, his gaze shifting to Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie cried. "Mr. Foliot, this is all a setup by him and Diana! I didn't do anything. Go ahead and call the police!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="334.html">« Prev</a><a href="336.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
