Moreover, I've decided to have our wedding next month during this visit. It took me a year to win Elsie's heart. Mom, you have to agree."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was well aware that his mother looked down upon Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula realized she couldn't sway Frank, pondering if he, too, would have to hit rock bottom like Gale before seeing the light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Throughout this ordeal, Queenie had been tirelessly encouraging her sons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, she couldn't bring herself to change her stance. She wished for her parents to pass away naturally, not driven to their graves by the family's financial ruin and her husband's infidelity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thus, she couldn't bring herself to say that. If Queenie were cornered, they would all meet a swift end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie explained with distress, "Mrs. Paula Marsh, I know you don't think much of me. My family is from the countryside, my parents aren't very capable, and we can't contribute to your family's business. But I truly love Frank. Mrs. Paula Marsh, please, don't tear us apart, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elsie, don't worry. With me here, Mom won't dare to separate us. Otherwise, I'll just run away from home again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank knew his mother's love for him remained unshaken, even after his year-long absence, during which she still supported him financially.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula looked at Frank, feeling deeply disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Indeed, it was her failure to raise her children right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's heart clenched at the sight of her disappointed gaze. Why did she look at him with such disillusionment?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula took a deep breath and declared, "I won't oppose you, but I wish you wouldn't appear before me again. Take the girl you love and live the life you desire. I will grant you your freedom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're all grown up now, and you won't heed anything I say. Since you believe love comes before career in life, then go ahead and live the life you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was taken aback. He hadn't expected Paula to consent so easily this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, thank you!" he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with excitement. He could finally be with Elsie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elsie, too, was overjoyed. She no longer had to flee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her future would be much easier with Frank's wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She harbored no desire to revisit her modest hometown. The Marsh family epitomized wealth, and from this point forward, she was set to indulge in a life of opulence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Mrs. Paula Marsh! I swear I'll take good care of Frank," Elsie exclaimed with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula turned her attention to Frank. "Frank, I had lined up a perfect match for you. Paige is an exceptional girl, but it's a shame, you just don't measure up to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He mused silently, "Why did Mom have to bring up that woman? What bad luck!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I had at last freed myself from the entanglement with Paige, and now, I stood united with Elsie, the true love of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, Mom, did you mean I'm not worthy of Paige?" Frank blurted out, the realization dawning on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A fierce glint flashed in Elsie's eyes. She thought, "That damn hag wouldn't even attend my wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How was I supposed to face people in this circle now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula ignored him, oblivious to the ferocity in Elsie's gaze. Instead, she addressed Queenie, "Queenie, your father fainted in the living room this morning. I've sent him to the hospital, and he hasn't regained consciousness yet. I've been preoccupied with company matters, so you should go to the hospital and stay with your father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was startled. "Mom, what happened to Dad? Why is it so serious?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="259.html">« Prev</a><a href="261.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
