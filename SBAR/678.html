She cried pitifully, saying, "Steven, I saved you from the fire that year. I almost died. Of course I saved you. If you don't believe me, go ask my dad. My dad knows what happened best."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stared at her and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Diana is right. I am blind. I didn't even notice Queenie's poor acting skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Queenie's cell phone rang. Queenie looked at it and was surprised that Diana had seen the photo she had just sent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately answered it in front of Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, what's wrong?" Queenie deliberately called Diana's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana cursed directly, "Can you stop showing your presence? Just let Steven take care of you. I returned him to you a long time ago. You should get him away from me quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you send me those photos and messages? If you're capable, marry him. If you're capable, carry his baby. If you're capable, get a marriage license with him and then show off in front of me. I might even think more highly of you this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop sending me this garbage. It's so disgusting that I can't eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're disgusting enough! Get lost! Don't even try to be slutty in front of me. I'm not Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, the evidence you sent me is enough. I don't need it anymore. The evidence you sent me can allow me to take half of Steven's property. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly felt a burning pain on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana finished cursing and then hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she took screenshots of the photo and dialog box and sent them directly to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Tell Queenie to stop sending me these things to disgust me. It turns out that your soul went to accompany her last night.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven received the message and realized that it had been sent before Queenie came in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie also saw it. She thought, "How could Diana do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly looked up at Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and showed his phone to Queenie. "Do you usually send these things to Diana to disgust her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Queenie blushed, wishing she could tear Diana into pieces. "Steven, I'm helping you. I want her to leave you sooner."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then?" asked Steven calmly with a meaningful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie cried so sadly, thinking, "Doesn't he know better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you promised to marry me. Why do you break your promise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven answered, "Why did you run away? If you didn't, I would marry you. You gave up, and don't regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know better than anyone why I treat you well. But you kept deliberately sabotaging my relationship with Diana. You showed me another Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Steven stood up and walked to the window. He looked at the snow outside and said in a cold voice, "Queenie, behave yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood up suddenly and, with murderous intent in her eyes, looked at his ruthless back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is Steven unwilling to help me anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew he had changed, but she still wanted to catch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really regretted what she had done before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie cried and questioned, "Steven, you said you would protect me forever. Are you just saying this?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was because of special reasons. And your mother forced me to leave. I didn't want to. Steven, I did not run away. I did not leave because you were disabled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, if you don't believe me, you can go investigate, or ask your mother."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="677.html">« Prev</a><a href="679.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
