We need to find a way to send him to the police."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie thought for a moment and said, "In three days, there will be a banquet hosted by several noble families. Jace will take me there. Cecil will also be there. We can set a trap for him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, my brother's company is moving back here. He's in the clothing business too. Find the best designer. I want to ruin Diana's career in the design world. I want to crush her."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mario said, "Yes, Miss. We're preparing everything."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled wickedly, and Mario too. He started the car to take Queenie to see Jace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Diana was still resting at home.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was tired from fishing for three days. She caught lots of seafood because the tide was low.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was so tired that she didn't go to the office for several days. On the third day, Cecil called her, and she finally got out of bed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked the maid to prepare a rose bath and a facial mask. When she was done, it was already four in the afternoon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil came to pick up Diana. She didn't hide her address from him because they were allies.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was dressed elegantly. Cecil was impressed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, has anyone ever said something to you?" Cecil asked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana got into the passenger seat and asked, "What?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil looked at her with admiration and said, "You are stunning."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and said, "Cecil, has anyone ever said something to you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil smiled playfully and asked, "What?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "You are good with words."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil touched his nose.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to hear, "You are very handsome."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't hear it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, he blushed when Diana said he was good with words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't notice Cecil's reaction. Alexander sent her a message asking if she would go to the banquet that evening.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, [Alexander, I will go. I'm on my way.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander replied, [Good. See you at the banquet.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, [Okay.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While driving, Cecil said, "Diana, Queenie will also be at the banquet tonight. As the main character of the scandal, Jace will take her there to do business and meet important people."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "It looks like Jace will support her. After all, the crying child gets the candy."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jace liked that kind of woman.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil laughed and said, "Diana, that last sentence is an insult to crying children." He wanted to say that shameless women get men, but he felt it was disrespectful to women, so he didn't say it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie made him so angry that he wanted to curse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That woman was shameless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew that Queenie had tricked Cecil before. She reminded him, "By the way, Cecil, be careful at the banquet tonight. You tricked Queenie before, and she likes to cause trouble in crowded places. You saw how she tried to trick me at Jace's banquet. Be very careful and don't eat anything given by strangers, okay?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="326.html">« Prev</a><a href="328.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
