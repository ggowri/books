If something happens to you, what will we do?" Gale put the things on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at him with tears in her eyes. "Gale, Diana framed me like that, and Steven also misunderstood me. He doesn't want me anymore. What's the point of me living?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale's expression was full of murderous intent. He thought Diana was a bad woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, don't be sad. Apart from the live broadcast, no other reports will be released. Those reporters have been arrested, and they dare not say who is behind the scenes." Gale knew that what he did was wrong, but he didn't feel guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought that Diana deserved to be treated that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie breathed a sigh of relief. With Gale's help, she was no longer afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was just sad about losing Steven's trust. After being discharged from the hospital, she would continue to make him like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie sneered and thought, "Steven, next time, I'll give you the strongest medicine and see if you can still hold it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, eat something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale lifted the small table and he put the lunch on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Queenie saw that all the dishes were her favorites, she was in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled sweetly and brightly. "Gale, you are still the one who cares for me the most. These are my favorite dishes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale handed her the fork and said, "Silly girl if I don't treat you well, who else can I treat? Eat quickly, and then we'll go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie said, "Yeah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She lowered her eyes, and a cold light flashed in her eyes. Originally, she wanted to trick Diana into coming for a blood transfusion, so that Diana would completely hate Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven would force Diana to do everything she didn't want to do for Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Queenie miscalculated, as neither Steven nor Diana took the bait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie suddenly thought of Paula, and she asked sadly, "Brother, Mom hasn't come to see me yet. Does she not love me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale looked very unhappy when he heard this. Thinking of what Paula said in the hall, he smiled and said, "I met my mother in the hall, but something happened suddenly in the company, so she left again. She told me to tell you to have a good rest and don't think too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Something happened at the company recently, and it's hard for Mom to handle the company's affairs alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie frowned and looked at Gale. She knew that Gale would not lie to her. "When I get better, I will go help Mom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since Azure Group withdrew its cooperation, the company's situation has become worse and worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I wonder who the boss of Azure Group is? When I get better, I'll go visit him or her in person. I want to know why Azure Group suddenly withdrew from the cooperation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale didn't know about this. "Queenie, you should just focus on recovering."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie smiled and said, "Okay, brother, I was wrong this time. I shouldn't have hurt myself for other people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie thought that what she did was in vain. Steven didn't care about her now because of Diana. Queenie thought, "If she wasn't there, I wouldn't have to do so many things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I can only blame my dad for not doing it thoroughly back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just kill Diana directly, and now she won't stand in my way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I can't accept such an ending."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale heard her words. He reached out and touched her head, looking at her with mixed feelings. Queenie's face was pale and looked very pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale thought, "The pain she felt when she committed suicide must be indescribable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, it's all the fault of that bastard Diana. I will find a chance to avenge her for you."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="157.html">« Prev</a><a href="159.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
