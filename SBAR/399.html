Was Steven unwilling to divorce because of that agreement?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had never heard of it before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon entering the next room, she immediately received a call from Felicity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Marsh, it is terrible. Our company has been reported for tax evasion. Last year's accounts did not tally with those on the computer. &#8203;There is a shortfall of 200 million dollars. Moreover, the investigators came in the middle of the night. Something seems amiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie flew into a rage. "How could it be? We didn't evade taxes at all, did we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew how serious the consequences of tax evasion were. If she was caught, all her previous efforts would be in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity was very anxious. "Ms. Marsh, I don't know what is going on, either. I'm still in the company. Upon receiving the call, I immediately went to the finance department. It turned out that there was 200 million dollars in tax evasion. If we can't find evidence to prove our innocence, the shortfall should be filled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was dumbfounded. Her face distorted with anger. "Felicity, we didn't evade taxes, but the manager of the finance department may cook the books. Investigate this matter right away and ask for help if necessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity replied, "Okay, Ms. Marsh."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie hung up and remembered Diana saying that she would get back at her tenfold or hundredfold. Could it be her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was impossible. How could she do it in just a few minutes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After washing her feet, Diana lay on the bed and scrolled through her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Cecil's message popped up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Diana, it worked. That's very thoughtful of you. When I looked into the manager of the finance department, something fishy was discovered. The manager has run away, and the authorities are investigating.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana grinned. She was not mistaken. In her previous life, she had seen Felicity around Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[Cecil, your men are keeping an eye on Felicity, and we will soon find out whether the company belongs to Queenie.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil replied: [Diana, got it. Have a good rest and leave it to me. I don't care whether it is Queenie's company or not. Felicity robbed me of several of my cooperation last time by unfair means. I will avenge this. Queenie quietly sent someone to my company. I can also quietly make her company disappear. She made me suffer, so I will destroy her.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. &#8203;This was the vindictive man with whom she had been familiar in her previous life.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, she spotted the message from Paige, saying that she had arrived at the hotel safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt relieved, rested for a while, and went back to her room to draw the design.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was panicky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She soon received a call from Felicity, telling her that the manager had run away and that she had to fill the gap of 200 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The authorities launched an investigation. There was no problem with the company. As long as the manager was caught, the gap could be filled. However, whether he still had the money was the key.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police caught the manager late at night. Only then did Queenie learn the truth. A few months ago, the manager became addicted to gambling and owed 80 million dollars, but the interest gradually increased, and soon it added up to more than 100 million dollars. In order to pay back the money, he used the company's tax money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her company had a total of 200 million dollars in liquid funds, part of which she had secretly transferred from Paula's company. She was so furious that she was sleepless all night because only tens of millions of dollars had been recovered. Now, she had to find a way to pay the taxes. How could she fall asleep?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="398.html">« Prev</a><a href="400.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
