She was convinced that Steven spoiled her and that she wouldn't make any missteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was furious. "You need to use her passport to create a file in the hospital. Think it through before you act. If Diana catches wind of this, you could end up in jail."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie felt drained. After years of fighting, she had achieved nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clenched her fists, feeling a wave of discomfort washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stomach even ached slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she refused to back down. She was determined to ruin Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't let all her hard work become a laughingstock, especially when everyone believed she was Steven's favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of heading back to the restaurant to find Diana, Steven went to her villa to wait for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Climbing over the wall was out of the question tonight; bodyguards were stationed everywhere. Steven's expression darkened as he realized Diana truly saw him as a thief.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed inside the car, where it was warmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned back in his seat with pressed lips, appearing cold and distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing his eyes, he felt an inexplicable irritation at the thought of Diana's indifferent demeanor, as if he meant nothing to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bored, Evan switched on his phone to listen to an audiobook.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't quite understand Steven; all he knew was that he was juggling two women.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an hour of waiting, Steven finally saw Diana stepping out of Cecil's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled as she bid farewell to Cecil. "Drive safe, Cecil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure! I'll call you when I get home," Cecil replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Diana said, watching him drive off before turning to head home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she reached the gate of the villa, someone grabbed her wrist tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, she turned around to see Steven, radiating the vibe of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, why did you come back so late?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found it amusing that he cared. "Why do you care when I come back? We have nothing to do with each other. Let go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of releasing her, Steven tightened his grip. His face looked charming in the light, yet he was cold and heartless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come with me," he insisted, pulling her along.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana resisted fiercely. "Steven, let me go. Have a little self-respect! I've told you clearly that I don't want to see you. Why do you keep showing up? Let go! I want nothing to do with you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Steven dragged her into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fastened her seatbelt before asking Evan to drive them to the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's anxiety bubbled over. "Where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven shot her an arrogant look. "We're going home."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana retorted, "My home is in the back. Where do you expect me to go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it hit her; he had given her the key earlier that morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling sick at the realization that Steven was still holding her hand, she snapped, "Let go of me. Don't touch me. It's disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes flared with anger. "Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? If you were willing to divorce me, I wouldn't feel this way. You already have Queenie, so stay away from me. It's gross."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan couldn't help but admire Diana's courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven clenched his hands, thinking, "Does she really hate me this much?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="629.html">« Prev</a><a href="631.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
