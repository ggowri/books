He pressed his lips and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I will make up for what I owe Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to take her to buy a ring yesterday. But her eyes were clear, and there was no trace of love in them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't love him anymore, and he panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven ignored Eric and, turning to get into the car, left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan drove away quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric didn't understand, thinking, "If Steven doesn't love Diana, why does he keep tangling her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm now Queenie's driver. I have to endure it even if she deliberately humiliates me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I want to help my mother get the 200 million dollars back. I also want to know Queenie's plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric leaned against the car, waiting for Queenie to finish the formalities and come down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Cecil's voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, have you finished the infusion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I'll come to see you now and bring you some good news. What do you want for lunch? I'll bring it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Spicy grilled steak, spaghetti with meat sauce, beef curry soup... Why are they all heavy flavors? You're injured now. You should eat something light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it. I'll go to Favour Restaurant. These dishes are made the best at Favour Restaurant. I'll be at your house in about 40 minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bottle of Coke? How can an injured person drink Coke?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, you have so many excuses. See you in 40 minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric knew that Diana was injured. But he couldn't see Diana. He didn't even know where she lived. So, even if he wanted to see her, he couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "She received an infusion today. It seems she was seriously injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric watched Cecil's car leave and wanted to follow it. But the moment he opened the car door, he held back. He thought, "I'm Queenie's driver now. I might as well be her driver willingly and get the useful information first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for 20 minutes, Queenie and Mario entered the parking lot. Eric thought about it and squatted next to another car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was furious. "Ms. Marsh, I feel Mr. Gellar did it on purpose. If it weren't for his bid, we could have saved at least 100 million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie also found it strange. Steven had promised her, but he suddenly bid higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and suppressed the doubts in her heart. "It doesn't matter. We are lucky to have 50 million dollars less than the budget. Many people are pestering us to cooperate. We don't have to worry about attracting investment in the early stage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario felt much better because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, Eric suddenly offered to be your driver. There are many things we cannot say in front of him. We must be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Queenie snorted, her pretty face full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is just an idiot. What are you afraid of? He has always doted on me. Even if I asked him to kill Diana, he would not hesitate. As long as he always stands on our side, we can temporarily not kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, he will block our plan. Our acquisition plan in Paula's side is in progress. But her attitude is still strong. She has been holding on to not allow the acquisition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario wondered whether they should drop some explosive information so that Paula would sell the company to them as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's eyes were full of sarcasm. She smiled coldly, "Don't worry. Wait a few more days. I will make up the 200 million dollars first to make her feel at ease. Then, you can put pressure on her in the name of our company. Within 500 million dollars, we can acquire her company and ask her to transfer the technology to us. The technology she holds is worth more than 1 billion dollars."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="515.html">« Prev</a><a href="517.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
