Diana is scheming. She plotted against me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale said, "I had long told you not to be so cruel to Diana. She didn't do anything wrong, but you were the one who provoked her first." Gale's tone was calm. Frank was even more stubborn than him, and he knew that Frank wouldn't listen to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was determined to help Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale continued, "Frank, Diana is our biological sister. She was a baby when she was taken away, and she had no choice. Why did you hurt Diana for Queenie? Solve this trouble yourself this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale hung up the phone after he finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, Gale!" Frank was in a rage, and he didn't think carefully about what Gale said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank got out of the car and went straight to Steven's company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he entered the company entrance, the security guard stopped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank frowned and said, "Don't you know me? I'm here to see the president. Hurry and let him down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guard said with disdain, "I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Gellar said he doesn't want to see you. Please leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned, thinking, "Did Steven know that I came to him? Why didn't he let me in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He got angry, took out his mobile phone, and called Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The call was connected, and Frank was very happy. "Steven, you watched the livestream, right? Diana plotted against me. Please help me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said indifferently, "Frank, before you say this, you should understand that you are plotting against my wife. I have heard everything you said. Isn't it enough that I have helped your family in these years? Diana is still my wife. Do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Steven hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was stunned, looking at the phone screen and thinking, "What's going on with Steven? He has handled my family and Queenie's affairs before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people are scolding Queenie. Why is Steven so indifferent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank thought many things had changed in an instant. He couldn't help but think, "What happened during the year of my absence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He called Steven again, but Steven didn't answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was furious. Suddenly, he saw many reporters coming towards him. He immediately got into the car and drove away in fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he passed by Diana's company, he saw Alexander and Diana standing at the entrance of the company and talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander bought coffee for Diana. The autumn breeze blew Diana's hair, and her smile was gentle, making her look charming and cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Frank was looking at Diana, he almost hit a passerby on the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hurriedly braked. The passerby cursed Frank and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Alexander entered the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank's eyes turned bloodshot with anger. "Diana, I won't let you go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Frank was driving, he received a call from his assistant. "Mr. Marsh, the news popularity can't be suppressed at all. Netizens are scolding you for being heartless and vicious. Several partners canceled the cooperation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank finally knew the price he had to pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's action destroyed Frank's company and Queenie's reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To save her reputation, Queenie hurriedly went to see Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her tearful look, Jace felt very distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie said with sobs, "Mr. Foliot, I really didn't know things would turn out like this. Frank is so stupid. He just dotes on me so much. What should I do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shed tears and deliberately fell into Jace's arms, "Mr. Foliot, please help me. I really don't want to lose this opportunity."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="296.html">« Prev</a><a href="298.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
