She decided to take her time remembering. Maybe something would suddenly trigger her memory, and it would all come back to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stood up wearily and headed upstairs. She was so tired, all she wanted was to lie down and sleep right away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her exhausted frame and followed closely behind, keeping an eye on her every move. He was ready to catch her at any moment, afraid she might stumble down the stairs. His hand hovered, prepared to steady Diana if needed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Diana let out a startled cry as she pitched forward. Steven quickly caught her in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling his breath, Diana only felt sleepier. Leaning into the familiar embrace, she closed her eyes comfortably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned closer into Steven's arms, her voice drowsy as she asked, "Steven, do you know why I'm so good at medicine but refuse to work in a hospital?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven scooped her up in his arms without a word. He knew&mdash;it was because hospital work was too exhausting. She loved a carefree life. All these years, she had stayed by his side willingly, yet he had failed to cherish her goodness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carried her upstairs slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t hear his response and said, "Because working in a hospital is exhausting. I get tired so easily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she completely drifted off to sleep in Steven's warm embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled softly, lowering his gaze to her peaceful sleeping face. Her long, curled lashes, rosy cheeks, and steady breathing&mdash;she was breathtaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had always known she was beautiful. He never dared to get this close to her, afraid he</span><span>'</span><span>d be completely captivated, afraid he</span><span>'</span><span>d bring her harm. That overwhelming urge to push her away, yet desperately wanting her to stay, was tearing him apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once they reached the room, Steven carefully laid Diana on the bed and gently changed her into soft pajamas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gazed at her alluring figure, his eyes filled with desire. This time, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t look away. She was his wife&mdash;he had every right to look at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After helping her change, he went to the bathroom and brought out a bowl of water to gently wipe her body. He was meticulous, but when he saw the burn scars on her back, his heart ached deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was right to curse him. He was a fool, too blind to even recognize who had saved him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently traced her alluring lips with his fingers, then leaned in for a kiss, filled with possessiveness. It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t until Diana began to struggle slightly, her breath hitching, that he reluctantly let her go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a faint smile and went to the bathroom to freshen up. Half an hour later, he returned to Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s side, holding her close as they drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back home, Queenie was furious. She swept everything off the table in a fit of rage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario stared at her coldly. "Queenie, have you fallen for him?" His voice was icy as he gripped her frantic hands tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let go!" Queenie shouted at him angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meeting his gaze, Queenie couldn't help but shiver. Mario's eyes were terrifying. Her fiery temper faltered for a moment under the sharpness of his stare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario saw her finally stop, fear flickering across her face. He smirked. "Queenie, you're my woman now. Get it together. Steven never cared about you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop wasting your time on him. Move forward, that's what you need to do. I've found a great partner&mdash;Tanner Morrison, Elroy's older brother. You know their family has quite the reputation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've got my eye on the land Elroy casually sold off. It's going to be worth billions in the future. Tanner wants to team up with us to take it back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie bit down hard on her lower lip, her fists clenched tightly. She stopped smashing things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was startled by the cruelty in Mario's eyes&mdash;far harsher than Steven's. Queenie felt like a prey being watched by a starving wolf.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She yanked her hand away. "Are you crazy, or is he? The paperwork's all in order. How exactly are you planning to take it back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario let out a cold laugh. "Queenie, you</span><span>'</span><span>ve never been one for principles. Even with legal paperwork, you can twist it into something illegal. They</span><span>'</span><span>re about to start construction&mdash;you</span><span>'</span><span>ll figure something out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at the sly grin on Mario's face and smirked. "Mario, you</span><span>'</span><span>re not like a blind man who, the moment he regains his sight, throws away his cane, are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario frowned slightly, staring at her. "What are you talking about? You think I</span><span>'</span><span>m using you? I stayed by your side because I truly love you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You funded my college education, sent me abroad to study, and gave me a life I could never have dreamed of."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, stop overthinking all that nonsense. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll give you a beautiful future. I don</span><span>'</span><span>t care about your past&mdash;I only care about the kindness you</span><span>'</span><span>ve shown me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop overthinking." Mario leaned down and pressed a firm kiss on her lips, his dominance unmistakable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie shuddered, snapping back to reality. Mario's domineering affection had a way of getting to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wrapped her arms around his neck and warned him, "Mario, if you ever betray me, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll kill you on the spot."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie meant it. She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t handle another betrayal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario was handsome, but he wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario's scent lingered around her. It was clean, something she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario placed her hand on his chest, his eyes filled with desire. "Queenie, want me to rip my heart out and show it to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie shot him a reproachful look. "You</span><span>'</span><span>re so bad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario captured her lips in a kiss. Queenie quickly kissed him back. Only by giving in completely could she erase the anger and sadness buried deep inside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been a while for Mario, and now he was like a wild beast, fiercely claiming what was his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After two climaxes, Queenie finally drifted into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario watched her sleep, then picked up his phone to call his assistant. "Where</span><span>'</span><span>s Yvette?" His voice was laced with irritation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gillespie, she</span><span>'</span><span>s at Frothy Bar."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario let out a cold laugh. "She was supposed to finalize Mr. Rangel's contract tonight, wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t she? Stop the signing. Drag her to the underground parking lot. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll deal with her personally."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The assistant replied, "Understood, Mr. Gillespie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario hung up the phone, pressed a kiss to Queenie</span><span>'</span><span>s forehead, then got dressed and left the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, in a dimly lit room tucked in the corner of the underground parking lot, Yvette's hands and feet were tied up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room was spacious, with dim lighting. Against the wall stood a large, soft bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvette looked around in terror. Her mouth was sealed with black tape, and all she could manage were muffled whimpers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the door swung open, and she stared at the entrance in fear.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1112.html">« Prev</a><a href="1114.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
