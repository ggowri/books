"Jeff, you bastard."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's resentful gaze made Jeff pause. "No... Paula, she called the police on me..." he said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You insulted her right from the start. Shouldn't she call the police on you?" Paula sneered. "If you're so afraid, why were you so bold with your words earlier?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was stunned. He suddenly sensed that Paula had changed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since when had this change begun?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff's gaze turned dark as he looked at Paula. Had she really found out that everything he did recently was just an act for her?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula flashed him a mocking smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff's heart pounded. If he were taken by the police tonight, his company would be ruined by tomorrow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff turned to Diana. "Diana, I was just joking. Drop the charges quickly, and I promise I'll never say anything like that again."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was despicable, cunning, and sly. He was always adaptable, with no sense of shame.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, but I took your 'joke' seriously. If you never learned the law, let the police educate you on how to be a decent person," Diana said bluntly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana showed no mercy. She would no longer be lenient with the Marsh family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police arrived soon, and Jeff was taken away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula walked toward Amelie, who stepped back in fear. "What do you want?" she asked nervously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula felt sick at the sight of her. This woman had turned her two-decade-long marriage into a joke.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula smiled sweetly at her. "Amelie, don't be afraid. I had no choice just now. My husband's been mentally unstable lately. The doctor said he might have dementia, and he mistook you for me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was my fault earlier for hitting you. Don't take it to heart. My husband and I have been together for many years, and our love is real. I just couldn't stand seeing him with another woman. I acted impulsively. You saw how incoherent he was tonight. He might be having an episode.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I had his health report before, but I couldn't bear to tell him he's sick. Tonight, he had a sudden outburst."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff had dementia?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could that be? If anyone should have dementia, it should be Paula. How did it turn out to be Jeff?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was also surprised. What was Paula trying to do?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana quickly understood. Paula was planning to send Jeff to a mental hospital.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that Paula was spreading the news that Jeff had dementia, it wouldn't be long before he'd start acting violently, making it easy to have him committed as a mental patient.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie couldn't help but ask, "He... really has dementia?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula lowered her gaze and sighed. "Yes. He's already started forgetting things and talking nonsense."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula pulled out a medical report. "Look, I couldn't bear to show him the results. I love him very much, and I'll always put him first. That's why I got so upset earlier."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In truth, Jeff only ever loved himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was momentarily confused by Paula's scheme. What was she planning?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a scream of terror came from upstairs.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="330.html">« Prev</a><a href="332.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
