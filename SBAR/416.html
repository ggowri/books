Can't I have other men? You can create beautiful memories in your prime, and so can I. There are plenty of handsome men in the world&mdash;mature, charming, young, and innocent. Good men are everywhere. After leaving you, I can find any type I want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's mind conjured the image of her standing beside Joseph and smiling brightly. His anger flared. He abruptly grabbed Diana's neck and said coldly, "Diana, we are still not divorced. Keep your affairs in check."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By what right do you ask me to behave? We have long lost any affection between us. Since you are unwilling to divorce, then we should live our separate lives. Stay out of my business. You are now an insignificant person to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's throat ached from his grip. Tears welled up in her eyes as she coldly glared at Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven noticed her pained expression and immediately released her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana coughed painfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned. Why did she always provoke his anger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly realized that Diana's every move was affecting his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could ignite his rage effortlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a deep breath, tears streaming down her face as she looked at Steven. "Steven, you bastard. You are an extremely narcissistic and extremely insecure bastard. You never want to admit your weaknesses and never admit your mistakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You always use such methods to prove your strength, gaining validation of your power by hurting me. You are despicable and shameless. You are a man without moral boundaries, extremely selfish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana touched her neck, feeling the pain and swelling. She shed tears of grievance but insisted on speaking her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was strong, and she was no match for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, contemplating every word she had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gazed at her, feeling she seemed right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took advantage of Diana and hurt her. He protected Queenie and was involved with her. These seemed to be the traits of a selfish and morally bankrupt person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I apologize. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just wanted to tell you that during our marriage, you should behave properly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What does behaving properly mean? You can't even do it yourself. Why do you have the right to demand this from me?" Diana looked at him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Steven's icy gaze, she quickly averted her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, if you dare touch me again, I will poison you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's voice was hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing the bruising on her neck and her hoarse voice, Steven frowned, his hands clenched. He hadn't exerted much force, yet he had hurt her. She was too delicate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan, who was driving, complained inwardly, "So temperamental. You deserve your wife's hatred!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car fell silent, with only the sound of the traffic outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's breathing was heavy. The throat was inherently fragile, and Steven's firm grip had indeed caused her a lot of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It would take at least forty minutes to get back to the Gellar Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana leaned against the car door, resting her eyes, maintaining a distance from Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was even angrier at her indifference. She didn't even want to ride in the same car with him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the car stopped at a red light. Diana opened her eyes slowly. In the distance, the vast electronic screen on the building was broadcasting financial news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't hear what the host was saying, but she could see it was the latest financial news report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was the wealthiest person in Capitole, the Powell family the second, and the Farley family the third.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The following were all the established families in Capitole.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought, "It's great. The achievements of Steven and Queenie are truly enviable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in this life, everything had changed. The news of Steven becoming the first richest person was announced prematurely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered that in her previous life, the news was announced two years later&mdash;after Steven and Queenie got married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She frowned slightly, thinking, "Why did this happen so early in this life? What went wrong?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="415.html">« Prev</a><a href="417.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
