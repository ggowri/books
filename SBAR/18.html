Sure enough, something happened to you.&quot;</p><p>Diana was very grateful to Olivia. Olivia rarely came out. Now, Olivia came out for her. How could she not be thankful? &quot;Thank you so much, Olivia. I&#x27;m fine. I&#x27;ve encountered some troubles recently, but I can handle it.&quot;</p><p>Olivia said, &quot;I know you can handle it. Don&#x27;t I know your ability? As long as you don&#x27;t love Steven blindly, you can handle anything.&quot;</p><p>Diana smiled, &quot;By the way, his lover is back. We got divorced three months ago, and I am single now.&quot;</p><p>Olivia was very excited. &quot;Diana, did you really get divorced?&quot;</p><p>Diana looked at Olivia with amusement. In her previous life, Olivia had said that Steven would kill her, but Diana didn&#x27;t take it seriously.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia was a disciple of Elijah Evert. She was proficient in metaphysics and was very accurate in her calculations.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana thought, &quot;In my previous life, I didn&#x27;t believe it because I loved Steven&#x27;s face too much.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, I believe it. Even if Queenie farts, Steven thinks it smells good.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No matter how Queenie frames me, he doesn&#x27;t believe me and only believes Queenie, who grew up with him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, I feel sick when I see them. Only those who have experienced it can understand that feeling.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia hugged Diana tightly again and patted her back gently.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;That&#x27;s great, Diana. You finally came to your senses and stopped loving that scumbag. Steven&#x27;s enjoying your kindness while bullying you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;This kind of man should be sent to the recycling station.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Let me take you to get your face treated. The person who hit you won&#x27;t have a good ending.&quot; Olivia pulled Diana away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana sneered, thinking, &quot;Anyone who hit me would naturally not have a good ending because I would pay it back tenfold.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She sent a message to Luna, asking Luna to wake up Rita secretly. Rita had a scratch on the sole of her foot, which was poisonous and difficult to cure. Ordinary doctors could not diagnose it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven looked at the backs of the two and clenched his fists. He thought, &quot;Diana is serious this time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I just feel sorry for Queenie. She grew up with me and is sensitive.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The last time I beat Diana was because I was too angry. She even dared to kidnap Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But later, it turned out to be a misunderstanding. I suddenly didn&#x27;t want to get divorced anymore.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I feel empty inside and can&#x27;t bear the thought of Diana leaving.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I know how good Diana is.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She prepares a nutritious breakfast every morning and waits for me to come home every night.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thinking about the empty villa during the months she was away, Steven suddenly looked gloomy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But when he thought about Queenie, who had grown up with him and was often bullied by Diana, the good things about Diana in his heart were instantly replaced by Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, let&#x27;s go.&quot; Queenie came out of the ward and felt comfortable when she saw that Steven was the only one outside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven heard her voice and softened his expression, looking gentle.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Okay! Let&#x27;s go.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie took his arm and saw that he was in a good mood. She smiled, &quot;Steven, Diana is too rampant. She will bring danger to our family. Besides, the person you want to marry has always been me. Diana has signed. When will you go to complete the final procedures?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought, &quot;I have to marry Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven only cares about me, and I will live a happy life in the future.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was this topic again. Steven&#x27;s calm heart became restless again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He lowered his eyes and looked at the woman beside him. Queenie&#x27;s eyes were full of affection, like an ocean filled with love.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They had grown up together, and her loving eyes made him irresistible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But remembering Diana&#x27;s mocking face, he said, &quot;Let&#x27;s talk about it later. I will do what I promised you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven finished speaking and felt depressed and uncomfortable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Moreover, his cooperation with Azure Group was suddenly terminated.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Queenie heard his promise, she couldn&#x27;t hide her joy. She leaned on Steven&#x27;s arm and smiled gently. If Steven refused to divorce, she had plenty of ways to force Steven and Diana to divorce.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She would not let Diana snatch anything that belonged to her, even a grain of rice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had known about Diana for a long time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Diana came back, Queenie&#x27;s first step was to use her superb acting skills to make everyone hate Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her eyes were filled with malicious intentions. She was looking forward to the scene of Diana apologizing in front of everyone tomorrow night.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="17.html">« Prev</a><a href="19.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
