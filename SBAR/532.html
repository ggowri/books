Then, he narrowed his eyes and asked, "Ms. Bishop, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She showed an indifferent attitude, saying, "Mr. Wyatt Farley, if you don't want others to know, then don't do it yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave him a meaningful and cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Samuel Farley, I'm waiting for you to kill me next time. Next time, it won't be so easy for you to get out. I always welcome you to come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, she left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you bitch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt slapped Samuel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel had never been hit by Wyatt before. This slap stunned him, and then he looked at Wyatt in shock. "Dad...why...why do you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hit you, you idiot. You still don't understand what Diana meant just now. She can let you go this time, but she's waiting for you to make a bigger mistake, the kind that you'll never be able to get out of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was vicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, she has a vicious mind, and I will definitely find a way to kill her." His eyes were full of murderous intent. However, it disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt always felt that something was wrong. How could Cecil know about Henson Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he took advantage of this matter to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil never went to the construction site. Wyatt secretly cooperated with Amy. The materials they use do not comply with national regulations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bought all of them at low prices, made some money from it, and was also able to bring down Ivan. This was a win-win situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, what went wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strange gaze was cold and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel looked at Wyatt's worried expression and asked, "Dad, what should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unrealistic to kill Diana now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to find another opportunity and would not do it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt frowned, his eyes full of sharpness. "You should be more obedient during this period. Something happened to the property. I have to go and deal with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can't deliver the building, all our money will be invested in this project."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he left quickly with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was left directly at the door of the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Dad, I'm not in the car yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was so angry that Wyatt didn't want him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana drove the car over and stopped in front of him. She rolled down the window and said with a smile, "Mr. Samuel Farley, don't forget to tell the person behind you to ask her to come up with a better idea for you next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was shocked and looked at Diana with his bloodshot eyes as if he had seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her car had already left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at the reporters who were waiting not far away through the rearview mirror and smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Samuel, next was hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked a tree on the roadside angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, Diana, I want you to die! If I can't kill you, I won't be called Samuel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted this out loud, and there happened to be reporters broadcasting live in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reporters were shocked by his words.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="531.html">« Prev</a><a href="533.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
