The woman in front of her was undeniably beautiful, but every single word out of her mouth made Lillian's blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each sentence hit like a slap, making it harder and harder to keep her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had encountered all kinds of people before, but never anyone as aggravating as Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, I have no idea what you're talking about! Who's supposedly making me do this? No one! I'm the victim here. It was Cecil who tried to force himself on me! I barely escaped&mdash;do I really have to be accused on top of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice cracked as she shouted, frustration spilling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana considered herself sharp-tongued, but this woman? She gave her a run for her money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana could speak, another woman stepped in, her arms crossed, face twisted in scorn. She just hated that Diana was prettier than her and saw an opportunity to drag her down. "You're already stuck in a wheelchair, and your heart is still this wicked? Everyone saw what happened&mdash;it was Cecil who tried to take advantage of this poor girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now you want to twist the truth? Frame her? She's the real victim. Do you think we're all blind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a soft chuckle, putting on her face something that wasn't quite a smile. "Oh, so because she's the one screaming her lungs out, that automatically makes her the victim? Meanwhile, the 'culprit'&mdash;who, by the way, wasn't even lucid&mdash;somehow doesn't count?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, is that the rule now? The louder you cry, the more innocent you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was smiling, but it wasn't comforting. It was the kind of smile that sent a prickle down your spine&mdash;sweet on the surface, but laced with something venomous underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian shivered. There was something eerie about Diana's calmness, something that set her teeth on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the victim! My clothes were ripped&mdash;I barely got away! If I hadn't, I&mdash;" She cut herself off, shaking her head as if reliving the horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze sharpened, the flicker of something dangerous in her eyes. "So just because you ran downstairs and Cecil chased after you, that makes him guilty? Where's your proof? Where's the torn clothing? Got any evidence? Go ahead&mdash;show me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was picking apart every word, every inconsistency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where the hell was Luna? Why wasn't she here yet? Something didn't sit right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, Luna had tailed Queenie's people and ended up kidnapped&mdash;dumped in an abandoned building, left for dead. If Diana hadn't gotten there in time, she wouldn't have made it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes, shifting her gaze to Queenie, who stood stiffly nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thin sheen of sweat glistened on Queenie's forehead. Keeping up that elegant persona was no easy task, especially when your legs were screaming in pain&mdash;or when you were about to be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned back to Lillian. "Miss, if you're so convinced you've been wronged, why don't we let the police handle it? They can dig into who started this, who did what, and who's lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and just so you know, this estate belongs to the Farley family. Even if someone tried to wipe the security footage, it can be recovered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word landed with a heavy thud, like a hammer slamming against Lillian's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana might have been in a wheelchair, but the cold authority in her presence made it clear&mdash;cross her at your own risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was smiling, sure, but that icy stare of hers? That was what sent chills down people's spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Call the cops? And risk actual evidence surfacing? That wasn't an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's face appeared a stiff smirk. No. It wouldn't come to that. She still had a trump card to play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been so rattled by Diana that she completely forgot the skills she prided herself on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana arched a brow. "If you've got no objections, I'll go ahead and call them now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian pressed her lips together, making a split-second gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't even gotten paid yet. She'd been stuck here for ages, and this was the first time Queenie had finally brought her out to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian hesitated for half a beat&mdash;then, she nodded, feigning defiance. "Fine! Call them. Let them investigate. I've got nothing to hide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footage was gone for good. She knew that for a fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pulled out her phone and dialed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making the call, she turned to address the crowd. "Ladies and gentlemen, we all know Cecil&mdash;he's wealthy, he's good-looking, and let's be real, plenty of women would jump at the chance to get in his bed. So, to set things straight and clear both his name and this young lady's, let's all stick around. Before the cops arrive, the screen up front will be showing some evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the onlookers had already put the pieces together. But an opportunity to see Cecil taken down a notch? That was something no one wanted to miss. In this kind of crowd, everyone was just waiting for someone to fall so they could take their place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew exactly what she was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian clenched her fists, willing herself to stay composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same woman from earlier called out, "Good! We're all here&mdash;we might as well see the truth for ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes narrowed as she studied Diana. How was she always this confident?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at the bodyguards. "Bring that antidote over to Cecil. And this time, watch it closely. Don't let it get swiped again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard, still guilt-ridden from before, took the pill from Diana and shot a warning glare at Lillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, if you've got nothing to hide, let Mr. Farley take the medicine. Then we'll see who's telling the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was ice-cold, and the words made Lillian's stomach twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Diana, who still sat there, completely at ease&mdash;like none of this was the least bit unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's unwavering calm set her nerves on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the bodyguard successfully got Cecil to take the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned to Diana, raising her voice. "Diana, do you just carry antidotes around with you? And what makes you so sure that pill will even work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tilted her head, looking up at her. The angle made Queenie feel uncomfortably like she was being scrutinized from below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My medicine neutralizes just about anything. That's why it costs 200 thousand dollars per dose. Someone drinks poison? If they take this in time, they'll live. Two hundred thousand dollars for a life? Sounds like a fair deal to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Miss&mdash;you owe me 200 thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought about it for a second. Yeah, she wasn't letting that slide. Not a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian froze. A creeping sense of regret sank in. She had only wanted to keep Cecil Farley from waking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell was she supposed to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way she could cough up that kind of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured amongst themselves, eyes darting between Lillian and Cecil, waiting for him to regain his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian watched Cecil closely. Even after taking the antidote, his eyes were still glazed over. It would take time for him to snap out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to act before that happened&mdash;before he could defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving quickly, she stepped closer to him. His vacant gaze met hers, his mind still clouded. She lifted her wrist, a delicate bell jingling softly from a thin bracelet. Her voice dropped low, smooth and hypnotic. "Mr. Farley, do you remember me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1021.html">« Prev</a><a href="1023.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
