She was done with letting him waste his life away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sending Gale away had been her attempt to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank was a true fool, and Eric, even worse, a dangerous fool with a sharp tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother adored that Eric for his smooth talk, so Paula still wanted to give him one last chance, just this once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you're joking, right? Who's he even seeing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Paula like she was the crazy one, shifting the blame onto Diana yet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula froze, then let out a cold laugh. "I was foolish to think you could actually understand anything, Eric. You're right. It's a joke. Only now I see that rotten is just in Jeff's genes. Now get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more she realized there was no saving those who didn't think they needed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, she grabbed her phone and dialed her assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Linda, post that statement. From this day on, I sever all ties with my four sons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff made her sick, and she was through with his sons too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's face went pale, and he yelled in frustration, "Mom, do you really have to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula didn't hesitate. "Yes, I do. Every last one of you in the Marsh family are leeches. I thought I could save you, but clearly, I was wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was of the essence now, and she had to make her move against Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic set in for Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had everything. Without her, he'd be left with nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stammered, desperate, "Is this because of Diana? Are you letting her take my grandparents' inheritance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit Paula hard, and she took a shaky step back, her heart clenched with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had her life turned into this nightmare?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric," she snarled, "other than picking on Diana, what else can you do? You're so full of yourself. Why don't you go after someone like Steven or Cecil? But no, you go for the easiest target, thinking you're a big man for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, get out. And remember, if you so much as whisper a word about this to Queenie or your father, you'll just be speeding up your own end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula knew he wouldn't do it as he didn't want to upset Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All four brothers treated Queenie like a princess, bending to her every word as if it held their lives in balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people were simply rotten to the core, finding any excuse to justify their actions, pretending they weren't at fault. They'd convince themselves of anything to dodge the blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's heart was heavy. She needed someone to lean on, but she had no one except her two loyal assistants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned and walked away, leaving Eric stunned and speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she was gone, Eric raced to Linda, determined to stop her from posting the statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at the slightly stout secretary, spitting his threat. "Linda, if you dare to post it, I'll go jump off a building."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="458.html">« Prev</a><a href="460.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
