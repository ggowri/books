"Let's follow her and see. We might get to witness an unexpected drama."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Jeff should have already received the sample from his supposed son abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that brat was back in the country, and Paula had already tracked his whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric looked at his mother's pale face, visibly worried. "Mom, you're still running a fever. How about seeing a doctor first? Taking care of your health should come first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula shook her head. "No, let's go check it out first. Queenie has an older brother abroad. I've heard some news&mdash;he's back, but he might not be Jeff's son. Queenie rushing to the hospital like this probably means Jeff already got the sample. This hospital is reputable and certified to perform paternity tests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's face fell in shock as he yelled angrily, "Mom, why do we have to deal with such awful people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula gave him a bitter smile, patting his hand. "It's my blindness that caused you all to suffer with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric felt deeply guilty. It was really their fault as brothers for being blind to Jeff and Queenie's deceit&mdash;and to their own hypocrisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's not your fault. It's us being useless that caused..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric couldn't continue. He deeply regretted how he had treated Diana in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Diana wouldn't forgive them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still hoped Diana would find happiness and joy in the days ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, let's go. I'll go with you to check things out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula nodded. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The paternity test center was in a building behind the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Queenie arrived, Jeff had already submitted the sample.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie grabbed Jeff by the collar, hitting him as she shouted, "Jeff! I've suffered with you for so many years, and now you doubt me because of someone else? Do you even have a heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sneered coldly, his eyes filled with disgust. "Amelie, you're saying I don't trust you? If the boy is mine, then what are you so afraid of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Getting a paternity test is perfectly normal. Calm yourself down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was agitated, almost wanting to strangle her. How dare she lie to him? He had poured so much effort into raising Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had staked the rest of his life on that boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie trembled with anger, letting out a cold laugh. "Jeff, if that's the case, then between us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie quickly interrupted her mother. Divorce was out of the question now; it would ruin her career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you're here! Talk some sense into your father. He doesn't believe your brother is his son. Your older brother is back, and this is clearly breaking his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before your brother finds out your father is doing a paternity test, try to convince him. Don't let him lose his last son's love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff looked at Queenie, his voice suddenly calm. "Queenie, this is between your mother and me. Stay out of it. I submitted the sample nearly two hours ago. The results will be out any moment now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie trembled when she heard his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Jeff, how could you be so shameless?" Amelie snapped in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing nearby, Paula sneered and turned to Eric. "Eric, call your Grandma and Grandpa. Let them see what kind of person their 'precious grandson' turned out to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's gaze was icy as he smiled and nodded. "Mom, this is exactly the kind of moment they should witness firsthand. They've called us useless for years, and now their eldest grandson is gone, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric stepped aside to make the call to Tracey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply informed them, leaving it up to them whether or not they wanted to show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the testing room, Queenie and her parents waited in tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie already had a feeling about the results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie looked ashen, her head lowered as she sent a message on her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sat in regretful silence, closing his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour passed before the testing room door finally opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor addressed Jeff. "Mr. Marsh, the test results are ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor handed the paternity test to Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie lunged forward to snatch it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jeff grabbed it before she could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the test high, Jeff glared at her. "Amelie, what are you afraid of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie froze. "I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Noah really isn't my son, is he?" Jeff asked. Deep down, her reaction had already confirmed it for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, clinging to a sliver of hope, he wanted to see the result for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie kept her face blank and didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stayed silent, her expression equally emotionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff quickly opened the paternity test, flipping to the last page.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he saw that the paternity test proved no biological relationship, he laughed&mdash;a bitter laugh that soon turned into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was filled with anguish. "Amelie, I'm such a fool. You've been lying to me all these years. Noah really isn't my son. I raised him abroad, giving him millions of dollars every year. How much have I spent on him over these twenty-plus years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You calculate it for me. Since he's not my son, I want all that money back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was utterly devastated. He had never felt this hopeless in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, I divorced Paula to give you a happy home. All these years, I've wronged Paula for your sake. And what did you do? The son isn't even mine! How could you do this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelie could respond, Jeff erupted in rage, shouting, "Amelie! How could you? How dare you use someone else's son to deceive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing there was no point in hiding the truth, Amelie let out a bitter laugh. Glaring at Jeff in anger, she snapped, "Jeff, do you remember how you chased after Paula for her money? You promised me a happy home, but you were too busy playing lover-boy to care whether I lived or died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I wait for you forever? If I hadn't gotten pregnant with Queenie, I would have married someone else a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only reason I stayed as your mistress all these years was because of the money you gave me. But you want my son? No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wouldn't even marry me, so why would I have your child? My son is brilliant, while your four useless sons were discarded by you without a second thought. You abandoned your own biological sons and even your daughter. I never expected you to treat my son with any sincerity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned. He had genuinely cared for his "son," yet she saw him this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelie, I've never done anything to hurt you. Why would you do this to me?" Jeff was overwhelmed with emotion, consumed by a desire to strangle her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie shoved him angrily, her face twisted with rage. "Jeff, you want to know why? Do you even remember how you treated me back then?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="890.html">« Prev</a><a href="892.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
