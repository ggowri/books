I just didn't expect the person who adopted Diana would be so rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie growled, "Did she deliberately pretend to be from the countryside to deceive us then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff had no idea. Anyway, he never regarded Diana as his own daughter. He got her back for his own benefit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, don't mention the past. Now, we should find a way to force Diana to come back and take her money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was left with only a small, poor company, and life without money was really hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Dad, let's talk about it when I finish filming, or at least ask her for money after the movie is released. My reputation cannot be tarnished now. Steven doesn't give me any more money because of Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She has evidence against me. Right now, killing her is our only option. Only the dead can keep secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was stunned. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up, feeling uncomfortable all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not having seen Paula since the divorce, he wondered how she was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always thought that Amelie was not as attentive as her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning that he was not feeling well, Paula would prepare the meals carefully to his liking and would also make him midnight snacks for his health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Amelie wouldn't consider him, and all the dishes she cooked for him were spicy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no midnight snacks at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's present health condition prevented him from eating spicy and greasy food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, always upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After divorcing Paula, he sensed that something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only found out yesterday that her parents had left Capitole to retire to their hometown.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was lost in thought, Paula came into view.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a black down jacket without make-up and carrying a thermos.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked towards Jeff, making him inexplicably nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, what are you doing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Paula recognize Jeff, who had noticeably gained weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered. Amelie provided him with greasy food every day, and his health rapidly deteriorated. His face was visibly swollen.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was never too late to take revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They still had a lot of time. Now, Jeff only had that small company, which would go bankrupt in a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had nothing. Paula wondered how long Amelie could hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula snorted, "Jeff, this is Diana's office. What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing. I just wanted to see her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula mocked, "Are you that kind, or are you here because you know she works here and that you can take advantage of her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff frowned and fell silent. After discovering that he was here to force Diana to give him money, she would definitely tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no. I am here to see her. Paula, how are you doing?" Having been married for decades, he really couldn't bear to part with Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could never forget her care and love for him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gazed at him, who was very corpulent and old. Without affection for him, she found him even more ordinary than any other man. "I am fine. Although I don't have much money, life is easy."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="609.html">« Prev</a><a href="611.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
