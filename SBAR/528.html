Cecil spoke confidently, maturely, and composed. There was none of that old frivolity remained, and he looked dazzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the livestream chat: [I was watching videos while taking a shower early this morning. I was putting on body wash when I saw this, and let me tell you, liking a video with your chin is no easy feat! Our Mr. Farley is just too handsome!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[If you have a boyfriend like that, what time would you come home? I wouldn't even want to leave the house. I'm totally in love with Mr. Farley. He is so charming!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Look at the reporter's face! He turned grim. He is talking about protecting the public, yet he hasn't even checked the facts before asking all those high-and-mighty questions. My husband is practically blushing from their ridiculousness.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Isn't there a saying, "Where there's smoke, there's fire"?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[And isn't there another saying, "When my husband proves them wrong, you'll be eating your words!"]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh at the witty comments. Cecil was still many women's dream man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Times are changing, but we will always be by your side. Hubby, keep it up!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another wave of amusing comments flooded in. Diana smiled, watching Cecil's calm and composed demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Cecil led the group to the construction site, with the quality inspectors following closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was sitting in her office, with Mario standing behind her. Both wore expressions of calculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the ever-composed Cecil, Queenie sneered, "He really doesn't know what's coming. At this point, he's still pretending to be calm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario sneered, "It's all just an act. Once they inspect the site and find the materials aren't up to code, Westwood development will be finished, and we'll be the ones to profit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought the same. She gazed at Cecil's calm face, her expression darkening. She thought, "That brat shouldn't be acting like this. He should be furious, arguing back and forth with the reporters. But Cecil is too calm, too composed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is everything set with Henson Group?" Queenie asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario frowned. "I arranged it three days ago. They've already pulled out. It shouldn't affect them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie nodded. She trusted Mario's work. Now, all they had to do was wait for the Farley Group's stock to plummet. They had already bought in heavily last time, and this would be another perfect opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Queenie and Mario watched the live stream the entire time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Steven and Evan were watching too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan asked, "Mr. Gellar, who do you think tipped off the authorities about the Farley Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven remained silent, his deep gaze fixed on the screen. After a while, he finally spoke. "Look into it. Queenie might be involved. She's always had her eye on the Farley Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan recalled the video of Queenie scheming against Helen and was shocked. He wondered, "Just how ambitious is Queenie? Is she really trying to swallow up the entire Farley Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said, "Mr. Gellar, as soon as the news broke, I had someone keep tabs on Queenie. She's been spotted near her studio, which is just down the street from our office." He was stunned that Queenie already had her own studio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven leaned back in his chair, his elegance carrying a seductive charm, calm yet restrained. He smiled faintly, "It seems she's done quite a few things over the years that we didn't know about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this, Evan said, "Well, it's a good thing you finally came to your senses, Mr. Gellar, and cut off her five million-a-month allowance. Not even her own parents could afford to give her that much. Mr. Gellar, you spoiled her more than they ever did! I can't help but be jealous."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="527.html">« Prev</a><a href="529.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
