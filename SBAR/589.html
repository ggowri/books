He thought to himself, "Did she really just tell Alexander to take care of himself? Is she treating him like some kind of wild beast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana flashed Alexander a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven couldn't stand it any longer. He grabbed Diana and started pulling her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few steps, he noticed Diana's bag was still on the bench. He quickly went back, picked it up, and then left with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slammed his fist on the table in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, you're crossing the line," he thought angrily. "How dare you keep dragging Diana away from me over and over again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched Diana leave, silently hoping she would get a divorce soon. That way, he could protect her without any restrictions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Steven got Diana into the car, he swiftly got in as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chill emanating from him made Diana shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to close the door, a slim hand reached in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped, but it was too late. Queenie's hand got caught in the door hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch..." Queenie cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, my hand hurts so much," she said, tears brimming in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and asked, "What are you doing? You saw me closing the door. Why would you put your hand in there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Queenie's red and swollen hand, Diana couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said with a grin, "Mr. Gellar, why don't you let your little sweetheart in? It's freezing out there, and her hand hurts. I'm sure you must be really concerned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned to look at her, irritation clear on his face. "What sweetheart? What are you babbling about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk! Mr. Gellar, Queenie's a woman, but she's braver than you. What's with the act? Are you seriously pretending not to know what you've been up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're getting more and more irresponsible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana leaned over him, opened the car door, and said to Queenie, "Ms. Marsh, hurry up and get in. The wind's strong, and it's cold out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you catch a chill, I'm sure Mr. Gellar would be heartbroken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven lowered his gaze, leaning against the car door. The faint fragrance from Diana enveloped him, warming him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the second time they had been this close. He found her scent intoxicating, and his eyes half-closed in a slight daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took the opportunity to get into the car, still crying. "Steven, my hand really hurts. Look, it's swollen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at her hand. It was a bit swollen but only slightly red. Queenie was making a fuss over a minor injury, acting like she needed to go to the hospital. Diana smiled and said, "Mr. Gellar, I won't keep you. You two should hurry to the hospital. If you wait any longer, the redness on her hand might fade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana opened the opposite door, chuckling as she quickly walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her leave with a smile on her face and felt a surge of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That woman," he thought, "she's learned to play games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what's she smiling about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does she look so pleased?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, get back here!" Steven shouted, but his furious voice was drowned out by the wind and snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Steven's attention was still all on Diana and no longer on her, Queenie said, her tone a mix of frustration and pleading, "Steven, my hand hurts. Can we go to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned at her, noticing the slight redness on her hand. He thought back to all the nasty tricks Queenie had pulled. She had even hurt herself before just to frame Diana. A faint, mocking smile spread across his lips. "Queenie, does it hurt a lot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie whimpered, "Yes, it really hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's smile grew colder and more deliberate. "Well, you deserve it. Who told you to purposely stick your hand in the door?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="588.html">« Prev</a><a href="590.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
