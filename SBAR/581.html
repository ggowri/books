He knew that the person was Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penelope was no longer useful. In order to avoid giving Penelope money and to prevent her secret from being exposed, Queenie directly destroyed Penelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was vicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gale realized it too late. Diana had reminded him, but he believed Queenie. He believed that his beloved sister would not hurt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gale was wrong and his legs were crippled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale looked at Kyle and said, "Kyle, this woman is my ex-girlfriend. She cheated on me. The child she is carrying is not mine. I was also deceived. Do you want to meet her? I will take you there. She is at the police station on the island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle said, "What? This is your ex-girlfriend. Are you blind? You are schemed against by your ex-girlfriend. You were this close to raising someone else's baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale thought about what he had done to Diana with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kyle, I understand all this now. It shouldn't be too late." Seeing his son, Gale wanted to stand up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not too late. Be a good person in the future. Everything is still in time." Kyle wiped away his tears and said gloomily, "Let's go and see the woman who forced my daughter to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale said, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went back to get something and saw Gale sitting in a wheelchair from a distance. He had already arrived at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned around and looked in the direction of the hospital. It seemed that Gale already knew about the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath. Even if he knew, he could do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took the things back and saw that Althea had fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana did not disturb Althea, but sat at the table beside her and read the plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the cooperation with Alexander and the large amount of business, she became very busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea's mother would come here tomorrow. With her taking care of Althea, Diana would feel at ease and could go home earlier. Althea would be discharged from the hospital the day after tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a very hard time for Althea to be in confinement during this cold winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana read the information carefully. Her cell phone kept vibrating. She picked it up and saw a news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a video of Penelope bullying a girl. Diana was slightly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Penelope bullied an innocent girl and caused her to commit suicide.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[The truth is revealed. Penelope has slept with hundreds of men.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned and suddenly thought of Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Queenie who wanted Penelope to never get out of the jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana." There was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised her eyes and saw Althea's mother coming in the snow. She was carrying many bags in her hands. And there was a lot of snow on her hat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood up quickly and went to help. "I thought you weren't coming until tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, thanks to you for accompanying Althea. She is stubborn. I asked her to go home, but she insisted on staying here. This place is remote, and the medical conditions are not good. What on earth is she thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea's mother complained. It was not a familiar place, and she felt uncomfortable staying there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Althea was stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Althea feels that winter is the same everywhere. She is familiar with this place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to speak for her." Althea's mother took off her hat, went to the bathroom, and clean the snow off her clothes..</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Diana gratefully and smiled, "Diana, thank you. I will take care of Althea. You should go home and get some sleep."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="580.html">« Prev</a><a href="582.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
