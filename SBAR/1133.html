Althea's face instantly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why are they here?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you doing here? You're not welcome!" Althea snapped, her voice sharp with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Gale only brought back the sting of his cruel words from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If there was one person she never wanted to see again in this lifetime, it was Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale looked at her with guilt in his eyes. She was even more stunning now. Motherhood had softened her features, making her even more radiant.  </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, I'm sorry. Everything before&mdash;it was all my fault. I was blind, I was a fool. The things I said to you... I'll regret them for the rest of my life. If you're angry, you can hit me, yell at me, whatever you need."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can walk again now. The moment I could stand, I couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t wait to come find you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea's gaze was icy. If apologies could heal wounds, hers would have mended long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Couldn't wait? Gale, have you forgotten what you said? Just leave. I even moved to get away from you. What more do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale lowered his gaze, his face filled with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He deeply regretted all the hurtful things he had said to Althea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula stepped forward and said, "Althea, I know we were wrong. You</span><span>'</span><span>ve probably heard about what happened with our family. Althea, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve taken care of everything. Only then did I dare to come see you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, let</span><span>'</span><span>s sit down and talk," Paula said, looking at her. She hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t changed&mdash;still the same kind-hearted girl as always.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paula, our families have known each other for years. You must understand what our move meant. We just don</span><span>'</span><span>t want any ties with your family anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea</span><span>'</span><span>s stance was firm. When she looked at Gale, her eyes were especially cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale was the man she had truly loved, but also the one who hurt her the most.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she no longer believed in love. All she wanted was to focus on her career and raise her child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Marie appeared at the door. "Althea, guests are guests. Let them come in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t pleased. It was a good day, and she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want them ruining her mood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of these people, her manners went out the window. She had no desire to ever see this family again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she had no choice but to let them in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale looked at Marie. "Marie, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marie let out a deep sigh. She had known about Gale for a while. He was often across from the villa&mdash;she had seen him multiple times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone headed to the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric set the gift aside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Steven and Diana there, Paula was thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, Steven, you're here too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and Steven gave a slight nod.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hadn't expected them to come either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige frowned slightly, staying silent. She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t like them either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat beside Steven, holding the baby in her arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"D-Diana..." Harlan's voice rang out clearly, instantly drawing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale looked at his son, who resembled him so much, his eyes glistening with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used to watch the child from afar, but now, up close, he realized just how much the boy resembled him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea," Gale turned to look at Althea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea knew exactly what he was hoping for. She replied coldly, "The child is mine alone. He has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's heart tightened, and he spoke softly, "Althea, you've misunderstood me. I'm not here to take the child from you. I just wanted to see you and him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The day the child was born, I went to see you. But I was already crippled by then, so I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t show myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea looked surprised. "How did you know?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A lot had happened the day she gave birth. If it weren</span><span>'</span><span>t for Diana, her son wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have survived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, how dare you bring up that day? If it weren</span><span>'</span><span>t for you and that woman, my child almost wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have made it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana sensed the danger ahead of time. She helped me switch rooms. Only then could my baby stay safely by my side after he was born."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know what I thought back then? If that woman had really hurt my son, I would</span><span>'</span><span>ve made sure both of you ended up in prison."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thankfully, Diana noticed the danger and switched the room, ensuring her son</span><span>'</span><span>s safety.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale knew the truth about what happened. "Althea, I was deceived by Queenie and Penelope. I know nothing I say now can change things. I</span><span>'</span><span>m not asking for your forgiveness. I just hope you</span><span>'</span><span>ll let me see you and the child sometimes. I truly regret everything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale stood straight in front of Althea, his eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking about everything he had done, he realized he had truly been a jerk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the once-proud Gale kneeling before her, Althea couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t hold back her tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale used to be so proud. But after paying the price, he had become utterly humbled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea let out a bitter laugh. Now he realized his mistakes and knew how to apologize.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was too late. Far too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gale, if you had come to me the day after at the hotel and apologized, I might have forgiven you. I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have left, and I would</span><span>'</span><span>ve kept the baby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now it's too late. I went through pregnancy at my lowest, endured the sickness, the pain of childbirth, and nearly fell victim to your woman</span><span>'</span><span>s schemes. I will never forgive you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea cried out, her voice breaking with anguish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears glimmered in Gale's eyes. He lowered his gaze, staying silent. He knew he was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t deserve forgiveness. He knew it was too late, but he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t give up on Althea and the child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea was the one woman in the world who loved him most. Before, he ignored her advice. Now, he was filled with deep regret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea was overwhelmed, her voice hoarse and trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his mom being hurt, Harlan wriggled out of Diana's arms. He stumbled over to Gale, raising his tiny fists, punching and yelling, "Bad... Bad, Bad!" His fierce defense of his mom touched everyone around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching his son</span><span>'</span><span>s tiny fists swing at him, Gale didn</span><span>'</span><span>t move. Instead, he smiled down at Harlan. This was his son, his own flesh and blood. In that moment, he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t describe what he felt&mdash;only that he was the happiest man alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale scooped Harlan into his arms. "Harlan, I</span><span>'</span><span>m your dad. If you want to hit me, go ahead&mdash;hit me a few more times for your mom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale cried like a child. He was overwhelmed with happiness, tears streaming down in pure joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After becoming disabled, he had thought about so many things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gradually realized that the simpler life seemed, the harder it actually was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching his son walk on his own, he felt pure happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no true friends by his side. It was then he understood&mdash;without money or power, he was nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he wanted nothing else&mdash;just to be with his son and Althea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harlan knew what "Dad" meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked up at Gale, his face lighting up as he happily babbled, "Dad... Dad."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1132.html">« Prev</a><a href="1134.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
