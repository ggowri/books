I just don't understand, I made way for Queenie, so why can't you all let me go?" Diana said with frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've said it before, I won't let you all bully me anymore. Steven, for every humiliation you inflicted on me in the past, I will slowly seek my revenge," Diana declared with determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered, "Having already killed me once, would they really want to kill me a second time?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, she wouldn't give them another chance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to buy yourself some time, go ahead. Once again, you all conspired against me, Steven, but I will retaliate fiercely," she declared firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You better protect Queenie well and don't let me find an opportunity to harm her," she cautioned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold gaze, Diana's voice turned chilling, resembling that of a demon. Yet, there was also an underlying pain that she struggled to contain. After speaking, she walked towards the elevator door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven tried to catch up, but he was stopped by the arrival of Queenie who stepped in his way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven," she grabbed Steven's arm, "I've been looking for you for so long. Didn't you say you would accompany me for lunch?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at Queenie with icy eyes and asked, "Queenie, did you go home last night and tell your parents that Diana stole your credit?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was startled and thought, "How... How does he know?" Queenie was startled and thought, "How... How does he know?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Queenie thought back to what happened last night, she felt angry. "Steven, I was just upset last night because you didn't accompany me home. I complained a bit when I got home, and who would have known that Diana would come looking for trouble with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Queenie Marsh, this is not just a matter of trouble. Can't you understand what Mr. James said? Diana spent four hours translating for me and helped me sign the contract. Don't you have any gratitude for that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Furthermore, since the divorce, she hasn't bothered me anymore. Why did you tell your parents that Diana was bothering me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I may have grown up with you, but I won't tolerate your lies time and time again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the icy gaze from Steven, Queenie was startled. Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked at him, appearing vulnerable and pitiable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did she realize that Steven had never addressed her by her full name before. A wave of panic swept over her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, this... it's not a big deal. I was just in a bad mood and vented a bit. What's wrong with expressing some frustration when someone is feeling down?" Queenie pleaded, trying to downplay the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But because of your lie, your mother came here today to confront Diana," Steven said, pulling his hand out from her grasp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking about Diana's painful expression, he felt an intense urge to give Queenie a good beating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ignoring Queenie, Steven calmly turned away with his handsome face, taking long strides as he walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula, who had followed them out, stood frozen in place upon hearing the conversation between Steven and Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana did not lie; Queenie was the one who lied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..." Paula remembered the hurtful words she had just said, and in a panic, she rushed to find Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was in a distressed state. Instead of taking the elevator, she decided to take the fire escape route. As she reached the dimly lit staircase, she could no longer hold back her emotions and sat down, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had thought she didn't care anymore, but her heart couldn't deceive itself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't hold back her pain any longer and began to cry uncontrollably. She knew that only by letting the tears flow could she find some solace and avoid feeling overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She believed that only by letting herself cry wholeheartedly could she alleviate her sorrow and not feel as overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven found Diana and saw her sitting on the stairs, crying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Furrowing his brows, he looked at her frail and trembling shoulders, feeling a deep sense of heartache.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought of approaching her, but his footsteps were halted by Diana's ringing phone.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="48.html">« Prev</a><a href="50.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
