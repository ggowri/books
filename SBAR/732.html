"How could this happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That bitch Diana actually called the cops on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the reporters' shocked expressions, Queenie forced a smile. "It is just a misunderstanding. I'll be out soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the crowd's suspicious looks said it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the police wouldn't take away someone innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, news of Queenie's arrest spread like wildfire online.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion saw the news and was floored. But the signing hadn't started yet, and he wanted to see if Steven would bail Queenie out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether she was guilty or not didn't matter much. A little stint in jail wouldn't tarnish her reputation. He could easily whitewash her image.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion also rushed to the police station. He had to know for sure if Steven would come through for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than half an hour later, Queenie was playing the victim online while Diana had deliberately exposed her lies about the fake pregnancy, causing the news to spread like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had even gotten Nolan to fan the flames, making sure the story went viral.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having lived through this once before, Diana wouldn't let Queenie get away with slandering her reputation anymore, whether openly or behind her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie would have to face the consequences of her evil actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sent Mario to find Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mario had no idea where to look for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing he could think of was to go to Steven's company and ask him about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being fiercely loyal to Queenie, Mario drove there, ignored the receptionist's protests, and barged straight into Steven's office using the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had just seen the news himself and smirked, pleased that Diana had handled things on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The solution was crude but effective - unless Queenie had actual proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But framing Diana had become such a habit for Queenie that she never bothered to gather proper evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Mario barge in, his handsome face was cold. "Don't you know how to knock? Did you feed your manners to the dogs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An arctic chill filled the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was taken aback but pressed on anyway. "Mr. Gellar, where's that bitch Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven grabbed a book from his desk and hurled it at Mario's chest, and then it hit the floor with another loud thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, you son of a bitch, that's my wife you're talking about. This is your last warning! If I ever hear you disrespect her again, I'll cut out your tongue. Now get the hell out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario flinched, his chest stinging where the book had hit him. He was stunned that Steven had actually acknowledged Diana as his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, don't forget that Queenie is the one you love. She's the only one worthy of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario clenched his fists, glaring at Steven in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's resolve was clearly wavering, and Mario could sense it. Yet he couldn't find the right moment to hypnotize Steven as planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the holidays approaching, even Queenie couldn't get a hold of Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's gaze darkened as he took a deep breath. So this was what everyone around him thought... no wonder Diana had walked away for good.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="731.html">« Prev</a><a href="733.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
