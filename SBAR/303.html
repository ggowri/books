Just like the Marsh family, you looked down on me because I came from the countryside, with nothing to offer. You thought I should be grateful for everything you gave me and never compete with Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what you wanted to give me wasn't necessarily what I wanted. Why should I be grateful for your charity? From the very start, you've treated me with contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I never needed your pity, nor did I care to compete with Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's heart felt as if it were being sliced with a dull knife, driving him nearly mad with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Steven left, Diana asked Luna to drive her to the Gellar Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Gellar Manor was located in Capitole's most exclusive neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to visit Helen here frequently on weekends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana bought some pastries Helen liked and went in alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The manor was peaceful, with fresh air and an elegant, luxurious design.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you're here," Helen said. She wore a white dress, her demeanor still graceful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Born into a noble family, even at seventy, she maintained an elegant presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana approached, set the pastries down, and hugged Helen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, I've missed you," Diana said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen gently patted her back and smiled. "Silly girl, if you missed me, why didn't you come sooner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at the kind face of Helen. She had been beautiful in her youth, and even now, her natural grace remained unmatched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, you know about me and Steven," Diana said with a bitter smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen took her hand, sat her down, and patted it gently. "Diana, Steven doesn't understand love. I know you've suffered. Give him time. He'll figure things out. Queenie's manipulative ways won't hold up, and eventually, he'll see it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "Grandma, you were young once too. When you love someone, you don't count the costs. Love comes with blinders; it makes you overlook their flaws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven and Queenie were childhood friends; they share many good memories. I know you care for me, Grandma, and you won't force me to stay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew Helen well enough to speak her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen patted her hand with a look of regret. "It's my fault for insisting. It's that boy who's unlucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. "Grandma, meeting Steven was like a burst of color in my dull life. I'm actually grateful to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was grateful for the push that gave her a chance to start over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen understood her suffering. "The Marsh family is full of ambitious wolves who can't distinguish right from wrong. You've endured a lot over the years, Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know you've made up your mind. I asked you here today to thank you for saving Steven's life back then. Without you, he wouldn't be here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied with a smile, "Grandma, everyone has their fate. It was meant to be that I crossed paths with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'm still grateful to you, Diana. You were with him during his darkest days. He's grown up now, but if he can't appreciate you, there's nothing more I can do. I just hope your life is peaceful and fulfilling from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having lived through it, Helen knew how easy it was to fall and how hard self-control and success were to achieve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, her grandson had already begun to spiral into self-destruction. Such a mindset could be terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a single month, a person could change completely and be driven into hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nodded with a smile. "Grandma, I loved Steven for four years, but he never loved me back. There's no fate between us. Loving him once dragged me into the dirt, but now I want to rise high. I won't betray myself anymore or waste my life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, I'll smile happily in a future without Steven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helen smiled brightly at this. "Diana, you're destined for greatness. No matter how much you love someone, never lower yourself to the dust for them. I told you this before, and now you've finally realized it."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="302.html">« Prev</a><a href="304.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
