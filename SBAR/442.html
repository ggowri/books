"Mr. Morrison, my brother won't let me race anymore. If I join your team, he'll be even angrier. He's already giving me the silent treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's a championship next spring. I'm grateful for today, Mr. Morrison. I can race for you in that championship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He seemed reasonable enough to make friends with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Elroy appeared to be just another spoiled rich kid, he secretly controlled a significant corporation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His influence couldn't be underestimated, and his connections were even more impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy laughed heartily. He looked at Diana's bright, spirited face, his eyes narrowed thoughtfully. "Ms. Bishop, excellent! Let's exchange contact information. I'll have someone deliver the land contract and all transaction documents right away. Tomorrow, someone will accompany you to the notary office. Once it's notarized, the land is yours. Don't forget to invite me over once you've built the villa."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and said, "Mr. Morrison, I won't accept it as a gift. I know you bought this land for twenty million dollars. How about I buy it from you for fifty million dollars?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a substantial piece of property, including half the mountainside behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the ocean in front, it would make a perfect resort development.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy wondered if the land value was about to spike but then thought the property was just at the foot of the mountain and was barely suitable for a village.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he'd already promised Diana, so there was no backing out. Plus, he'd make an extra twenty million and get a championship race. It was not a bad deal at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being a businessman, he wasn't about to pass up good money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Deal, Ms. Bishop. But what about your third brother... I mean, what about Eric?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric suddenly turned to Diana, but this time, he kept his mouth shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's smile was cold as ice. "Mr. Morrison, I've cut all ties with their family. Whatever happens to him is none of my business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was none of her business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you... we are..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana spun around, cutting him off. "Don't you dare finish that sentence. You don't have the right! Eric, we're done. End of story."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric shot her a fierce glare, sulking in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, whenever he got angry, Diana would always find ways to cheer him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't believe Diana would actually let him go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Elroy brought over the contract, and the rest of the procedure would be handled at the notary's office tomorrow morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the paperwork was settled, Diana was over the moon. She turned to Elroy and said, "Thank you, Mr. Morrison! I'll be heading out now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright! See you tomorrow!" Elroy waved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana grabbed the contract and made it to the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric stared at her with wide eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, are you really abandoning me? I'm giving you one last chance to save me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked straight toward the exit without so much as a glance in his direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric was dumbfounded. Diana had really walked away! "Did she actually come here just because of that piece of land?" he wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shouted angrily, "Diana, just because I called you out for messing with Queenie, you hold a grudge against me? You evil woman, you'll never measure up to Queenie! In my heart, Queenie is my only real sister. Who do you think you are to give me attitude?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, get back here!" Eric yelled with venom in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana walked away without even a backward glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric hung his head in defeat. Diana had really changed! She wasn't a pushover anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Elroy slapped Eric hard across the face. "Loser! Keep making calls until someone comes with the money. Then we'll let him go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric had no choice but to call his dad for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana found her path blocked by Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was shocked to see him. "What's he doing here?" she muttered.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="441.html">« Prev</a><a href="443.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
