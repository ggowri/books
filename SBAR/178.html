"Are you disappointed or happy to see me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil grinned mischievously, "I'm naturally very happy to see you. I'm thrilled that you've come to rescue me, really!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He spoke the last sentence with earnestness. The roguish charm about him toned down significantly, revealing a hint of steadiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've warned you to be more cautious, yet you still fell into the trap. Everyone learns from their mistakes, but what about you?" Diana was aware that he had been very careful. With issues at the branch company, he had been busy with company matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Despite my vigilance, I couldn't evade the framing." Cecil's charming eyes turned dark and profound in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly raised an eyebrow, looking at Diana's beautiful face. Her lips were attractive and soft, coated with a tender lip gloss, looking very kissable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil's gaze deepened. "If Queenie knew you were here to save me, she wouldn't let you off the hook."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you think I'm afraid of her? Besides, it's not necessarily her. There's no evidence," Diana sneered, watching as the police arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She handed a USB drive to the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Officer, we previously submitted an application to provide new evidence. This USB drive contains new evidence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing about new evidence, Cecil casually glanced at Diana, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His people had searched the entire bar and couldn't find any evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How did she find it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The police, upon receiving the new evidence, immediately launched an investigation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The evidence showed Cecil talking with several business partners in the bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Late at night, several partners got drunk and left one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two men were so drunk that they passed out on the sofa opposite him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only Cecil was leaning on the sofa, waiting for his assistant to drive and pick him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, a middle-aged man walked in quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With an evil grin, he secretly placed a bag of something into Cecil's bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A few minutes after this man left, the police came in, and there were still five people in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other five people indeed did something illegal in that private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The police found drugs on Cecil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The police saw this scene and the man who framed Cecil by putting drugs in his bag. They immediately realized the man was a repeat offender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We didn't detect your fingerprints on the bag. Once the video is confirmed to be real, you can leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The police finished speaking and left. Due to insufficient evidence, and it had been twenty-four hours, Cecil was released ten minutes later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Out of the police station, Cecil raised his hands high and stretched. A comfortable smile played on his handsome face, adding a bit of charm to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Finally, I've been vindicated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He tilted his head and looked at Diana, his voice sincere. "Thank you, Diana!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was curious where she got the evidence, but some things didn't need to be said. Otherwise, their relationship would become diluted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was looking out for him. In this world, friends as loyal as her were rare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cecil's tall figure loomed over Diana. He looked down at her, his red lips curved into a charming smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked up, her eyes meeting his smiling, charming ones. She felt her heart skip a beat.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="177.html">« Prev</a><a href="179.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
