"Are you Queenie's family?" the doctor asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven nodded. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor scolded him, "How could you be so reckless? Your wife is pregnant, yet you still had sex? Couldn't you just wait?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You almost lost your baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor continued, "There's still some fluid in her body. You need to be careful about hygiene; infections can easily happen. There's still a risk of a threatened miscarriage. I've prescribed medication for her. Make sure she rests at home, and absolutely no more sex for the next three months. How could you be so rough with her? She has internal injuries. Couldn't you be a little gentler?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury burned in Steven's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the doctor walked away, he muttered, "Young people today are really crazy. They use all sorts of toys and even risk their lives for a bit of excitement."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven clenched his fists, realizing how promiscuous Queenie was in private.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like a complete fool for being fooled by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't overheard the conversation between Diana and Cecil that night outside Marsh Villa or seen the photos on Diana's phone, he would have continued to believe that Queenie, whom he had watched grow up, was a kind person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now he saw her private life in a different light.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched as Queenie emerged from the examination room, her gaze cast downward, clearly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was anxious, thinking that Steven probably didn't know about her pregnancy. She had just instructed the doctor not to disclose anything to her husband&mdash;meaning Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what she didn't realize was that another doctor had already informed Steven of her condition. Medical professionals were obligated to share information about a patient's health and necessary precautions with their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood in front of Steven and forced a faint smile. "Steven, I'm fine. Let's head home."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. "Are you sure? Don't you need to stay in the hospital for a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie replied, "No, it's just a minor issue. Maybe I might be upset because of Diana. You know how mean she can be."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes, studying her. He sneered, "Queenie, you really are fragile. Alright, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was very hungry. She was pregnant. What should she do?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This child was Levi's, but she needed it to be seen as Steven's.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was pondering over how to manipulate Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only if the child became Steven's could Steven divorce Diana and marry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he found out she was carrying someone else's child, they would never be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shocked by her own pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, she didn't notice she had reached the elevator until Steven stopped and she bumped into his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't move, merely frowning slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned around suddenly. If it were any other time, she would have felt confident in convincing Steven, but his demeanor was different now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he could only be swayed if he were hypnotized into forgetting about Diana and convinced that his only love was Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she thought, she could find a way to plant the pregnancy on Diana. That would solve everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she needed to be careful; there couldn't be any mistakes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="625.html">« Prev</a><a href="627.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
