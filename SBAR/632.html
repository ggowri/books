Steven, don't play games with me. I'm not falling for your tricks."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was momentarily stunned. Reflecting on their past, he realized how deeply she had resented him, and how their relationship could never return to what it once was.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not playing games. I just want to show you our home. If you move in with me, Queenie will freak out," he said, his gaze softening as he looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana scoffed, "I'm not interested. You and Queenie are having a lover's spat, and I don't want to be a pawn in your game. I'm not going to do something so foolish."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising an eyebrow and smiling, she continued, "As for revenge, I'll handle that myself. After all these years of suffering, I've learned a lesson&mdash;I need to be myself first before I can be someone's wife or mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since leaving you, I've found myself, and I refuse to go back to who I was before."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana turned and walked inside. Since he wanted her to come in and take a look, she would oblige.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her retreating figure. In the wind and snow, her figure seemed very lonely, which made him want to hug her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed her inside, his usually cold expression revealing an unexpected tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan stepped forward to open the door, smiling widely, "Mrs. Gellar, please come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at him and replied with a smile, "Evan, we're friends, so just call me by my name."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's smile faltered as he heard Steven's footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He certainly wouldn't dare to call Diana by her name, afraid that Steven would give him a hard time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never dare to do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana ignored Evan and walked into the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa Steven had bought was a newly renovated space that had never been lived in. The decor featured his preferred gray and white tones, complemented by white wallpaper that suited her taste perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The layout was nearly identical to the one she had once lived in, with a spacious open kitchen that she admired quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the kitchen had been her favorite spot, where she studied various dishes to impress Steven, who had never appreciated her efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Steven, who stood under the light, appearing even more dignified and somehow softer.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't understand him. "Steven, you all alone in this big house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a three-story villa, while her current place was a four-story building.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped closer, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with her. "You'll be living here too, and we will have children."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of "children" hit Diana hard, and she felt a rush of emotion. "Steven, don't talk about kids. If it weren't for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she interrupted herself, coming back to her senses. What was she even thinking? In this life, she wasn't pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him with a mix of doubt and confusion, quickly clarifying, "I'm sorry. I mean, you and I will eventually divorce, and I plan to have children with the man I love, but it won't be with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Steven's expression grew colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea of her having children with another man struck him deeply. Suddenly, he pulled her into his arms.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="631.html">« Prev</a><a href="633.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
