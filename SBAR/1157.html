"Diana, you're absolutely outrageous. This is robbery, you're a thief. This land is mine. You must return it to me today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the roadside, a police car sirened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The police arrived, and officials from the relevant departments all came.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and pointed at the police, saying, "Alright, you can go to the police. If this land is truly yours, I'll return it to you. Otherwise, I'll sue you today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner lost his earlier arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie assured that this land was definitely his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only listened to her one-sided words and never investigated. Queenie said the most important goal was to stop them from starting construction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana and Steven brought in their entire legal team and called the police, while Tanner was left all alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His lawyer might not really help him win.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While entangled with Tanner, Diana had already messaged Joseph.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph is investigating this matter. What she needs to do now is to buy time for Joseph to sort things out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner and Queenie are working together, and Queenie will definitely have a foolproof plan. Her computer skills are top-notch; she won't lose in this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She might be able to hack the system and alter the data.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie has a plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner got scared when he saw the police actually show up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He did cause trouble here because he listened to what Queenie said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said this land originally belonged to him. Tanner thought so too, especially since he had proof documents in hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana called the police, and they even recorded a video at the time. She has evidence proving the land is hers, so he was really used today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana received a message from Joseph at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Diana, the land ownership documents were indeed tampered with. I&rsquo;ve restored the data and changed the name to yours.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saw the message from Joseph but still felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Joseph, keep an eye on it. We're heading to the police station to resolve the issue now. To prevent Queenie from causing trouble, drop a bomb into their company's system first.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[She's short on funds right now, so plant a virus in their system. In just half a day, they'll suffer heavy losses.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph replied: [Diana, I got it.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled with satisfaction. Steven watched her send messages the whole time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph is truly loyal to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The police arrived, and half an hour later, the relevant authorities looked at Tanner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had a bad feeling, pointed at the evidence in his hand, and said, "All this evidence proves it's mine, it couldn't possibly be Diana's."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The police and relevant authorities showed him the evidence in the system and the signing process between Diana and Elroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This land is not yours. The owner of this land is listed under Ms. Bishop's name. The construction site starts today, and all the procedures are compliant and legal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner thought helplessly, "Queenie lied to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn woman really used me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Tanner and said, "Tanner, you're suspected of forging documents and seizing someone else's property. That's against the law."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner couldn't escape Diana's sarcasm or the police investigation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "No, Diana, this isn't my fault. It's Queenie. She gave me all these documents and said this land would definitely be mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was tricked by her. Don't sue me. I won't bother you again in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Tanner ends up in the police station, his company will face big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said helplessly, "Impossible. Queenie deliberately sent you here. Her target isn't this land at all, but your new company. If you're arrested, your new company will fall into her hands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She doesn't have any working capital right now. Even if she takes this land, she won't have the chance to develop the resort."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So the project in your hands is what she really wants. Hasn't Mario been approaching you recently to discuss a lot of collaborations?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said anxiously, "How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, please help me. I really know I was wrong. I'm begging you, help me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Of course, I'll help you. I'll withdraw the case. Go back and deal with your issues."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana issued a letter of understanding and let Tanner leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The police and relevant authorities left. Diana's construction site started smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana personally tied a red flower ball on the excavator. This was something Olivia asked her to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the first day of work, she took charge of all the workers' breakfast and dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The construction site started smoothly, and Diana was very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leaving the remaining matters to Nolan, Steven took Diana back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting in the car, Diana looked at Steven and said, "Let's go. We're heading to Queenie's office."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and said, "Let Evan bring a few bodyguards over. If we end up fighting later, I don't really want to do it myself. Hitting people actually makes my hands hurt too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was going to watch Queenie and Tanner argue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn't miss this drama.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven arranged everything according to her instructions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Alright, now I'll take you to watch the show."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Steven said gently, willing to spoil Diana like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, all the computers at Queenie's company were infected with a virus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, with her professional team, kept trying to crack the virus. But twenty minutes passed, and she still hadn't succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie never doubted her abilities in this area; as long as there was a glimmer of hope, she could find a way out of any predicament.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But today, no matter what she tried, she couldn't crack the virus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it, who the hell did this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario watched from the side, equally worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Queenie, I suspect it's Steven and Diana. They've already investigated all your companies. These viruses are probably Diana's doing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie shook her head, firmly denying that Diana had such capabilities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible. It can't be her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario said, "Maybe it's Joseph."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie trembled all over. She remembered that because of Joseph, she made a fortune with the games and software he developed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was furious when she suddenly heard a voice. "Queenie, get out here."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1156.html">« Prev</a><a href="1158.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
