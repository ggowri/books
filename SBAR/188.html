"That's good news. You'll receive a generous bonus at the end of the year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you, Ms. Marsh. The Farley Group's stock has been unstable, constantly falling, and the shareholders are always causing trouble. Cecil is nothing but a spoiled heir; he has no business sense," Felicity said arrogantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie wasn't so quick to underestimate Cecil. "Felicity, don't underestimate him. He hides his emotions well. I've thoroughly investigated him, but Diana's plan failed in the end. You all need to be extra cautious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Got it, Ms. Marsh. We'll be careful," Felicity responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie hung up the phone, opened the door, and headed downstairs to check if Paula had taken her medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After coming downstairs, she saw her father watching Paula as she drank her medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's beautiful eyes hinted at a smile, but she still felt a bit suspicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How did she know? When did she start to suspect?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The paternity test had reassured her, but she still felt that something about Paula had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Paula take her medicine, Queenie decided not to go further downstairs and instead returned to her room to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She needed to look into Jace's preferences and refine her next plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After drinking the tonic, Paula pretended to be weak and leaned against the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jeff, what kind of tonic is this? The more I drink it, the weaker I feel. Lately, I've even noticed my memory getting worse. I keep forgetting what I need to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff's eyes flickered, realizing the medicine was taking effect. He smiled and reassured her, "Paula, you've been too busy with the company lately, running around stressed. Once this period is over, take a few days off to rest. Don't worry, I'm here with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula looked at him doubtfully. "Is that so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes! Trust me," Jeff replied, though his patience was wearing thin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Recently, he hadn't been able to regain his former vigor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was anxious. No matter what he tried, nothing worked. He went for a checkup, and the doctor told him he had been overusing medication.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But why did using it just once make it stop working permanently?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The thought of never experiencing that pleasure again terrified him. What was he supposed to do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was worse than death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To avoid raising Paula's suspicions, he hadn't dared to make any moves with her lately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh! So that's it. I'll go upstairs to rest. I'll figure out the company issues, so don't worry," Paula said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula was about to leave but picked up a brown bottle from the table. It was the aphrodisiac Jeff often drank. Handing it to him, she looked at him warmly, her gaze suggestive. "Jeff, I'll go bathe first. Drink this and come up when you're ready."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeff understood Paula's hint and forced a smile. "Alright! I'll be up soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Watching Paula's perfect figure, Jeff felt restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His body craved her, but his penis couldn't respond. At this rate, he would break down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Speaking of forgetfulness, he also noticed that he had been forgetting things a lot lately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Paula went upstairs, she turned back to look at Jeff sitting in the hall, a strange smile crossing her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jeff, you can't outplay me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Foliot's birthday banquet should be quite the show."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="187.html">« Prev</a><a href="189.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
