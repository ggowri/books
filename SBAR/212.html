"I reviewed the surveillance footage. He took photos before tearing up the designs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes reddened. For the past two years, she had handed over the company's matters to Nolan while taking care of Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she hadn't wasted those two years, her company would have thrived by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Men really only slowed her down from making money, she thought bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna drove Diana to find Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was at the garage today, inspecting his race car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked up to see an angry Diana approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flashed with disgust. "Diana, what are you doing here? I haven't even confronted you about framing Dad last night," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana strode over in fury. "Smack..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She raised her hand and slapped Gale hard across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What the hell, Diana! Are you crazy? You think you can just hit me?" Gale ground his teeth. His eyes flashed with rage, his once handsome face twisted with malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's eyes turned red again. She couldn't help it. Her eyes always welled up when she was wronged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Damn it, she didn't want to cry, but the tears came anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was filled with thunderous anger. "Gale, I always thought you were lazy and irresponsible, but I never imagined your character could be this rotten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You stole my designs and gave them to Steven's company, ruining all my hard work. Gale, you bastard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have any idea how important those ten designs were to me? They were supposed to determine my company's future, iconic pieces I spent three days and nights creating. And you secretly photographed them and sent them to Steven's designer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, you're worse than an animal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale froze, disbelief written all over his face. "Diana, are you out of your mind? Why are you accusing me? I may have taken photos, but I didn't send them to anyone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't try to frame me. Your dirty tricks won't work on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana pulled out her phone and showed him a video. "This is Steven's design department's new product launch, and it's exactly those ten designs you photographed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been caught up with Cecil's affairs and had put this matter aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it had given them enough time to launch the new products.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And you're the only one in my office and taking photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have evidence, Gale. How could you stoop so low?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale saw himself in the video. He had indeed taken the photos, but only because he thought the designs were good and wanted to show them to Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he had gotten busy at home and forgotten all about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I didn't do this. Don't accuse me. I may have taken the photos, but I didn't send them to anyone. I only meant to show them to Queenie, but I never got the chance. Check my phone if you don't believe me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale pulled out his phone and opened the gallery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he tapped it open, he was dumbfounded. The photos he had taken were gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What... I didn't delete them. Where did the pictures go?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="211.html">« Prev</a><a href="213.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
