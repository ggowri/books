"I've already told you I'm carrying Steven's baby. Why won't you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked triumphantly at Diana's pained expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath and asked coolly, "Then why did you lie at the press conference, saying you weren't pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie faltered, then sneered, "Diana, others might not know why, but surely you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's lips curved into a mocking smile. "Fine. If I call the police on you, others might not know why, but you certainly would, wouldn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her red lips parted in a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew perfectly well that Diana still held that card over her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's smile froze, her face turning ice-cold. "Diana, since you came here, you must want to settle this. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't want anything. If she hadn't left that day, she wouldn't have fallen into Zion's trap. Someone would have taught Queenie a lesson anyway. She didn't need to get her own hands dirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being locked up here meant she'd miss all the upcoming drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's simple. I won't tell anyone about your pregnancy. Whoever's baby it is, that's your business. But I want you to clarify that I never set you up publicly and that it was all a misunderstanding. If you don't, I have ways to let everyone know about your real pregnancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was a game of threats Queenie wanted to play, Diana could deliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being nice was hard. Being nasty was easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie bristled immediately. "No way! Diana, you better drop those charges right now, or else..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or else what? You'll kill me?" Diana cut in with a wicked smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clenched her fists, her face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's beautiful eyes sparkled with an unsettling brightness as she stared back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's be real, Queenie. We both know who's been plotting against whom all these years, and I've got proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abandoning your adoptive mother, framing your sister... once this gets out, your career is finished. I'm here to help you, to make peace. But if you're not interested, that's fine by me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fixed Queenie with a penetrating stare, her lips curving into a knowing smirk. She could play this game.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie found herself unable to grasp Diana's intentions fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she needed to do was clear up the misunderstanding and claim she hadn't meant any harm. It seemed simple enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only years later did Queenie suddenly realize that Diana's actions today were not about forgiveness but about inflicting a far crueler punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing her options, Queenie agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went to explain her terms to the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the police station entrance, Queenie had gathered the media. Facing the cameras with tears in her eyes, she spoke with practiced vulnerability. "Dear friends, fans, and netizens, I'm Queenie. I apologize for taking up public resources like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My recent conflict with my sister has attracted widespread attention and discussion, and for this, I feel deeply remorseful.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, I want to offer my sincere apologies to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened between my sister and me started as a misunderstanding. I foolishly believed someone's lies and rashly assumed she had tried to sabotage me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, after thorough communication and understanding, I've discovered this wasn't the case at all. Someone has been working behind the scenes to slander us, deliberately creating conflict between us for their hidden agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this point, I still don't know who this person is.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm begging everyone to stop attacking my sister on social media. We've reconciled, and all misunderstandings have been cleared up..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="733.html">« Prev</a><a href="735.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
