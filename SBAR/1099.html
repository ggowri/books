I</span><span>'</span><span>m so incredibly happy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was his truest feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His overwhelming desire to be with Diana made it hard for him to hold himself back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze, unmoving, her eyes brimming with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her soft hand gently brushed against the back of his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The involuntary motion surprised even herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an unconscious gesture from Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt her soft touch and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing by the window, Diana could clearly see the tenderness in his eyes and his smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, every emotion Steven showed was genuine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart was racing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t imagine this scene happening to them, or that expression on Steven</span><span>'</span><span>s face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before knowing the whole truth, Diana had always felt they were never meant to be together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t imagine such a tender moment would ever happen to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears slipped from Diana's eyes before she even realized it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know what was wrong with her, but she felt like crying again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched her tears fall and panicked. "Diana, did I hurt you? Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I don</span><span>'</span><span>t know. I just feel like crying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A lot had happened recently. The truth had left her completely shaken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Honestly, Diana still couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t figure out her own thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ever since she found out Steven wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t the one who caused her death in her past life, her heart had been wavering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she needed time to process everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would stay by Diana's side, using his love to help her forget the pain of the past.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, it probably won't rain. Let me take you out for a walk. The scenery on the island is amazing. Let's go pick some coconuts. I remember your coconut seafood dish was incredible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, surprised he still remembered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Let's go. I don't want to stay home all day either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staying home only made her overthink.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took her outside. The island was his, not very big. There were several villas on it, but this one by the sea had the best view.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other side of the island was owned by another billionaire, who only visited once a year. Steven had only heard about him but had never met the man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held Diana's hand as they walked out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spring breeze was chilly. Diana pulled on her hat and stuffed her hands into her coat pockets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stopped and said, "Diana, wait here. I'll go back and grab a coat for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head. "No need. Just grab a basket. We'll pick some coconuts to bring back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced around the villa, spotted a basket in the corner, walked over to grab it, then returned to her side. Taking her hand, he led her out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The island was deserted. Fishermen would occasionally stop by to sell seafood when passing through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was easy for them to buy seafood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sea breeze drifted in, carrying a faint chill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana faced the sea breeze, her hair tousled by the wind, brushing against Steven's face. He caught a faint, fresh scent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stayed close to her. He loved the subtle fragrance she carried&mdash;it always helped him sleep peacefully at night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, let's go over there. There's a white sand beach. It's beautiful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at the white sand beach in the distance and said, "Sure! The island</span><span>'</span><span>s all natural beauty. Must cost a lot to maintain every year, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly looked at him and asked, "Have you brought Queenie here before?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After his eyesight got better, he started disappearing for months at a time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head. "I would never bring her to the island. Back then, I just wanted Charlie to think I really adored Queenie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was planning to wait until I found my mom before making a move."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I waited for years and still couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t find my mom. If it weren</span><span>'</span><span>t for you showing me that photo, I</span><span>'</span><span>d never have known there</span><span>'</span><span>s a man in this world who looks exactly like me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I never touched Queenie. When I saw the photo, I was completely shocked."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That was when I realized there was still a chance for us. I never wanted to divorce you because I knew I could protect you in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hadn't expected him to find out the truth this way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She laughed through her tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her, feeling heartbroken again, and held her hand tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cut him off with a sad smile, "Pity it took me two lifetimes to realize there's a man who looks exactly like you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Last time, it was those photos and videos that made me give up on you completely. Too bad there's no 'what if,' only the outcome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt she had been so foolish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She should have asked Steven back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "If I had shown him the video back then, would we have had a different ending?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "If back then I hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t hidden the photos and showed them to you like I did this time, maybe we could</span><span>'</span><span>ve had a good ending."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t stop replaying it in her mind, imagining the what-ifs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those photos haunted her, constantly gnawing at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially after Diana got pregnant and Steven kept her confined in the villa, she truly felt like she was suffocating in there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She often had those impulses back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt like the dumbest person alive, completely played by Queenie. It was unbelievable, yet it had all happened, undeniably real.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Of course, I was in so much pain back then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't continue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven held her tightly, his voice filled with pain. "Diana, it won</span><span>'</span><span>t happen again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, you can ask me anything. I'll always tell you exactly what I</span><span>'</span><span>m thinking."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gentle voice couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t soothe Diana</span><span>'</span><span>s wounded heart this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned against Steven, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she thought of Jenny. It felt like she had overlooked something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "By the way, how did you handle things with Jenny? From what I remember, she gave so much for you. Even after she lost her mind, she</span><span>'</span><span>d still smile at me and tell me to stay by your side."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I still remember the day you sent her away. She kept looking at me, crying. Did you two make some kind of deal back then?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1098.html">« Prev</a><a href="1100.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
