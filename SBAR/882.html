"How could you get caught for such a small thing? I gave you so much money, and you haven't brought me any useful information. Instead, you've been discovered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had planned to use Zora to frame Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for her pregnancy and the upcoming surgery that delayed her plan, Diana would already have been in big trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Diana was living happily, while everything in her own life was going wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora said anxiously, "Ms. Marsh, Helen said she found evidence. I don't know what it was, but she called the police to arrest me. What should I do? Everything I did was under your orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shifted all the blame onto Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought for a moment and said, "Zora, the police are after you because you stole Helen's jewelry. Return everything you took and act as if nothing happened. When the police come, just make an excuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora listened and thought Queenie was clever, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, I understand, but I already sold most of the jewelry, and I've spent all the money," she muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was irritated by how foolish and greedy Zora was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snapped, "Zora, I've known you for years. You've never been satisfied. Do you know the value of those jewels? It's hundreds of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid you'll never get out of jail? If you don't leave any evidence behind, you might save yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, don't tell anyone I was involved. If you do, your son might spend the rest of his life in prison. I have evidence about him. Think carefully before you speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already told you what to do. Whether you succeed or not depends on you. I'll protect him, but if you fail, both of you might end up in jail. Decide carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Zora cared most about her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora understood she was being threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, she had taken enough money from the Gellar family. She had bought a villa and saved a lot for her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied, "Ms. Marsh, I know what to do. If I get caught, I won't expose you. But you must protect my son. I've given evidence of your involvement to a friend. If anything happens to my son, that evidence will go to Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora knew Queenie well. She was ambitious and greedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after all these years, she hadn't married into the Gellar family to enjoy wealth and status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Zora, a mere servant, had lived comfortably in the luxurious mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even had cars to take her shopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie wasn't good enough to marry into the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not before, and maybe not ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was shocked by Zora's threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been the one to threaten others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was used to being the one in control and getting whatever she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the tables had turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snapped, "Zora, I didn't expect you to be so shameless. How dare you threaten me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora chuckled, "Ms. Marsh, dealing with someone as cunning as you, I had to be careful. Steven may spoil you, but he never planned to marry you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helen and Edward have made it clear many times. They only recognize Diana as their granddaughter-in-law. Never you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're angry, blame those two old ones. They're the reason you have no chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora hung up, satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had stirred up trouble for both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she couldn't have peace, neither could Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora quickly called her son and explained everything before returning to the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen had plenty of money, and Zora felt justified in taking jewelry from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora had worked hard for years, taking care of everything for the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Zora came back, Helen was having breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora wondered why Helen was still healthy. She had been secretly poisoning Helen with slow-acting toxins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the new chef had ruined her plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meal was served by the chef and another maid, not giving her any opportunity to poison it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Helen died, she could walk away with around 20 million dollars worth of assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gellar family was just too rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No ordinary people could accumulate such a fortune in their lifetimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Helen saw Zora enter, she knew Zora had heard the phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had spoken loudly on purpose so that Zora could hear. Helen had grown up in a family battling for position, so dealing with a sneaky, underhanded housekeeper was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Zora didn't know was that Helen's phone had surveillance, and she could see their every move. Last time, Diana had told her Zora was working for Queenie, so she had prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the time was right, she would let Zora panic first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment when a person was terrified was not when the truth came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen had also heard the phone call in the garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie thought she was clever, believing everything was under her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen had already sent the video to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now her only ally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zora, where have you been?" Helen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora froze, even though her smile was so loving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora stammered, "I went to the backyard. The view was nice this morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excuse was flimsy, but Helen seemed to buy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen said, "Oh! You have quite the interest, huh? On such a cold morning, you still like to go and enjoy the view? There's so much to do in this villa, and you still have the energy to look at the scenery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora panicked, unsure of Helen's meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't dare to make eye contact with Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen narrowed her eyes and pointed to the kitchen. "Go have breakfast. Only with a full stomach will you have the strength to struggle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip to cover her growing nervousness. She looked at Helen, who was old yet elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That innate elegance made Zora jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zora felt unfair about her lowly origins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was frozen in place, Helen spoke up again. "Today's breakfast is very rich. Aren't you hungry?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="881.html">« Prev</a><a href="883.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
