He wanted her entirely, and that desire had never wavered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie gave a slight nod, her tone cool but charged with meaning. &quot;Cecil sent me an invitation to the Farley family&#x27;s banquet. He&#x27;s been waiting for this—tonight, he&#x27;s probably planning to humiliate me. But before he makes his move, we&#x27;ll give him a show to remember.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">For Queenie, nothing mattered except power and wealth.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had walked unfamiliar roads, met countless strangers, and never once felt lonely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario&#x27;s smirk deepened, his voice laced with malice. &quot;Understood, Ms. Marsh. Don&#x27;t worry; I&#x27;ll make sure you leave with your head held high. The only one eating dirt tonight will be Cecil, that entitled little trust-fund brat.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His eyes flashed with jealousy. Taking down a privileged heir like Cecil? Child&#x27;s play.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He despised people like Cecil—born into luxury, handed everything without lifting a finger. Meanwhile, he had clawed his way up from nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just because Cecil had money, did he think he could manipulate people like pawns on a chessboard?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie studied Mario&#x27;s expression, the raw envy simmering beneath his cool exterior. He had always harbored a deep-seated resentment toward men like Cecil—those who had it all from birth while others struggled for scraps.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Two men, both human, yet their fates couldn&#x27;t have been more different.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she trusted Mario. If anyone could handle this, it was him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;One more thing,&quot; she added, her voice crisp. &quot;Take Sandra with you. She&#x27;s meticulous. I want Cecil Farley&#x27;s reputation in shambles by the end of the night.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">If she wanted to win, she had to be ruthless. Hesitation was a luxury she couldn&#x27;t afford.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mario hesitated for a beat before asking, &quot;Ms. Marsh, do you want George to go with you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The thought of George made Queenie pause. Then, with a flicker of amusement, she nodded. &quot;Let him know. He&#x27;s coming with us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George had been calling her all day, but she hadn&#x27;t bothered picking up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had been in a foul mood. Torn between love and hatred for her parents.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They were her only family, but forgiveness was out of the question. Instead, she would make sure they lived in misery.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie closed her eyes, exhaling slowly. Mario cast her a concerned glance but said nothing as he turned to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ten minutes later, George stormed into her office, his energy as wild as ever.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie barely glanced up. She was lounging on the couch, flipping through documents, already dressed in an elegant champagne-colored gown.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now that she no longer had to play the fragile, innocent girl in front of Steven, she dressed entirely for herself. She liked to look untouchable—like someone no one dared cross.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The wealthy admired her. The weak feared her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With her flawless figure and striking features, the gown draped over her like it had been made for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she no longer leaped into George&#x27;s arms, whispered sweet nothings like she used to. And that realization hit him like a punch to the gut.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That, and the fact that she had ignored his calls all day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He dropped onto the couch beside her, his arm sliding around her waist like it belonged there. &quot;Queenie, why the hell weren&#x27;t you answering my calls?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She finally looked at him, her expression unreadable. A slow, cool smile curved her lips. &quot;I was busy. My mother lost her mind; my brother is dead, and my father had a stroke. I wasn&#x27;t exactly in the mood for small talk.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Every time she needed him, he was conveniently nowhere to be found.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Funny how that worked. Every damn time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A flash of guilt crossed George&#x27;s face. His grip on her tightened. &quot;Queenie, I&#x27;m sorry. I was away on a business trip. I should&#x27;ve been here for you. Have you made arrangements for your parents?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She let out a light laugh, twirling a strand of hair between her fingers. &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s handled. They&#x27;re no longer of any use to me. I sent them where they belong. They&#x27;ll live out their days in suffering—however long that may be.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The smile on her face was bitter. She had nothing left to give them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George understood. More than anyone, he knew what she had wanted—she had once dreamed of a happy, perfect family. But her parents had crushed that dream. They had been selfish, and in the end, they had left her with nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And that made him want to protect her even more.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Come on,&quot; he said, voice gentler now. &quot;I&#x27;ll take you to the banquet. From now on, I&#x27;m staying by your side.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie met his gaze, and for a brief moment, the warmth in his eyes stirred something deep inside her. He was the only one who was truly hers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alright,&quot; she said, standing up gracefully. &quot;Let&#x27;s go. George, with that face of yours, you could land us half the business deals in this city. You&#x27;ve been tracking Steven&#x27;s every move—by now, you know exactly how he operates. I don&#x27;t need to spell it out for you, do I?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George chuckled, tilting her chin up with his fingers. His voice was laced with amusement. &quot;Relax. The second they see me, they&#x27;ll know what&#x27;s up. Tonight&#x27;s the perfect opportunity to announce our company. And trust me, with Steven&#x27;s reputation? Those investors will come running to us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil&#x27;s banquet was set in the grand ballroom of his luxury hotel.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The venue dripped with elegance—fresh-cut flowers cascaded over polished tables, gourmet dishes were arranged like works of art, and the air buzzed with the soft hum of live classical music.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Inside the opulent hall, guests moved in a sea of designer suits and glittering gowns. The rich aroma of fine wine and decadent cuisine filled the space, setting the stage for a night of indulgence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil led Diana to the main table, where an array of her favorite dishes had been meticulously prepared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her gaze swept over the table, a small smile playing at her lips. The effort was obvious—Cecil had paid attention to every detail.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Keeping her voice low, she tilted her head slightly. &quot;Cecil, what exactly are you planning tonight?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His expression darkened, a glint of something dangerous flashing in his eyes. He leaned in, his voice just above a whisper. &quot;Three years ago, she destroyed a girl&#x27;s life. I found that girl. Tonight, she gets her revenge.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana instantly knew who he was talking about—the pianist who had taken her own life because of Queenie. It had never been fair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meeting Cecil&#x27;s gaze, she warned in a calm but firm tone, &quot;Be careful. I&#x27;ll be here, waiting for the show.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil&#x27;s grin widened as his gaze landed on Queenie and George stepping into the ballroom. He leaned closer, lowering his voice. &quot;Queenie&#x27;s here. Diana, sit back, enjoy the food, and watch. This whole event? It&#x27;s for her.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana glanced toward the entrance. Queenie was draped in luxury, radiating wealth and power. The murmurs in the room were unmistakable—some whispered behind cupped hands, others stared openly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A few greeted her, and she responded with a poised, effortless nod.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil&#x27;s excitement was barely contained. His voice had a sharp edge to it. &quot;Diana, I need to take care of something.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She gave a slight nod, watching as he moved through the crowd. The deep crimson of his suit made him stand out, turning heads as he passed. He carried himself with an air of easy confidence, every step deliberate.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But an uneasy feeling coiled in Diana&#x27;s stomach. Something about this night felt off.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She turned to Luna, keeping her voice low. &quot;Luna, keep an eye on Mario. That man is slippery. I don&#x27;t trust him, and I don&#x27;t want him pulling anything on Cecil.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna raised an eyebrow, looking doubtful. &quot;Diana, this is the Farley family&#x27;s event. You think he&#x27;d try something here?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana still felt uneasy. She turned to Luna, her voice firm. &quot;Go now. Mario isn&#x27;t with Queenie—he&#x27;s definitely up to something.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her instincts had never failed her—Mario was the kind of man who played the long game, always calculating his next move.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna hesitated for only a second before giving a quick nod. Without another word, she turned and hurried off, slipping into the crowd to follow Cecil&#x27;s trail.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1017.html">« Prev</a><a href="1019.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
