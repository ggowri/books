"Let's not jump to conclusions. We need to hear what the authorities say first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his words offered Queenie no comfort. Instead, panic washed over her, and a dull ache spread through her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled. "No, this can't be happening. Finding an ancient tomb on the very first day? This project is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She collapsed into her wheelchair, feeling as if she had been thrown into the depths of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over. Everything was over. This project was supposed to elevate her company to the next level. Without it, all the money she had invested would be lost, and she knew exactly what that meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked at Mario. "Mario, do you understand? This project is worth over a billion dollars. Just like that&mdash;it's gone. How much compensation do you think the authorities will give me? You know the answer as well as I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A billion-dollar loss&mdash;this would set her company back by a decade. The only reason the business had been thriving, growing steadily and securely, was because of Steven. Staying by his side had given her access to insider information, lucrative deals, and valuable partnerships. On top of that, Steven gave her millions of dollars every month, allowing her to expand the company behind the scenes, making bold, aggressive moves without fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Steven was gone. She had no one to shield her. George was unfamiliar with the business operations here. For the past few days, Queenie had been pushing him hard to get up to speed with Steven's empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Edison's help, they had managed to secure a few deals&mdash;but they were small, insignificant in the grand scheme of things. They wouldn't be nearly enough to keep the company afloat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath before speaking to Mario. "Mario, take me over there. I need to see it with my own eyes to believe it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fists clenched tightly on her lap, her voice barely above a whisper, drained of all strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't believe in karma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dead were just that&mdash;dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life went on, and the living thrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was gone, and yet she could feel everything was slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, with Paula protecting her, she had been untouchable, a princess sitting high above the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, there was no one left to shield her. She had to face everything on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario pushed her forward, and as they approached, the sight came into full view&mdash;an ancient tomb unearthed beneath the excavator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tombstone, still caked in dirt, bore the unmistakable weight of history. Even the sculpted portrait beside it had begun to emerge from the soil. She knew exactly what a discovery like this meant to the archaeological world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This project was dead in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind raced, scrambling for a way out, a solution&mdash;anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she took in the scene before her, it felt as though something sharp had stabbed straight through her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt. A deep, unbearable pain that made her want to scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did things come to this?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had been able to develop this land, the future would have been hers. She would have made a fortune, solidifying her place among Capitole's financial elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the dream. But the moment she saw that tombstone, she knew&mdash;her dream had shattered beyond repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a man approached and asked, "Miss, hello. I'm in charge of the excavation of this tomb. Are you the project lead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie closed her eyes for a moment, then gave a small nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the officials spoke, "I'm sorry, but we've uncovered an ancient tomb here&mdash;along with an underground palace. This land can no longer be developed. We'll have to discuss the next steps later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie squeezed her eyes shut in agony. If it were just a tomb, it could be relocated. But an underground palace? This land was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had bid on this land too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had driven up the price&mdash;then walked away without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he known? Had Steven already known about the tomb and the underground palace?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie struggled to believe it, but the more she thought about it, the more uneasy she felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Steven well. This property had enormous potential, and yet he had abruptly backed out. At the time, she had taken his withdrawal as a victory&mdash;she had outmaneuvered him and won the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Steven know? Did he intentionally raise the price only to make a show of walking away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie murmured the thought under her breath, her voice barely audible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instructed Mario to remain behind and handle the aftermath, then told her driver to take her away. She just couldn't bear to be here anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she reached the parking lot, she was met with an unexpected sight&mdash;Diana and Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's expression hardened as she stared at them coldly, suspicion flashing. "What are you doing here?" she asked warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil stuck out his tongue playfully, a wide, smug grin spreading across his face. "We came to watch you cry. Your eyes are all red&mdash;must've been a pretty good meltdown, huh? Hurts, doesn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hadn't shed a single tear earlier, but at that moment, Cecil's taunting words struck a nerve. A tear slipped down her cheek, this time out of sheer rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly wiped it away, her gaze turning ice-cold as she fixed her eyes on Diana and Cecil. Her voice trembled with fury. "Diana... Cecil... Was this your doing? Did you set me up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised both hands and wiggled her fingers with an exaggerated shrug. "Now, now, let's not be dramatic. You fought tooth and nail to buy that land all on your own. How exactly did we 'set you up'? What, do you think we had X-ray vision and somehow knew there was a tomb buried underneath?" she asked, a teasing lilt in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stared at Diana's bright, carefree smile, but all she felt was a bone-chilling cold spreading through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her long lashes trembled slightly, and a bitter taste lodged itself in her throat, making it hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp ringing filled her ears, the sound of her fury and humiliation echoing in her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her gaze, her heart twisting in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil frowned and looked at Diana. "Diana, why is she taking this so hard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath, eyeing Cecil, who spoke so casually&mdash;like someone with nothing at stake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, she couldn't handle it. She had gambled on the wrong outcome. In her version of the future, Paula's billions of dollars were hers. Your family's fortune was hers. With all that wealth, she believed she could finally have the perfect life, a real home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the truth is, her parents never really loved her. She gambled everything on the idea that she was the rightful heiress of the Marsh family. And in the end, she lost. Her father never cared about her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words struck Queenie like a blade to the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had lost, and it was because her parents didn't love her. Because they could never provide her with the family she longed for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been so sure she would win against Paula. But in the end, she had lost&mdash;completely and utterly. Paula had played her masterfully, putting on a grand performance&mdash;pretending to be left with nothing, orchestrating their father's divorce, making it all seem like she had been cast aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Queenie had fallen for it. She had believed every word of Paula's lies, only to end up with nothing but a hollow, worthless company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back, it seemed like she had been pulling the strings, manipulating others. But in the end, she was the one who had been played.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she still couldn't figure out where it had all gone wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie fixed her gaze on Diana. "Diana, you knew about my plan all along, didn't you? Even about Madam Farley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the pretense had long since shattered, bringing up the past hardly mattered. Rita had no proof anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and nodded. At this point, there was no need for secrets. Some things could finally be laid bare. "That's right. I knew you were planning to take down Madam Farley. You poisoned the pool, after all. But do you know why you lost? It wasn't bad luck&mdash;it was your arrogance. You were too confident, blindly believing that everyone would take your side. That's how you lost." Diana's smile sharpened. "So tell me, Queenie&mdash;was it a loss you can accept?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1004.html">« Prev</a><a href="1006.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
