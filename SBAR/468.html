Not only was he a jerk, but he was also an irresponsible coward.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven, I despise you. You&#x27;re a coward,&quot; she retorted, seething with anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven pressed his lips together, knowing that, given those photos, Diana would never believe him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, Diana&#x27;s phone buzzed. She glanced down and saw a message from Luna: [Diana, the Farley family is throwing a party tonight. Mr. Farley invited us to go together.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana quickly typed back: [Sounds great!]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven saw the message and realized she was close to Cecil.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Evan,&quot; she said to Evan, &quot;can you pull over? I need to get out.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;No way,&quot; Steven interjected. &quot;Have lunch with me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana shook her head. &quot;I already had lunch with Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Besides, Mr. Gellar, I waited hours for you before. I&#x27;ve done my time. I&#x27;m not having dinner with you again.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven lowered his voice, &quot;Sorry, it was my fault.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana was stunned, looking at him in shock. Was he actually apologizing?</p><p style="text-align:left;">It felt like he&#x27;d been possessed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In all her memories, except for those two years, Steven had always been cold and distant</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing him look genuinely regretful was a surprise. &quot;Steven, apologies don&#x27;t suit you. Don&#x27;t do it again. All I want right now is to be single and buy a big house.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan asked, &quot;Ms. Bishop, why do you want a house?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled mischievously. &quot;To throw parties with hot guys, of course.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Infuriated, Steven quickly grabbed her neck.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana gasped, startled and in pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His expression darkened. &quot;Diana, are you really that desperate?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tears welled up in Diana&#x27;s eyes from the pain. &quot;Steven, let... let me go.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing the tears, Steven released her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana coughed a few times, gasping for air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her neck throbbed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s anger flared again. &quot;Diana, no husband would want to hear what you just said.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana looked at him subconsciously. &quot;Husband? You&#x27;ve never admitted that, so don&#x27;t start now—it&#x27;s just gross.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven let out a chuckle.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana regarded him warily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven looked at her meaningfully. &quot;So, if I admit I&#x27;m your husband, you&#x27;d come back with me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana said, &quot;You wish. You&#x27;re out of your mind. Go find your crazy lover.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I have to say, you and Queenie make a perfect pair. She&#x27;s crazy, and you&#x27;re arrogant.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was speechless with anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana had a knack for pushing his buttons.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, Diana&#x27;s phone rang. Seeing that it was Joseph calling, she answered. &quot;Hello!&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="467.html">« Prev</a><a href="469.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
