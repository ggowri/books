He and Yanson had been so quick to judge, refusing to listen to her side of the story and just assuming the worst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had let their biases take over, and every time they saw Diana, they were irritated for no real reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of what they believed about Diana came from Queenie's words, and they'd blindly accepted it. Of course, every time they ran into her, they couldn't shake that feeling of annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all of that had been a setup from Queenie. She'd been feeding them lies, painting Diana as the villain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And their own arrogance had kept them from seeing things differently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, when it came to Steven, Diana had shown a whole new side of herself, one with real skill and ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was absolutely furious. Yanson, with his impulsive streak, had acted out in public, and now he had made a mess of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand why Diana always seemed to get away with everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, with Steven backing her, it was easy to push Diana around. But now, things were different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was livid. She could barely hold herself back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yanson, next time you see Diana, just avoid confrontation. She's gotten way too cocky, acting like she can do whatever she wants just because she's a president. If you make the first move, she'll hold onto it forever and use it against you. She did it to me before. If Steven didn't protect me, I'd be in serious trouble by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson's eyes were burning with anger, but the taste of blood in his mouth was all he could focus on. He wasn't even hungry anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen took a deep breath, realizing something for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't incapable. They just hadn't been aware of their position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe if he distanced himself from people like Queenie, he'd be better off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her talk again only made him feel disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up and said, "Yanson, your face is swollen up so much. Let me take you to </span><span>the hospital. At least get some treatment so you can eat properly for Christmas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yanson was in agony, and the cold air made it feel even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, there's a chunk of flesh in my mouth that's gone bad. The taste of blood is so bad I can barely stand it. This is ruining my Christmas." He gritted his teeth, wanting nothing more than to take out all his anger on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never felt so humiliated in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I'll go to the hospital. You and Steven head back first." His words were slurred from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes were full of concern. "Alright, Yanson, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Owen and Yanson had left, Queenie quickly called Mario.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh." Mario's voice was quiet, almost cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face darkened as she asked, "Well? Did you manage to sign Kara yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario's voice dropped to a whisper. "No, she ran off. But Brandon says he'll get her back tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was confused. "Why would she run? She's desperate for money. If we offered her a job, she should've been grateful. Why would she escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario was just as frustrated. "It's Brandon's fault. He brought her in, and after having a few drinks, his true nature came out. He tried to make her sleep with him and offered Kara an unfair contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He brought the deal to the table, but now he wants to split the earnings 50/50 with her. We gave her great terms, but after his stunt, she ran."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's anger flared up, her eyes narrowing. She couldn't believe Brandon was this greedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even secured the contract yet, and he was already thinking about dividing up the earnings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sure that Brandon's greed would be the end of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go after Kara. Offer her the best deal possible and get her to sign with us. She's a talented designer. She'll be huge one day. In the jewelry world, she'll make waves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario answered, "I'll get to it, Ms. Marsh. I'll try to reach her first thing tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Queenie looked around but didn't see George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was puzzled as he had been gone for quite a while now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up, grabbed her phone, and headed off to find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day was Christmas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana woke up early and called Leopold and three brothers to wish them a Merry Christmas, but Hubery still wasn't responding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had sent her a Christmas gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was so overwhelmed with happiness that she almost cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of joy in her eyes, she hobbled over to the window and shouted, "Hubery, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she heard in response was the biting wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't bother her. She was still over the moon. Clutching her phone, she sent Hubery a bunch of cute emojis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery: [When did you get so cheesy? So dramatic.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the message, Diana huffed and replied with an angry emoji.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her three brothers, she could always act spoiled, and they would indulge her without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing that Hubery hadn't replied, she didn't get upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just sat down on the couch and texted Leopold instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Grandpa, when are you coming back?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold replied with a voice message, "Sweetheart, I'll be back in April next year. I met up with Edward, and we've started a company here. We're setting things up for you, giving you a solid backing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was a bit taken aback and curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Grandpa, I've divorced Steven. I don't want anything to do with the Gellar family anymore.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold's voice came back, full of amusement. "How fake. You've taken all his assets, and now you're saying you're done with him? My granddaughter really enjoyed that divorce, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a little irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been trying to live as honestly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this second life, the only thing she wanted was to live authentically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tossed her phone aside and didn't bother replying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting up, she limped downstairs, wondering where Steven and Evan had gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had handed over the company to her because of his injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was frustrated with herself for still worrying about Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the kitchen, Luna, Nolan, Nick, and Barry were all busy cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt incredibly happy. Aside from Luna, the other three men were all amazing cooks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but think tonight was going to be a feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked into the kitchen with a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! With three handsome chefs like you guys, I'm going to eat until I can't move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan, Nick, and Barry all chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, as long as you're happy, we're making all your favorite dishes," said Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana grinned, settling down on the couch, content. As the patient, she didn't have to do a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna looked at her with concern. "Diana, do you think Evan and Mr. Gella will enjoy the Christmas tonight?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="956.html">« Prev</a><a href="958.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
