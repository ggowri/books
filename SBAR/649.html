Knowing how extreme Lily could be, she feared something even more terrifying might happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily suddenly commanded, "Guys, come here. Get everyone from the Marsh family and the Staggs family out of here. From now on, the Foliot family's events will not welcome them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine froze for a moment, staring at Lily in shock. "Mrs. Foliot, my mom is your close friend! How can you treat me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sneered, raising an eyebrow at her arrogant demeanor. She thought, "Tsk, she is spoiled and dumb."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Staggs, look at the people around you. All the young ladies here are from prominent families. Do you hear them saying a word like you? You're just an overbearing fool, a daughter from an ordinary family. What do you think you are? You don't even realize you're being used as a pawn. If your mother knew she had such a stupid daughter, she'd die of anger."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's words were always direct, so direct that she could send someone straight to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lowered her head slightly, her shoulders shaking as she held back laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her trying to suppress her laughter, Steven found her inexplicably endearing, and his gaze towards her softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine, on the other hand, was left speechless by Lily's tirade.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my! Mrs. Foliot, what's going on here?" came Cecil's playful voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dressed in a light blue pinstripe suit. If it weren't for his carefree aura, he might have exuded a sense of calm authority. However, that vibe was thoroughly undermined by his roguish air.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at his handsome face and smiled even more cheerfully, "Cecil, you're late! You missed the show. These few are quite filthy, so I'm kicking them out."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was utterly straightforward, and her face-slapping attitude made Diana feel an indescribable satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she had been so caught up with Steven that she never took the time to explore the world outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Queenie was quite ordinary in front of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only within the Marsh family and in front of Steven did she shine the brightest, radiating her unique halo.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's boundless indulgence only made her malice escalate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this life, with Diana's rebirth and intervention, Queenie ended up ruining her own happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had just stayed quietly in the Marsh family, her brothers would have continued to pamper her endlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie loved her mother dearly and always sought to clear her mother's name. In her previous life, she succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paula saw their happy family together, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted it with all her heart, but by then, she was already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, she thought she had been quite foolish, overly generous to the point of lacking any sense of measure, leading to a life marked by scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She firmly believed that if her kindness was given to everyone, it would only make her own life more miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in this life, she decided not to be overly forgiving. She only wanted to be strong enough for the world to treat her gently in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil glanced at the group, and finally, his eyes landed on Queenie's face with a hint of mischief in his smile. "Oh, Mrs. Foliot, this Ms. Marsh here. She's rumored to be Steven's fianc&eacute;e. How could she possibly be 'filthy'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, his face darkening as he roared, "Cecil, shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil cast a sidelong glance at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked at him, thinking to herself, "Good job."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everyone knew that Queenie was Steven's fianc&eacute;e, then Jeff and Amelie would do whatever it took to make sure Steven married Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, Queenie would be able to exact her revenge without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but think it was perfect, absolutely perfect.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="648.html">« Prev</a><a href="650.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
