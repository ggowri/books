Expose that Levi's new love, Queenie, is pregnant, and then post the video you took at the hotel online."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't take responsibility for such a disgusting matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan said in shock, "Oh my God, Mr. Gellar, are you okay? How could Queenie be pregnant with Levi's child? Mr. Gellar... If you want to cry, I can come over and keep you company."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Evan was expressing concern, his voice was filled with schadenfreude.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, who was very annoyed at first, heard Evan's sarcastic tone and laughed in anger. "Evan, you can tell me if you want to lose the job. Remember, don't use our company's PR; use the branch company's so that Queenie and the Robinson family won't be able to trace it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, don't fire me. But it's okay if you don't want me; there are plenty of companies that would love to have me work for them, haha..." Evan laughed heartily and then hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smashed the phone in anger, it fell on the sofa and then on the ground, but there was no crack on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat down in his office chair, feeling restless and lost in thought since there seemed to be no room to make Diana change her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had recently been reviewing the year-end financial reports. The news of the Staggs family's bankruptcy had already been published, and Queenie saw Steven taking action for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she realize the serious crisis. Steven was really no longer under her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That plan must be carried out. She shouldn't have hesitated before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just about to call Steven when she saw a message that made her whole body tremble with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A news headline stating that the lead actor, Levi, and the leading actress of Shadow in the Palace, Queenie, were seen entering a hotel late at night together, along with the news that Queenie was pregnant, almost made her faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also records of Queenie's medical records on the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was just thinking about using Diana's reputation to get an abortion and then destroy Diana, just as she had discussed with her mother last time tomorrow. Now, such news that was suddenly exposed slapped her in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizen A: [Isn't Queenie Steven's fianc&eacute;e? Has she cheated on him?]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizen B: [Who knew? I used to really like Levi, but I didn't expect him to be involved with Queenie. It's so disgusting.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizen C: [Queenie really has no shame. It's said that Mr. Gellar invested in this movie for her, yet she betrayed him like this.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizen D: [It's understandable, actually. Levi is an award-winning actor and a powerful man in the industry. No matter whom Queenie chooses to follow, she would gain access to better resources.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Netizen E: [This disgusting woman really thinks of herself as a star! There was a sensational cheating scandal at the Foliot family's party, which involved her mother. She is just as disgusting as her mother.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to her weak condition from pregnancy, Queenie was about to faint. She knew that the movie she worked so hard on was ruined!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="697.html">« Prev</a><a href="699.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
