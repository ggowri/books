I'm a proud guy, and if this gets out, it'll be a real mess. If people find out I ditched Paula the moment she went bankrupt, I'd be drowning in spit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really didn't want to go down this road. If it weren't for Paula's financial ruin, he wouldn't have even considered the divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents had always treated him well, unlike Amelie's folks, who were as mercenary as they come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff felt a knot of discomfort tighten in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie scoffed, rolling her eyes. "Dad, you really have no shame. You're worried about what others think? You're the one who tricked Paula into marriage! And to top it off, you've got a whole bunch of kids to deal with. Now I'm stuck cleaning up your mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Having a lot of kids isn't the worst thing in the world. I just didn't expect them all to turn out to be deadbeats..." Jeff trailed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "My kids might not be the brightest, but they treat me okay. My oldest is always overseas, just asking for cash every month. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that he might have a knack for business, I wouldn't be sending him a penny of my hard-earned money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was getting lost in his thoughts, his phone rang. It was his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jeff Marsh, um... we have a serious situation. The company's been sold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's heart dropped. "What? How could that happen? I'm still running things here! Who would dare sell my company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Paula. She's the legal owner of the company. Apparently, she's in deep debt and someone came to buy it out. She sold the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! It's my company! How could she sell it?" he shouted, disbelief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jeff Marsh, don't you remember? A while back, you were worried about your health and the company's future. You transferred the legal ownership and shares to her, and you personally signed off on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't! When did I ever give her the company?" Jeff stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "There were some documents that needed my signature when I was feeling unwell and seeing things. Was that when it happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I actually instruct her to take over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice rose to a fever pitch. "No way! There's no way I'd hand over my life's work like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face flushed with anger, veins bulging on his forehead, eyes wide with a mix of rage and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has to be a setup! Someone's pulling strings behind the scenes&mdash;this is a conspiracy!" Jeff flailed his arms, his voice cracking with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Onlookers stared, shocked by his outburst, but no one dared to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shot him a disapproving glare, clearly embarrassed by his display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's face twisted in frustration as he continued to rage, his body trembling with fury, "My company! I've poured my heart and soul into building this, and now it's just gone? I won't let this happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to get to the bottom of this! I will find out exactly what's going on!" He panted, feeling like a wounded animal ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice on the other end of the line continued, "Mr. Jeff Marsh, we're in the process of being cleared out. There are tax evasion issues, and I've already hidden the records. If the authorities catch wind of this, the company would be liable for far more than it's worth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me to send you the documents or what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was left speechless, his mind reeling with the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like the sky was falling around him. He gazed out at the snow-covered city, his heart heavy with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His company was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Send... send the documents to me. I can't let anyone find out about this."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="571.html">« Prev</a><a href="573.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
