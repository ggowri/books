"What do you want?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Steven felt defeated by her disdain and indifference. Suppressing his jealousy, he replied, "Let's go upstairs and check out our room."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried he might do something reckless, Diana reluctantly followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The master bedroom was on the second floor. Steven led her inside, revealing a spacious room decorated in soft gold. The background wall was simple and colorless, yet still elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "It's nice. Do whatever you want. I've seen it, so I'm heading back now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven blocked her path. "Stay, and let's live our lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was rarely this gentle. Having been ostracized since childhood, he often hid behind a cold facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aloof demeanor kept most people in the Gellar family at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, whenever he faced Diana, he found himself lowering his guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Queenie always appeared kind and considerate around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the angry Diana, Steven subconsciously leaned more towards Queenie's words, overlooking the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was about to refuse when Steven's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took it out and saw it was Queenie calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sneered, "I'm leaving. Your precious Queenie is looking for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Steven hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned, shock written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen how much Steven valued Queenie. Every little scrape Queenie had made him panic. Yet now, he didn't answer her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check if anything's missing from the room. I'll have someone get it," Steven said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Diana was about to insist that she had everything she needed and wouldn't be staying, his phone rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, visibly annoyed, Steven turned it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared in disbelief as he switched it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven hung up the phone on Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually hung up on her? She had a stomachache today. You should be with her in the hospital," Diana said, turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," Steven said nonchalantly, standing behind her, "if you try to leave, Tobias' overseas project will be gone, because I'm involved in that too. Tobias has impressed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven learned about Tobias' identity, he was genuinely surprised. He found out Tobias had graduated from a prestigious foreign university and excelled in various areas. Besides, he was good-looking and gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven remembered the sight of Tobias and Diana sharing a meal as siblings, him feeding her while she smiled&mdash;a smile she had never shown in front of him. That thought fueled Steven's jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started at Diana, the look in his eyes turning increasingly intense, his jaw clenched tight, exuding a powerful vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't decipher his emotions. All she sensed was his anger. "Steven, you're threatening me," she said, glaring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed the distance, and a strong sense of oppression overwhelmed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned down slightly, his eyes locking onto hers, his voice hoarse. "I'm only asking you to stay here for a while. After that, you can do whatever you want. I won't stop you. But about Tobias... I didn't intend to use him to threaten you, but it's you who isn't cooperating."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not cooperating? She couldn't accept that explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't believe Steven could control Tobias.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She should have realized that Steven's tricks were shady. He had eavesdropped on her conversation with Alexander. What had he done while she was taking care of Althea for that half a month that gave him leverage over Tobias?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="632.html">« Prev</a><a href="634.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
