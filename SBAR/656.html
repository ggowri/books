She thought, "Does that old witch Lily know that I'm the mistress? And if so, does she know other things too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe she had gotten herself into such an impossible situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Jeff, who was slumped in defeat, her eyes turned cold. "Dad, treat my mother well from now on. You're not allowed to hit her again. Do you have any idea how much she's suffered for you all these years?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know full well how many business deals she pulled in with Mark's help. Without Mark, do you think your company would have gotten this big with just Paula's support?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But my company is already gone," Jeff muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't even sure when exactly he had handed the company back to Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that period, he had been in a terrible state, constantly drifting through life in a daze, plagued by hallucinations.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, he would wake up in the middle of the night with an eerie feeling that someone was watching him from the side of the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That bone-chilling sensation left him scared out of his wits.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff sighed heavily, looking at Queenie with a serious expression. "Queenie, given how far things have gone, you need to make a decisive move. I don't know who's supporting you from the shadows, but I know they want to bring Steven down. But Steven loves you. Marrying him is your best shot at happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so good about that illegitimate son? After all you've done for him, does he even understand your heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie pressed her lips together, remaining silent. She knew she couldn't rely on anyone. She had to depend on herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the deed was done, and she would never regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paula's behavior was perplexing. Queenie's eyes turned icy. "I suspect tonight's events were a scheme planned by Paula and Lily together."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff furrowed his brow, his face darkening with anger. Paula had lost everything. Even the Barnes family estate had been sold off.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking carefully, Jeff muttered, "It's possible. Now that she has nothing, she knows you're my biological daughter, she knows about my relationship with your mother, and she knows about the deceitful marriage. Given her strong-willed nature, she's definitely plotting to get back at us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce murderous intent flickered in Queenie's eyes, and she urged her father, "Dad, for the sake of our family's happiness, Paula needs to be taken care of. She's like a leech that won't let go. I never want to go through something like tonight again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was utterly humiliating. I've worked so hard just to escape the stigma of being a bastard, but tonight's incident exposed me completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing more agitated, Queenie shouted, "All my efforts were for nothing! Everything I've worked for over the years has gone to waste, don't you get it? And now, with your divorce being public, I'm even more of a bastard in everyone's eyes. All those years of effort have been wasted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was devastated, collapsing to the ground in tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his daughter in such pain, Jeff felt utterly defeated as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was hoarse as he spoke, "Queenie, don't be too upset. Now that your mother and I are officially married, the four of us can be a proper family. When Gale comes back, things will be easier for you. You're becoming stronger every day. As long as you have money and power, no one will dare call you a bastard."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie understood this logic, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't want the truth about her background exposed so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, she wanted to wait until she achieved success. Once she had reached the top, all these scandals would be overshadowed by her brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Queenie stood up, remembering Paula's harsh words from earlier. She quickly pulled out her phone and checked the trending news.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the screen, the headline read: [Queenie, the Ungrateful Heiress of the Marsh Family.]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="655.html">« Prev</a><a href="657.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
