She persuaded Tobias to collaborate with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They each went their separate ways to rest at the airport, planning to attend Jace's birthday banquet that evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Steven also returned to Capitole with Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Steven arrived home, Steven noticed someone in the house and immediately assumed Diana had returned to steal the divorce papers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He frowned and strode into the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Queenie sitting on the sofa, a flash of coldness appeared in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was dressed up beautifully in a pink evening gown, her makeup refined, making her look sweet and innocent, the kind that brings out a man's protective instincts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned. "Queenie, what are you doing here?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing his icy tone, Queenie looked at him with grievance. "Steven, you let me stay here before. While you were gone, I've been living here. You're the only one who makes me feel safe. We grew up together, and you promised you'd marry me when we were older. A man should keep his word," she said, her voice breaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And you can't let Diana come between us and push me away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After speaking, Queenie walked over to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All her clothes had been cleared out by Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She realized Steven genuinely suspected her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This wouldn't do. He was coming back soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Gellar family's fortune should go to him, but how could someone like Steven, who grew up neglected, deserve it all?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's tall figure approached her with a stern look. "Queenie, I was clear last time. I won't marry you. You were trying to drive a wedge between us from the start," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's breath hitched, and silent tears streamed down her face. "Steven, are you still the same Steven I used to know? Why are you betraying the promise between us?" she sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What promise? Queenie, when I had that car accident years ago, the cause was never found. I'm going to reopen the investigation," Steven stated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's hand, resting on her knee, trembled, and her pupils quivered uncontrollably at his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, Steven didn't notice Queenie's reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Wasn't that car accident back then an accident? Why investigate it again?" Queenie probed, trying to keep her smile gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven didn't respond. Instead, he called Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar," Evan answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes. Get the cleaning service over to clean and disinfect the house," Steven instructed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie stared at him in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did her elegant appearance mean nothing to Steven?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No, what mattered was that Steven found her repulsive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She cried angrily. "Steven, is it because you saw that video Diana showed you? There's nothing between me and Harry. It's edited! Why won't you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven narrowed his eyes. "I didn't know about you and Harry. How do you know there's a video?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze bore into her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie choked on her words, her eyes darting away. "Diana once threatened me with that video," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tonight at the banquet, she would make sure Diana suffered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven pointed to the door, his voice void of warmth. "Leave," he commanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked at him pitifully and said gently, "Steven, please don't make me leave. It's Mr. Foliot's birthday banquet tonight. You and Diana have no feelings for each other. She's never accompanied you to these events before. I was always the one by your side. Let me go with you tonight, okay?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="192.html">« Prev</a><a href="194.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
