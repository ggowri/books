They had met at the wrong time, with so many misunderstandings between them. Diana truly no longer wanted Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice choked with emotion. "What a pity! You two seem so well-suited. Diana is kind and gentle. When she's happy, she's like a girl, cute and pure. But when facing enemies, she's mature and composed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan paused, lowering his head to eat. He was feeling distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hated how ruthless Andrew and Queenie were. It was because of them that they couldn't be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, too, was feeling upset. He only realized his regret after he had lost something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ate dinner in silence. A tear fell from Evan's eye and landed in his bowl. He swallowed both the tear and his food together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven noticed it, and it made him feel even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the food in his bowl, unable to eat it, but he forced himself to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to recover his health quickly so he could secretly help Diana and win this battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George's plans would end in vain. They had waited for more than ten years, and in the end, they would gain nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the surprise he had prepared for them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next few days, they would be furiously angry. Afterward, they would start plotting to kill Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was he who had put Diana in danger. This time, he would make sure she didn't get hurt again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Steven took his time opening the folder on the table. He flipped straight to the last page.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he saw that there was no biological connection, Steven understood and felt a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading it, he handed the paternity test to Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan took one look and was shocked. "Mr. Gellar, how can this be? You two look so alike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sneered and said, "If there is someone who looks like me, then it wouldn't be strange if there is also someone who looks like Andrew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was stunned, his jaw hitting the table. It already hurt, and now he opened his mouth in shock, tears streaming down his face from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly wiped his tears and used a tissue to wipe his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered under his breath, "Wait, Mr. Gellar, what's going on here? How could your father not be your real father? No... how could you not be your father's biological son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was in complete disbelief. Over the years, having been around Steven, he had learned about some of the things in high society, but this was just too absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes darkened, his tone mysterious. "My grandfather has been abroad for the past two years. He's also been in Raventia, and he might have been investigating this matter. Perhaps he knows the truth but doesn't want to tell me, fearing it will put me in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's also one thing. Why did my grandfather insist that I marry Diana a few years ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two things were still a mystery to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before marrying Diana, my grandfather made me sign an agreement, and I signed it without hesitation. At that time, nothing was more important to me than gaining control of the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he was full of arrogance. He hadn't experienced all these challenges and hadn't grown up yet, so he had let Diana down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another reason was to prevent George and his illegitimate child from taking control of the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had agreed to his grandfather's request because that agreement involved Diana, and he had no fondness for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't understand why his grandfather had pulled Diana into this situation with the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there was Diana's grandfather, who had suddenly visited his office and told him that Diana was the one who had saved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, he never suspected Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, thinking back, the true culprits were Queenie and Jeff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was clear now, but what still puzzled him was his grandfather's actions and the secrets behind Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather must have known something, which was why he made him marry Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven, being rebellious by nature, disliked such arrangements. This was also why he had no feelings for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, when he got into trouble, Queenie left. He realized that Queenie had been repulsed by his disability. But what he didn't know was that during the time Queenie had left, she had been with George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan trembled slightly, his hand shaking as he put the paternity test on the table and said, "Mr. Gellar, what do we do next besides taking care of Queenie and George?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous glint passed through Steven's eyes. "Felicity has helped Queenie with many illegal things. I had you send people to keep an eye on her. Now, she's involved in the acquisition of the Foliot family. This woman is very skilled. She's an elite in Queenie's circle and one of her trusted subordinates. The issue with Jace exposed her. Back in Woodston, we couldn't track down Felicity's whereabouts. Queenie has some assets in Woodston. And she has more people than just Felicity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie chooses collaborators who are capable, and she prefers to recruit from the poor. Her charity makes them loyal, and she can control them more easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, she targeted Cecil from the beginning. She intentionally went to save Mrs. Farley to gain the Farley family's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there was an unexpected turn. She set a trap that day but stayed with me the entire time, and Diana ended up saving her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Farley was poisoned and unconscious. Queenie took the opportunity to say she saved her. In the hospital, Cecil hit Diana. At that time, I didn't suspect Queenie's intentions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he had truly been blind both in sight and in heart. No wonder he had been set up by Queenie without even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after hearing Diana's conversation with Cecil that he realized Queenie had someone behind her. But he had still held on to a faint hope that Queenie wouldn't team up with her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had overestimated things. Queenie's true love had always been George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the paternity test in his hand, Steven said, "Destroy the paternity test. Now is not the time to confront them head-on. This matter involves the Mysterium Organization. We need to investigate whether Andrew is connected to this organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Act discreetly. Until we identify the people behind them, we can't expose this matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was likely even more complicated than dealing with Queenie and George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George were already in the open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Mysterium Organization? They had only scratched the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had only heard rumors about this organization and couldn't even find where they were located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was their connection to the Gellar family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to Andrew?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had to be investigated thoroughly before he dared to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, in the end, things were working out. But it was Diana who had to suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan understood. He nodded and smiled, "Mr. Gellar, I understand. We'll stay low for now. This matter won't be exposed just yet. What are your plans for Felicity?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="926.html">« Prev</a><a href="928.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
