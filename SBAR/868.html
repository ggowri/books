Janet was convinced that it was all because of this woman. She believed her plan would have succeeded today. Carolyn's stomach </span><span>hurt</span><span> because she had drugged the water, intending to kill both her and her baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, don't trust this woman! She's in cahoots with Carolyn! They're working together to swindle your money. You can't believe her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Young family raised me, and you've always been so good to me, Sam. Can you really bear to hurt me? Can you really let these people frame me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet's voice rose in fury. This woman had appeared out of nowhere and ruined all her plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Young family had treated her so well that she had started believing her own act, thinking she was truly their daughter. That delusion drove her to covet everything the Young family had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned, her gaze fixed on Janet's venomous expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a classic case of biting the hand that fed you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam let out a cold laugh, his eyes as frigid as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at her twisted face and recalling the evidence he had uncovered, his fury reached a breaking point. "Janet, you're shameless and selfish. You admitted it yourself just now, and I've found the proof. If it weren't for Ms. Bishop today, your plan would've worked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To kill Carolyn and her child, rob me of my heir, and wait for me to die in some 'accident'...did you really think you could take over everything the Young family owns?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet froze, staring dumbly at Sam. She thought, "Does he have the evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carolyn's gone to look for her phone earlier but hadn't found it. Has Sam taken it before I could?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam raised </span><span>the</span><span> phone and glared at her. "Janet, I've seen all the suggestive messages and photos you sent Carolyn. And the videos, too. So this is what you've been doing behind my back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the shadows, you've done countless cruel things to Carolyn. You even teamed up with your friends to humiliate her. Carolyn came from a small town, worked her way up to Capitole, and fell in love with me. What did she ever do wrong? What did the Young family do wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You're the one who came from the countryside. Your parents died young, and my parents took you in out of pity. They raised you like their own, and this is who you've become? An ungrateful wolf? Your studies were abysmal, and all you cared about was indulging yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Young family treated you like a lady, hoping you could rise above your circumstances. We gave you privileges most people can only dream of. But instead of cherishing it, you schemed to devour the entire Young family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, you've disappointed me beyond words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, as someone born in the mountains, where do you get the arrogance to say Carolyn isn't good enough for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's voice trembled with pain. He realized that this girl had indeed been spoiled by the Young family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that indulgence had ruined her, making her appear sweet and innocent in front of them while being vicious and reckless behind their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet realized everything had been exposed. She collapsed onto the ground in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "It is over. Completely over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Young family will cast me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes shot to Diana, and she screamed with rage, "It's all because of you, you wretched woman! If you hadn't appeared, Carolyn and that bastard in her belly would've been dead! You ruined my plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly leaped to her feet and lunged at Diana, shoving her with all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, watch out!" Sam shouted in panic. Behind her was the staircase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lurched backward uncontrollably. She shut her eyes, bracing for the pain of tumbling down the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of falling, she found herself enveloped in a warm embrace, held securely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She heard Steven's deep, soothing voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes flew open, locking onto his worried, dark gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why...why are you here?" she asked, startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had come to find her for dinner. He suspected she hadn't eaten lunch, given everything that had happened that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd run into Tom, who mentioned Diana was here. Taking a detour through the staircase, he'd arrived just in t</span><span>ime to catch her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't had dinner. I came to take you out. Are you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I'm fine. Thank you for saving me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wriggled out of his arms, but Steven clung to her briefly, savoring the feeling of holding her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sensation he didn't want to let go of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's stomach rumbled faintly. She hadn't eaten all day. But she had promised Carolyn she wouldn't leave. Janet was still here, and that woman was dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't go. There are things I need to handle here," she declined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven turned to Sam. "Mr. Gellar, your wife has safely delivered. I'll take my wife with me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam recognized Steven immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing him call Diana his wife, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know Steven that well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was the first he'd heard of Steven being married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your fianc&eacute;e is Queenie, isn't she? Steven, let me tell you, you'd better not take advantage of Ms. Bishop. She's a lifesaver to the Young family. Don't you dare bully her," Sam warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's expression darkened. He hadn't expected Sam to doubt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does everyone think Queenie is my wife?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Steven's sullen face, puzzled by his sudden claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, stop saying nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their marriage could only last for a year. She'd agreed because of his grandparents and his threat against Tobias.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven arched a brow. "Did I misspeak when I said you're my wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was calm but carried a hint of teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana clenched her fists and whispered sharply, "Steven, don't push it. We're getting divorced in a few months."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was low, meant for his ears only.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had a cold smile. He didn't plan to divorce at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let's go have dinner. You skipped lunch, and you won't want to upset your stomach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suffered from stomach problems himself, and after Diana had left, they had worsened. The pain was excruciating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't leave," Diana insisted. She didn't trust Carolyn to Sam's care alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven seemed to understand her thoughts. "Diana, Mr. Young seems like a decent man. Let him handle his family matters. It's not your concern."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head and refused him. She didn't want to have dinner with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. Carolyn asked me to look after her child. I promised her I wouldn't leave until she wakes up. Go eat by yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned slightly but said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam cast a glance at Janet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet met his icy gaze and shivered with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, you just tried to commit murder!" Sam roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, momentarily distracted by Diana, had almost forgotten that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one could hurt my wife. Mr. Young, I'll file attempted murder charges against her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Janet gaped at Diana in disbelief. "Mr. Gellar, your wife is Queenie! How could it be her?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="867.html">« Prev</a><a href="869.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
