How dare he talk to me like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario had met Tanner several times and knew who he was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario had no idea why Tanner was here. At this time, Tanner should be competing with Diana for land.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had a bad feeling and said, "It's Tanner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie frowned. The office door was suddenly kicked open.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked toward the door. Tanner glared at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pointed at Queenie and yelled, "Queenie, you liar. You tricked me. That land isn't mine at all. Didn't you say I would win?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But not only did I not win, I was humiliated. The police think I'm crazy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie snapped, "Impossible. I already took care of it. That land is yours. Diana is an impostor. You could easily take the land back. Idiot, what did you do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She clearly tampered with the records.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nonsense!" Tanner ran over, exhausted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, all the documents are under Diana's name, not mine at all. Are you messing with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie felt quite frustrated. The company's issues were still unresolved, and she was worried about losing confidential files, constantly trying to crack the virus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Tanner came out causing trouble again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost! You&rsquo;re blaming me because you&rsquo;re incompetent?" Queenie didn&rsquo;t want to waste words with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had clearly arranged everything, but in the end, Diana won again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner flipped her computer off the desk onto the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie watched her favorite computer shatter and roared, "Bastard, what are you doing? Do you know how expensive this computer is? You can&rsquo;t even afford to pay for it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is my million-dollar computer with tons of important data. You actually smashed it. Are you looking to die?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Mario and said, "Mario, get two bodyguards over here and give him a good beating."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner sneered arrogantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, everyone in the Morrison family is arrogant. You deceived me, so you should pay the price. You even sent people to attack my company, trying to take it away from me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner's angry expression startled Queenie. "What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouldn't know what she's planning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner showed the surveillance footage to Queenie. "These two sneaky people are yours, right? They claimed I was involved in selling illegal goods and wanted to report my company. Luckily, I was prepared and caught them. Otherwise, I wouldn't have realized you were using me to go after the Diana you hate most, while taking the chance to target my company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, how dare you do this to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had clearly heard that Tanner was a fool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner looked at her and said, "Are you wondering how I found out about your plan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said nothing. She had made two plans, but...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It was Diana who told me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was furious. Diana again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This didn't happen in the previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the previous life, that land belonged to Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was so angry that her head was pounding. "Do you believe whatever Diana says?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "I actually believed you and went to cause her trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I made myself very embarrassed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to get a lot of money, but not only did he fail, he also lost face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie took a deep breath, glared at him, and said, "Get lost. I don't know what you're talking about. Those two people weren't sent to your company by me. I still have work at my company and no time to argue with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "I have time. If you don't give me an explanation today, I'll expose this and say you deliberately framed Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie couldn't say a word. Her reputation was already bad, and if this matter were exposed, she would lose face in Capitole.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie asked, "What exactly do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner said, "I want you to compensate me $30 million in damages today. Otherwise, I'll make it public that you framed Diana and let everyone see your malicious heart."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "Fine! I'll have someone give you $30 million later. Now get out immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie got nothing and lost $30 million.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought Tanner could stop Diana from starting work, but she ended up losing $30 million.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tanner then left happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning around, he saw Diana and Steven. He paused slightly but said nothing and walked away briskly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was about to ask Mario to change the computer when she saw Diana and Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The humiliation of failure made her angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, what are you doing here?" Queenie said sharply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at her angry, twisted face with a smile and said pleasantly, "Of course, I'm here to watch the show."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "Diana, so what if you win? This is just a matter that can be settled with thirty million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "A mere thirty million dollars? How many thirty million dollars do you have?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana finished speaking and left with Steven, laughing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie screamed in frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't believe it; she had failed just like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario looked at her with concern and said, "Queenie, focus on handling the company's matters first. The confidential documents must not be lost."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Mario in defeat. She was truly losing everything bit by bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had a strong feeling. She wouldn't stand in the most glorious place like in her dreams, basking in everyone's attention anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mario, I'm so tired."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sat on the chair, closed her eyes, and cried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the support of the Barnes family, the Farley family, and Steven, she felt like she couldn't do anything anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario walked over, kissed her forehead, and softly said, "Queenie, don't be sad. We still have other ways. How about we withdraw the $1 billion investment overseas? What do you think?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1157.html">« Prev</a><a href="1159.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
