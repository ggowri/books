"Diana, I understand."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Grand Hotel of Capitole was the venue for tonight's banquet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil and Diana entered together.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The banquet hall was grand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many guests had already arrived, all dressed elegantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soft music filled the air, making everyone feel happy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil took Diana to a private room to meet Rita. After that, he introduced Diana to two manufacturers of high-quality fabrics.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana exchanged contact information with them. Cecil then went to find his friends.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said he had two important friends coming to meet him and would return in half an hour.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Alexander came to find Diana, so Cecil left Diana with Alexander.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's eyes were fixed on Diana's beautiful face. Tonight, she looked stunning, her skin glowing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wore a pink dress with diamonds around the collar, making her features look even more charming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you look stunning tonight," Alexander said with admiration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, feeling flattered. "Before, I was dull and plain. Now, I live for myself and want to look my best."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled brightly, her eyes sparkling under the lights.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was mesmerized. He had been sent abroad by his grandfather and had seen many beautiful women, but none compared to the girl in front of him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come, Diana, let me introduce you to my friends," he said gently.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana agreed, "Okay."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to meet important people, as they could be helpful in the future.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked up and saw Steven across the room, staring at her coldly, as if she had done something wrong.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana hesitated, not wanting to greet him in public.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned to Alexander. "Alexander, let's go."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven wanted to stop Diana, but Queenie came over. "Steven, you're here."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was also dressed elegantly, wearing a white sequined dress that showed off her perfect figure. Her makeup was light, highlighting her best features.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Queenie distracting Steven, Diana and Alexander left smoothly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven watched Diana walk away and frowned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie also noticed how beautiful Diana looked tonight. Diana was no longer hiding her beauty.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, when she was a housewife, she never bothered to dress up and wore simple clothes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Steven's attention drawn to Diana, Queenie felt a growing sense of crisis.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Jace wants to see you. I know you suddenly withdrew your investment because of Diana.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But, ever since Diana came back, I've felt insecure. Anyone would feel that way. You know I'm an orphan, and my feelings are very sensitive. I said those things because I wanted you and the others to love me more. Steven, I promise I'll change. I won't target Diana anymore."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie looked at Steven with tears in her eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, whenever she cried, Steven would comfort her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, Steven remained indifferent. "It's okay, you're the one who embarrassed yourself. Take me to see Jace."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew what Queenie had done.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie knew he was cold, but as long as he was still kind to her, she felt reassured.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She led him to see Jace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander and Diana were looking for a quiet place to chat when they heard a commotion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula shouted, "You're such a lowly woman. Last time at the banquet, you were flirting with my husband. Why are you here again today? Can't you live without men? And you're pouring wine for my husband. What's your relationship?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana and Alexander exchanged glances. She didn't want to get involved, but she recognized the woman.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wondered what Queenie's biological mother was doing there.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="327.html">« Prev</a><a href="329.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
