"Eric, what are you laughing at? Do you look down on me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric let out a bitter laugh, his eyes cold. He used to think Dylan was just reckless, but now he realized Dylan was a complete jerk. As expected, Jeff had raised them into useless fools.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We were brothers, Queenie turned us into enemies. Dylan, when you're dead, I'll still handle your funeral. Do you like crystal coffins? I'll make sure to get you one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn! Eric, do you really want me dead that badly? Let me tell you, I&rsquo;ll never give you what you want, and I sure as hell won&rsquo;t hand over the fortune to you!" Dylan was on the verge of losing it</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why does Eric keep saying I&rsquo;m going to die?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric rubbed his temples wearily. His time was precious</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>it shouldn&rsquo;t be wasted on someone who wasn&rsquo;t worth it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out. Go back to your office. If you&rsquo;ve got nothing important, don&rsquo;t come here. I don&rsquo;t want to see you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well! You think I want to see you?" Dylan scoffed coldly before heading to his office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the spacious office, he suddenly felt a rush of excitement. "Wow! Dylan, you&rsquo;re the best!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t wait to pull out his phone and call Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie answered, "Dylan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha..." Dylan laughed smugly. "Queenie, I&rsquo;ve officially joined </span><span>the</span><span> company. As for the info, I&rsquo;ll find a chance to secretly get it for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sounded surprised. "</span><span>Paula</span><span> agreed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan sat smugly on the desk, gazing at the brilliant sunlight outside. He felt like his future was bright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, she&rsquo;s my mom. How could she see me struggling out there? As long as I stir up trouble in the media, she&rsquo;s too scared of losing face. Not only did she give me a position, but she also handed me some clients."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Listening to his triumphant tone, Queenie couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that something about this was too smooth, almost unnatural.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula hadn&rsquo;t even wanted to acknowledge her three sons, why was she suddenly so indulgent with Dylan now?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She chuckled, "</span><span>Paula</span><span> </span><span>loves you more than your three brothers. You&rsquo;re her youngest, so of course, you get special treatment. Dylan, just do your job well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan sneered, "Don&rsquo;t worry! As for that bumpkin Diana, already got my friends handling her. She won&rsquo;t have it easy. She&rsquo;s </span><span>a bitch, </span><span>from the middle of nowhere. </span><span>Not deserve the fortune! Not a dime!</span><span> She&rsquo;s dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Dylan&rsquo;s venomous words, Queenie let out a cold laugh, thinking, "He really is Jeff&rsquo;s son. Dylan is just like him&mdash;selfish and ruthless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, stay safe. I&rsquo;ll be waiting for your good news. Once our company turns around, you&rsquo;ll definitely get a big share. By then, your wife and kids will surely benefit from your success."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew exactly how to control someone like Dylan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that fool Dylan, Queenie felt Paula&rsquo;s fortune was only a matter of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Blame Paula for slipping up. If she didn&rsquo;t know, maybe we could&rsquo;ve coexisted peacefully. But since she has money and refuses to share, can&rsquo;t blame me for ruthless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And, Paula schemed against me before, humiliating me. I&rsquo;ll make sure to take back everything that&rsquo;s mine&mdash;with interest!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie hung up the phone with a twisted smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she couldn&rsquo;t get what she wanted, it would tear her apart. She wanted everything Paula had, and as for her four stupid brothers? They could rot in hell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her dreams, she had everything&mdash;Paula&rsquo;s fortune, their family&rsquo;s perfect life, and her happily-ever-after with George. But why had reality turned out like this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie refused to accept it, so she knew she had to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Queenie&rsquo;s obsession and resentment had completely consumed her reason and conscience.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, it was Owen&rsquo;s turn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few hours later, Steven and Diana wrapped up the international conference.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes darkened. "George has been using your identity to approach overseas clients. If this keeps up, the loss will seriously impact the company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana frown, Steven gently brushed his fingers over her furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't worry. He won't get anything. I've got it all planned. Trust me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, I just want to find my parents. As long as they're safe, we can make our move."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the mention of this, Diana thought of Jenny. They had only been in touch during Christmas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, Jenny reached out to me during Christmas. She said she wanted to meet, but postponed it. I&rsquo;m not sure what happened."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's eyes dimmed. Jenny had never reached out to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana still held respect for Jenny, he felt a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next time she contacts you, tell me. I haven&rsquo;t seen her in ages. Ever since she was sent to the psychiatric hospital, I&rsquo;ve forbidden anyone from visiting her&mdash;just to keep her safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana recalled Jenny's voice on the phone. She seemed to be doing fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." Diana stretched lazily. "I&rsquo;m so tired. Let&rsquo;s head downstairs for lunch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt that, these days, only good food could bring her a bit of comfort after work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was hungry too. "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the two planned to head downstairs for breakfast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna had already prepared lunch for the</span><span>m</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wasn&rsquo;t surprised since Steven had always preferred quiet. As they had lunch together, they talked about work and didn&rsquo;t feel awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the first time in a long while they had a calm conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense hatred seemed to fade away with time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After lunch, Diana was nibbling on her dessert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked across at Steven, "By the way, your two friends are awful. They kept insulting me. I didn&rsquo;t bother with it, but Queenie&rsquo;s already going after Owen. I doubt he&rsquo;ll last much longer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven&rsquo;s face darkened. Owen and Yanson had been blinded by Queenie all these years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They were fooled by Queenie too. Let&rsquo;s see how their luck holds up," Steven said, knowing Owen&rsquo;s personality all too well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana could tell right away that his tone still carried traces of their old friendship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in a five-star hotel, Owen woke up from a hangover, feeling utterly drained. He glanced at the sleeping woman in his arms, her body marked with faint kiss traces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satisfied, he reached for a cigarette nearby. Picking up the lighter, he flicked it gently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a small flame appeared, he leaned down, lit the cigarette, and took a deep drag, a wave of relief washing over him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, the door was suddenly kicked open.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1061.html">« Prev</a><a href="1063.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
