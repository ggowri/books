The voice on the other end was low, but Diana recognized Althea's voice."</span><span> </span><span>Althea, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea laughed, "I'm fine. I'm on vacation on a small island. I heard you've also left the Marsh family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes slightly, "Yes, I've completely severed ties with them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's a wise choice. If we can't fight the evil, at least we can avoid them." Althea's voice carried a hint of jest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, we're both framed..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Psh</span><span>, not a big deal. Don't take it to heart. Gale is obsessed with such a bitch. We've done all we could to dissuade him from dating her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let it be. I'll have nothing to do with him anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew these were words spoken in anger. Althea loved Gale very much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even after he was abandoned, she couldn't bear to let him die.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that she was pregnant, it was best to let her focus on her pregnancy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Althea, never hesitate to ask me for help. I've severed ties with the Marsh family, but we're still good friends."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After returning to the Marsh family, she had struck a friendship with Althea.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I was more worried about you when I couldn't reach you then. Now that we're in touch, I feel relieved."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I'll call you again when I have time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay! Diana, the Marsh family are all wolves in sheep's clothing, while the Gellar family is no different. Be careful. I'm not in </span><span>Capitole</span><span>, and can't help you much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine. Don't worry about me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hung up and drove away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had done her best to change what she could from her previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who on earth tampered with Gale's car?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it have been Penelope?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she wants to live a good life, so there is no reason for her to do that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it have been Jeff's another son?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He has the strongest motive."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pondered for a moment. "I'd never met Jeff's another son in my previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff protected him quite well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And even sent him abroad to study. He was more capable than his four brothers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I used to hear that my soul was bound to Steven, thus unable to go elsewhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was only one time I didn't follow him. That day, I didn't know where Steven went. Yet when he came back, he..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stopped thinking about it and focused on driving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her grandfather and older brother had already retired to their rooms when she returned. Diana reported her safe return to her family on Line and went to bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After washing up, she lay in bed, remembering that in half a month, Paula would be sent to a mental hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had warned her already. If Paula failed to protect herself, she could do nothing to help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lost in thought, Diana heard her phone ring.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who could be calling her at this hour?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello?" Diana's voice turned soft because she was tired and sleepy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms... Ms. Bishop, it's me. Mr. Gellar's gastritis has flared up. What... What shall we do?" There came Evan's anxious voice from the other side.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="96.html">« Prev</a><a href="98.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
