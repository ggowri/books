Letting go of hate was a kind of release. The anger that had weighed on her heart for so long had finally dissolved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She truly didn't hate Paula anymore. The hate had only made her miserable, and she wanted to live a few more healthy, peaceful years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Luna came hurrying back. Seeing that Diana was unharmed, she breathed a sigh of relief and asked, "Diana, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was a little surprised. "Why are you asking me that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna frowned and explained, "While I was waiting outside, I got an alert on my phone. Someone smashed my car. I ran to the parking lot and found someone trying to steal my stuff. When they saw me coming, they ran. It was too cold to chase them, so I just called the police. I'm waiting for them to come deal with it now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana immediately understood. "It was a diversion. Someone wanted you out of the way so they could eavesdrop on my conversation with Ms. Barnes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Luna smacked her forehead, annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm such an idiot. How did I not realize that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana spoke calmly. "It was Edison. He set this up on his own turf. It's understandable you didn't catch on right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna's anger flared. "That punk! How dare he? Following someone like Queenie will get him nowhere good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had long suspected Edison of betraying Steven and aligning himself with Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She kept her composure and said, "Let it go for now. Don't tip him off. We'll use this to our advantage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna nodded, understanding. "Got it. I'll keep a close eye on that brat from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana gave a slight nod. "Good. Don't rush. The real show hasn't even started yet. This lifetime, I won't stop until I've taken down Queenie and that bastard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had never pretended to be a saint. Retribution was her creed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Silently, she hoped Queenie could make her next move sooner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wicked grin spread across Diana's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna noticed the smile out of the corner of her eye. She had been worried Diana would feel down after seeing Paula. But seeing her so cheerful, Luna felt reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she wheeled Diana off to a meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Queenie waited for Edison in an alley behind the Gellar Group's building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Edison finally arrived, the icy look in her eyes grew even colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Edison opened the car door and slid in beside Queenie, lowering his voice. "Ms. Marsh, I overheard something. Ms. Bishop isn't your father's biological daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Queenie was stunned. She felt Paula loved her father a lot, she didn't know how she could betray him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Edison looked just as shocked. He couldn't believe how messy their relationships were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the initial shock, Queenie let out a bitter laugh. "So what? She blames my dad, but she's no saint herself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Edison didn't know how to respond. He only muttered, "That's all they said. Nothing more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been nervous the entire time he was outside, almost getting caught in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In truth, Edison had always been Queenie's plant. Steven probably suspected as much, which was why he never let Edison handle any confidential files, only sending him on insignificant errands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie took a deep breath to quell the rage boiling inside her. "Fine. Go back for now. Keep a close watch on Diana. I want every last thing she has."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Edison gave her a long look and nodded. He was starting to suspect Diana might already know who he really worked for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a brief hesitation, he said nothing more, opened the door and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Edison's figure disappeared down the street, Queenie stared out at the cold, desolate world beyond the car window. Everything felt like it was spiraling out of control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She let out a mirthless laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The irony of it all was too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had always thought Paula's love for her father was real. Now she realized it was all a joke. Paula had been unfaithful too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie started to wonder how she could use this revelation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with Paula now seemingly destitute, there didn't seem to be much left to exploit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, her mother, Amelie, called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt a wave of irritation. Every time Amelie called, it was either to ask for money or to complain about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her mother's number, Queenie almost didn't want to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end, she picked up. "Mom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie's voice was frantic. "Queenie, why haven't you been answering my calls?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's tone was sharp with impatience. "Mom, just say what you want. Don't you know I've been injured?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've been in the hospital for days, and you haven't even visited me. Now you're calling to yell at me? Do you even care about how I'm doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie couldn't help but think of Paula. Whenever she got so much as a minor scratch, Paula would rush her to the hospital and find the best medicine for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to that, Amelie seemed utterly indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing her mother's voice only made Queenie compare the two women more harshly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie was practically screaming into the phone. "How could I visit you if I don't even know which hospital you're in? You wouldn't answer my calls!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Listen, I called because Paula fooled us all. She's been playing us! There's no way she's as broke as she claims.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And that company your brother lost overseas? She took it from him! Selling that company to you was just a way to cover her tracks. She's hoarded all the money for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, that money should be mine. You need to get it back from her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie's voice cracked as she spiraled into despair. This had been the worst Christmas of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was stunned. She had suspected something was off about how Noah's company had been taken, but she never imagined it had anything to do with Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long pause, the full weight of what Amelie was saying hit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't believe Paula had outmaneuvered her and even taken Noah's overseas company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The realization made her want to scream. She couldn't believe that after all her years of scheming, Paula had still outsmarted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Worse, Diana had likely been part of it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No. That's impossible! I don't believe it. Who told you this?" Queenie refused to accept that Paula could have evaded her traps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was certain her plans had been flawless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie sobbed. "Paula herself told me on Christmas Eve. And Noah's trouble at the casino? That was Jean's doing. Jean found out the truth and set him up. That little witch! How dare she? Noah is also her brother..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie was gasping for air as she wept. She was terrified of retaliation from the Foliot family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, I'm scared. Jean is a lunatic. Please help me." She begged through her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie squeezed her eyes shut, overwhelmed by pain, and quickly hung up. She couldn't figure out where everything had gone so wrong.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="981.html">« Prev</a><a href="983.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
