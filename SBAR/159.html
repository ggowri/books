After all, she is your biological sister. You two siblings can't become enemies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hmph! How can a younger sister plot against her own older brother? Diana is born vicious." Gale's face was full of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He also wanted to be nice to Diana, but Gale thought that what she did was too much, which made him discouraged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale thought, "Even for something like saving people, Diana would compete with Queenie for the credit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Queenie heard this, she had an idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie thought, "Fortunately, I plotted against Gale half a year ago and framed Althea and Diana, which is why Gale hates Diana so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had plotted against all four of her brothers and said that Diana did those things. That was why the other three brothers were unwilling to stay at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every time Queenie plotted against Diana, her four brothers would suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As time went by, Diana's four biological brothers hated Diana very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie thought, "I will also let Diana be the scapegoat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was the killer who killed her eldest brother, but Diana didn't know anything about racing. I have to find a way to get her to watch the race that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By the way, Cecil is also a racing driver, and he will bring Diana with him when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought, "These illegitimate children will disappear from this world one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, I will become the only daughter of the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I will wait for him to come back and give me the best love in the world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So what if she is my biological sister? In my heart, you're my biological younger sister." Gale rubbed Queenie's head tenderly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was very happy. "Thank you, you are the best. I will get better soon, and I will not let you worry anymore. Gale, please go and accompany Penelope when you have time, she is pregnant and needs company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale was extremely happy at the thought of becoming a father. "Okay, okay, I'll go to accompany Penelope when you're discharged from the hospital. I'm so happy to think that I'll be a father in a few months."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale liked Penelope very much because he thought that she lived a free life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope was unlike Althea who only knew how to study all day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gale thought that Althea was a nerd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was in the afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana got off work at five o'clock. She did not see Steven but saw Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was quite surprised. Alexander said he would pick her up from get off work, and he kept his word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When they were having breakfast in the morning, Alexander asked Diana to call his name directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander was several years older than her, but he didn't want her to call him Mr. Powell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana felt it was a bit awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Powell, nice to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander smiled and said, "Diana, I said I would pick you up after get off work. Are you leaving now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana asked with a smile, "You don't have any social engagements tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I am free tonight. There is a birthday party in a few days. You can go with me." Diana thought about it and realized that it would be Jace Foliot's birthday in Capitole in a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She also wanted to go because she knew Jace and her grandfather would take her with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you talking about Mr. Jace Foliot's birthday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alexander smiled and said, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, let's go together." She had already prepared the gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay! I'll come pick you up then." Alexander took her to get in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana asked Luna to go home first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana went to have dinner with Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Steven finished his work, it was already past six o'clock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He turned off the computer and checked the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did he remember that he had made an appointment with Diana to go to his house to discuss divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He frowned because he forgot the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven thought, "Will Diana be angry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven took out his cell phone and called Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana always blocked him, so he prepared several cards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A cold voice came from Diana's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, I'm coming to pick you up now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "Mr. Gellar, why don't you accompany your true love? You don't have to come to pick me up. You are not punctual, and why should I wait for you?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="158.html">« Prev</a><a href="160.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
