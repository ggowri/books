He felt complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was really wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana hated him to the extreme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They looked down on her because she was from the country, but she was a designer and a doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what could Queenie do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She acted like a spoiled child, and always slandered Diana. They should give Diana a chance to explain before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula took a deep breath, went in, and saw Gale's face full of shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said tiredly, "Gale, I have to send you away today. I can't guarantee your safety here. I am worried about the expert your father found. He won't treat you wholeheartedly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale opened his eyes suddenly. "Mom, he is my father. He will not hurt me. You have been in charge of me since I was a child. You controlled me. But my dad always gave me freedom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula looked at him in disbelief. He still did not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula roared, "Gale, why don't you understand? Jeff and Queenie have been trying to kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impossible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale couldn't believe it. Even when he heard it with his own ears, he still found it unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula said, "Gale, you hate me for controlling you all these years. You like freedom, then go find it. I have already prepared your bank card and papers. They are on the bedside table. I will not care about you anymore and will let you go free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula left after she finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was stunned and stared blankly at her leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He held his head and cried, and finally couldn't accept this fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His beloved father and sister turned out to be the ones who wanted to harm him. They also cheated him out of his shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope was pregnant, but the child was not his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the time he got injured until now, Penelope had never visited him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't understand why Jeff and Queenie treated him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Jeff was with another woman at Jace's banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They framed Diana a total of eighty-six times. Every time when it was related to Queenie, Gale would always support her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first person they wanted to get rid of was Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then Gale and Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking it through, Gale's mind suddenly became clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he felt was pain. His face turned pale and sweat appeared on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pain spread all over his body. And his legs felt burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No... It's not like that. Dad and Queenie are not that kind of people..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale lay on the bed in pain, unable to accept the fact and could only numb himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale thought of Diana's ability to perform surgery that could allow the patient to stand up within two years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly grabbed the phone and called Paula. He couldn't go abroad, and he had to stay in the country to help Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had already arrived downstairs at the hospital. When she saw that it was Gale calling, she was angry but still answered it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, what do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale said, "Mom, come back. Let's have a talk, okay?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="234.html">« Prev</a><a href="236.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
