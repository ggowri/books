Joseph is incredible. Good thing you saved him back then. He</span><span>'</span><span>s not only capable but also good-looking, hardworking, and responsible. We really hit the jackpot with him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He found out who the mole is. He said he</span><span>'</span><span>s ready. He</span><span>'</span><span>s taking the day off today, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t come to the lab. He told me to let you know if you showed up&mdash;leave the rest to him. He won</span><span>'</span><span>t let you down. Just stay out of it, let them lower their guard, and when the time comes, he</span><span>'</span><span>ll take care of all of them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana narrowed her eyes. "Who is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a traitor in her team. That was absolutely intolerable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom's face turned cold. He had been too careless, shouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have brought someone so scheming into the lab. But she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t appreciate it, and that really broke his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Diana, trust me. Let me handle this. It</span><span>'</span><span>s my fault. I brought her in because I was afraid she wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t graduate, and now she</span><span>'</span><span>s a threat. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll take care of it. You should go and prepare the medicine for Edward."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The stroke medication is all in there. You know Edward's condition, just make the adjustments."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. Since Tom had made up his mind, she would leave it to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven. "Steven, you should head back. I might be here for hours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven refused to leave. "I'll wait for you outside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saw his determination and headed straight to the medication room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven and Tom locked eyes instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom reached out to pat Steven's shoulder. Steven, who had a thing about personal space, stepped back. Tom's hand froze mid-air. He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t seem embarrassed, just pulled his hand back casually.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "Steven, you actually managed to get Diana to be nice to you. I was wondering how she dumped you before. But now, it seems like she can't get rid of you. There's one thing I don't quite get&mdash;after hurting her so badly, how do you still have the nerve to cling to her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven let out a cold laugh. "Because Diana loves me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you think you can do whatever you want just because she loves you?" Tom snapped, anger flickering in his voice. To him, Diana was incredible, and Steven didn</span><span>'</span><span>t deserve her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven narrowed his eyes dangerously. "No. I was just... caught up in things. It's an excuse, I know. But from now on, I'll treat Diana right. I won't let anyone hurt her again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom's lips curled into a cold smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 5.15pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven," he said, voice dripping with venom, "there are very few people in this world who can hurt her. And you? You're at the top of that damn list.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 5.15pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, you're special to her, alright. But lay one more finger on Diana&mdash;" His smile sharpened, all teeth and no warmth. "And I'll make sure you vanish from this world without a trace."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 5.15pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The threat hung in the air, deadly serious&mdash;and all the more chilling for how casually it was delivered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a faint smile. "You like Diana." It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t a question&mdash;it was a statement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom darted a quick, nervous glance over his shoulder. Seeing it was just the two of them, he finally said, "Yeah! Diana's beautiful and sweet. Is that so strange?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her three brothers love her even more. Steven, the only reason you were safe before was because Diana loved you. Now she doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t. We can take you out anytime we want."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don</span><span>'</span><span>t love her, but there are so many people in this world who do. So what gives you the right to waste her love for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom said that and walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stood quietly on the side. He understood what Tom meant. But being with the one he loved, even if Tom wanted to kill him, nothing could shake his determination to stay by Diana's side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven found a place to sit down and pulled out his phone to check emails from overseas. He opened his inbox, then glanced toward the pharmacy. His cold, dark eyes gradually softened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe stood outside the door, noticing Steven sitting there alone. She took in his handsome features, his confident posture. Mario didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even come close to comparing to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "If I were with him, I</span><span>'</span><span>d definitely be happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A greedy gleam sparkled in Chloe's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lately, Mario had been spoiling her more and more, buying her a multimillion-dollar house and expensive jewelry. He had given her a taste of luxury, making her believe she was worthy of Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned around and made herself a cup of coffee. Soon, she walked over, holding the coffee in her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From a distance, she gazed at Steven's handsome face, her expression shy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had read in a book that courage wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t the absence of fear, but moving forward despite it. The words encouraged people to go after what they loved without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, hi, I</span><span>'</span><span>m Chloe. How about a cup of coffee before you get back to work?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing a voice, Steven finally looked up from his emails and glanced at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the coffee in Chloe's hand, and realizing he hadn't caught what she said, it finally clicked&mdash;she was here to bring him coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe flashed a sweet smile. "Mr. Gellar, this coffee is from Ms. Bishop. She brought it back from abroad. It tastes really good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven, hearing it was from Diana, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t take it. Instead, he declined, "Sorry, I don</span><span>'</span><span>t drink coffee. My wife doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t let me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe's face instantly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now everyone knew Diana was Steven's wife. Moreover, because Diana distributed the special medicine for free to the patients, she earned a great reputation, while Mario's company suffered heavy losses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, then what kind of coffee do you like? I can make it for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven replied coldly, "No need. Only my wife can make the taste I like."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe's face turned pale. Just the mention of Diana made her angry and jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She admitted Diana was impressive, but she refused to believe Steven could resist temptation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow, so enviable. Ms. Bishop not only runs a successful business but is also the youngest professor in the medical field. I heard Professor Cullen graduated two years after Ms. Bishop."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she was praising Diana, Steven felt there was something off about her tone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a cold laugh. "Judging by your tone, you're jealous of my wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His icy tone sent a chill down Chloe's spine. The coffee cup was already hot, and Steven's words startled her so much she nearly dropped it. In her nervousness, the cup tilted suddenly, spilling scalding coffee onto the back of her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sharp scream, the cup slipped from her hand, crashing to the floor. Coffee splattered everywhere, its rich aroma quickly filling the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven stared at her coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe sobbed as she apologized, "I'm so sorry, Mr. Gellar. I'm just so useless... I can't even hold a coffee cup properly..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven cut her off coldly, "Then leave. Now!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1107.html">« Prev</a><a href="1109.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
