As long as you&#x27;re happy, that&#x27;s all that matters. Even though you didn&#x27;t win, you&#x27;re in a good mood.&quot;</p><p>All night, her laughter had filled the room, even though she lost a lot of money to them.</p><p>Diana asked, &quot;Nolan, do you think I&#x27;m really happy? Why can&#x27;t I ever win? Olivia said I don&#x27;t bet my life, just my luck.&quot;</p><p>The other four were speechless.</p><p>That was blatant bragging.</p><p>Nolan laughed, &quot;Diana, you&#x27;ve said all that, but isn&#x27;t the last part really what you wanted to say?&quot;</p><p>Under the lights, Nolan&#x27;s features were sharp, his demeanor elegant. After years of working in the business world, he maintained his pure smile.</p><p>Diana suddenly realized that Nolan had grown up. He was now a capable man.</p><p>She wasn&#x27;t bragging. &quot;Nolan, Nick, Barry, we&#x27;ve known each other since we were little. We&#x27;ve watched each other grow. It never felt like much before, but this year, it hit me that we&#x27;ve all grown up.</p><p>&quot;Back then, each of you had grand ambitions. Nolan, you always wanted to be a CEO, and now your dreams come true.</p><p>&quot;Nick, you always wanted to be a police officer. What happened?&quot;</p><p>Diana then turned to Barry. &quot;Barry, you used to dream of being a designer. After I left, you all should have gone abroad to study. But instead, you stayed behind to protect me. I&#x27;ve told you so many times—just go chase your dreams. Why didn&#x27;t you go abroad?&quot;</p><p>Nick smiled, &quot;Ms. Bishop, I wanted to be a police officer, to protect people. My dream has already come true. Besides being a cop, I&#x27;m your bodyguard.&quot;</p><p>Barry gave a wry smile. &quot;Ms. Bishop, you&#x27;ve been so focused on Steven these past three years that you didn&#x27;t see our efforts. We&#x27;ve all fulfilled our dreams. Now that you need us, we&#x27;ve come back to your side.&quot;</p><p>Diana was both surprised and relieved. She patted her chest with a smile. &quot;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t delay your dreams. Now that I know you&#x27;ve all made them come true, I can sleep well tonight. Good night, everyone.&quot;</p><p>She smiled and stood up. Luna asked, &quot;Diana, aren&#x27;t you going to stay up with us?&quot;</p><p>Diana chuckled, &quot;Luna, my memory&#x27;s terrible. I almost forgot. I&#x27;ve been playing poker just to keep myself awake, so let&#x27;s stay up together. Let&#x27;s go outside and set off fireworks.&quot;</p><p>She stood up, her eyes a little misty.</p><p>But she still smiled brightly, her teeth shining and her smile dazzling.</p><p>The four people opposite her felt their eyes tear up.</p><p>They understood. The reason Diana kept playing poker with them was because she wanted to know their plans.</p><p>If they hadn&#x27;t worked toward their dreams over the years, she would have felt guilty.</p><p>Even though they were orphans, entrusted to the Azure Group, Diana still wanted them to have their own lives.</p><p>Nolan and Nick went to get the fireworks.</p><p>Luna brought Diana her coat and helped her put it on. She hobbled outside.</p><p>Looking at the icy world outside, winter had blanketed everything in snow and cold.</p><p>As they looked at the endless fireworks in the distance, the dazzling lights lit up the entire sky.</p><p>Diana smiled, her joy evident.</p><p>Finally, she was having the Christmas she&#x27;d always wanted.</p><p>Leopold and her brothers weren&#x27;t there with her, but she was still very happy.</p><p>Nolan and Nick set up the firecracker display. Once it was ready, Luna exclaimed, &quot;Hurry, there are only 30 seconds left. Light it.&quot;</p><p>Nolan took out a lighter and lit the fireworks.</p><p>The fireworks shot up into the sky.</p><p>It was deafening.</p><p>The sky was lit up as the fireworks shot up, instantly brightening the surroundings.</p><p>Each firework was like a brilliant star, blooming with dazzling colors in the night sky.</p><p>Diana tilted her head back and smiled happily.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s so beautiful,&quot; she said.</p><p>Nolan stood a little further away, pulling out his phone to take a picture of her bright smile.</p><p>It had been so long since he&#x27;d seen her smile this joyfully.</p><p>&quot;Ah, so beautiful,&quot; Luna exclaimed. &quot;To the distant loved ones. Happy Christmas!&quot;</p><p>Diana caught the keywords.</p><p>Loved ones.</p><p>She wondered if Luna was talking about Evan.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Diana thought of Steven and smiled again, &quot;Steven, in this life, happy Christmas to you too.&quot;</p><p>After lighting the fireworks, Diana told the others to go back inside. She handed out the gifts she had prepared earlier.</p><p>She looked at the four of them and smiled, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to play favorites this year. Each of you gets a check for 1.88 million dollars. After the bank opens, you can go cash it.&quot;</p><p>Nolan was over the moon. Diana had just added ten million dollars to his salary, and now he was getting 1.88 million dollars as a gift. This year had been amazing.</p><p>Nick and Barry were equally happy.</p><p>Diana looked at Luna. &quot;Iris and Aiden are about to return from studying abroad. You can give them the same amount. You take care of it.&quot;</p><p>Luna nodded happily. &quot;Got it, Diana. I&#x27;ll give it to them later.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m so happy. Let&#x27;s go to rest,&quot; Diana said, cheerfully heading upstairs.</p><p>The others watched her, filled with gratitude.</p><p>*****</p><p>In an apartment somewhere, Evan looked at Steven, who sat still in his wheelchair, staring deeply at Diana. Tonight, she was genuinely happy.</p><p>But he wasn&#x27;t.</p><p>Evan grumbled, &quot;Mr. Gellar, I risked my life for you. You&#x27;re not going to show any appreciation this Christmas?&quot;</p><p>Steven finally turned to look at him. &quot;I&#x27;ve prepared a check for you for ten million dollars. You&#x27;ve worked hard. When you get married, I&#x27;ll give you more.&quot;</p><p>Evan was shocked.</p><p>He thought he had heard it wrong.</p><p>Just a moment ago, he had envied Luna and the others. Now, he only envied himself.</p><p>He grinned widely. Ever since Steven had learned the truth about Queenie, he had become so much easier to get along with.</p><p>This was how it should be.</p><p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Gellar,&quot; Evan said excitedly. This was the reward for his hard work.</p><p>He looked at Steven, who remained still. Diana had already gone back to her room. There were no cameras in her room, but Steven still couldn&#x27;t seem to pull his eyes away. Evan asked, &quot;By the way, what gift did you get Mrs. Gellar this year?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="966.html">« Prev</a><a href="968.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
