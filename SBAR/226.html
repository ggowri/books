After a moment's hesitation, she said, "Gale, after you had the car accident, we suspected that someone had tampered with your car. We have called the police, and they have contacted Diana. They are investigating her downstairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He bit his lip. Could it really be Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had advised him not to come to the race.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, he didn't believe her words at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jeff took out a share transfer agreement and said earnestly, "Gale, you will be sent abroad for treatment in three days. I will handle everything for you. You have 5% of the shares. Give it to me, okay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The company has been in a lot of turmoil recently. I'm also worried that something might happen to the company. Your treatment can't be delayed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paula is too busy with company matters to visit you now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly thought of Paula's words, no, the recording that she had asked him to listen to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people who really planned to kill him were Jeff and Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula also said that she would divorce, but she didn't want him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was extremely shocked. When he saw the share transfer agreement, his heart sank to the bottom. Could it be that what she had said was true?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still remembered Diana saying that Harry didn't expose him because he wanted to see him receive the fatal blow from the people he loved most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be that her statement was true?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale was afraid that Queenie, whom he had spoiled since childhood, was really the killer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his rage, he stared at Jeff. "Dad, I just got injured. I speak with difficulty and can't even lift my hands. However, you asked me to transfer the shares to you. Are you so impatient?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff tried to be patient. The most important thing now was to get Gale to sign the share transfer agreement and complete his plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't been feeling well these past few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, it's okay that you don't give it to me. What about Queenie? You love her so much. You can rest assured if she keeps the shares."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale roared angrily, "Get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He held 5% shares, which Paula had previously asked him for.&#8203;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he declined, thinking that she deceived him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mind was in a whirl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who was telling the truth, and who was lying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They called the police. Was Diana also at the scene today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Was Diana there today?" Gale looked pallid, and his voice was very weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pain in his legs was unbearable for him, and he felt dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze at Queenie was particularly sharp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you two are here for the shares."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale fixed his eyes on them with a half smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie and Jeff frowned, wondering if he saw through something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You said that Diana plotted against me. Do you have any evidence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale's voice was low and hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie said, "Gale, she must hold a grudge against you and decide to harm you because you secretly took photos of her design drawings and sent them to Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After you got into the accident, I saw a suspicious person appear around your car through the surveillance video. He was arrested, and he confessed that Diana ordered him. Dad was so angry that he called the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, she is your biological sister. You will be very sad if you know that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But your top priority now is to cure your legs. Diana should be punished by law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale closed his eyes and asked painfully, "Where is my phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie walked over. As he was unwilling to sign, she came up with an evil idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, you should have a good rest now. I will let Dad keep your phone for you and return it to you after you sign the share transfer agreement."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gale suddenly opened his eyes in shock. "Queenie, what do you mean? Are you threatening me?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="225.html">« Prev</a><a href="227.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
