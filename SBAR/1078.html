Maybe there will be news soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said unexpectedly, "Keep investigating. I need to develop a special drug, and I require massive funding. I won't be back for a while, and you should avoid going out as much as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven nervously grabbed her hand and said, "No, Diana! Your grandpa just sent a message telling you not to go out. It's too dangerous outside right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana firmly shook her head and said, "Steven, I've been exposed to this virus, so I must develop the special drug. The only thing you need to do now is stay here and keep investigating Andrew's case."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have to go. I'll keep you updated on my safety."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven went to the kitchen and handed her a sandwich. "No matter how busy you are, you need to eat. You'll need energy to work."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and responded to his concern. "Alright, just wait for my updates at home. Remember to take your medicine on time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching her leave in a hurry, without much time to say anything more, Steven's eyes were filled with worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana dialed Tobias's phone as she walked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana!" Tobias's anxious voice came through. "Where are you? Don't go out today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tobias, I was just about to call you. Take Grandpa abroad quickly, the situation is serious. He's too old. Don't worry about me, I can take care of myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias said firmly, "No way. We can't leave you behind!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tobias, I'm a doctor, and I must go to the lab now. You should take Grandpa, Julius, and Olivia away immediately. Contact me once you're abroad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias continued, "Diana..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't say anything more, I'll be fine. I have to rush to the hospital now. You all leave quickly!" Diana said and decisively hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting in the car, Diana quickly finished her sandwich and drove out of the garage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he took a mask from the glove compartment, put it on, and drove off swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, she got out of the car and went straight to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The emergency room corridor was crowded with patients, with coughing and heart-wrenching cries intertwining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana swallowed a pill and quickly moved through the crowd, her hem gently lifting with the breeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Doctor, hurry! Bed three's oxygen level dropped to 90% again!" the nurse cried out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the crowded ward, Diana's eyes grew more worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she turned and rushed to the lab.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the lab, Tom was discussing the flu outside with his colleagues.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana arrive, Tom asked helplessly, "Silly girl, didn't I tell you to stay home? Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pulled down her mask and said urgently, "Tom, I don't have time to explain. You must develop the cure quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom, fully aware of her abilities, immediately said to Chloe and the others, "Everyone, keep it up. We must develop the cure as soon as possible. Time is tight, and we should be prepared with protection and contingency plans."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone responded enthusiastically, "Got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom sent a colleague skilled in cooking to purchase supplies, while he and Diana entered the special research lab.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Chloe was still sending a message: [Darling, I'm about to start work. We need to develop the cure at the company. Please don't get infected.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario: [Alright, thank you, Chloe. Stay safe and keep in touch. Love you.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the words "love you," Chloe's eyes filled with tenderness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario: [Chloe, can you let me know as soon as the cure is developed?]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe&#65306;&#12304;&#24403;&#28982;&#12290;&#25105;&#20250;&#31532;&#19968;&#20010;&#36890;&#30693;&#20320;&#12290;&#23545;&#20102;&#65292;&#20146;&#29233;&#30340;&#65292;Ms. Bishop&#20063;&#26469;&#20102;&#12290;Professor Cullen&#35828;&#22905;&#21307;&#26415;&#36229;&#32676;&#65292;&#25105;&#20204;&#32943;&#23450;&#33021;&#24456;&#24555;&#25104;&#21151;&#12290;&#12305;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario: [Baby, are you talking about Diana? She's currently the richest woman in Capitole. I heard she has a bad reputation, so be careful not to let her take credit for your work.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe frowned slightly when she saw the message. Thinking of how highly Tom regarded Diana, jealousy welled up in her.  </span><br><span>Chloe: [You're right. I need to get back to work. I'll let you know as soon as I have any news.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe happily put her phone back in her bag and went to work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Queenie's office, she looked very indifferent, and George's face was grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario looked at the two and said, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Marsh, I just confirmed that Diana went to Tom's lab. She's working on developing a special medicine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie frowned and sneered, "Is her medical skill really that good?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's gaze was grim. "Indeed. My father found out that Diana was Professor Helena Kerr's last student. Before she passed away, she taught Diana all her lifelong knowledge of traditional medicine, so Diana is highly skilled. I just received this news from my dad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of complex emotion flashed in Queenie's eyes, and she felt a faint sense of unwillingness in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the years, she had put in countless efforts. Not only had she achieved extraordinary skill in piano performance, but she was also proficient in economic management and investment, gaining significant success in the business world with her sharp insight and calm judgment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was indeed outstanding, but at this moment, an indescribable jealousy welled up in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana&#26356;&#20248;&#31168;&#65292;&#22905;&#25317;&#26377;&#20248;&#31168;&#30340;&#23398;&#21382;&#21644;&#31934;&#28251;&#30340;&#21307;&#26415;&#65292;&#32780;&#19988;&#36824;&#26159;Helena&#25945;&#20250;&#20102;&#22905;&#24456;&#22810;&#12290;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's face darkened, and her eyes were filled with discontent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "What's going on with this flu?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared straight at George across from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George gently stroked her hair and comforted, "Don't worry about the reason behind it. It's in our favor. My company is also developing a special medicine, and it will make me a lot of money, so Diana must not beat me to it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie instantly realized that George wanted to monopolize the huge profits this time. What was even more terrifying was that this might be Andrew's scheme, sacrificing countless lives to achieve his goal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gave George a cold smile, a trace of shadow flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said nothing and turned to leave the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next meeting room, Queenie sent a message to Sandra, telling her to get ready because she still had an ace up her sleeve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since George wanted to monopolize the profits, she had other ways.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the flu virus worsened, Diana's team developed a miracle drug at an astonishing speed within three days and nights.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as she was about to announce it, the Stella Pharmaceutical Company suddenly declared the successful development of a similar drug.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The exhausted Diana had yet to realize that in these three days, the number of infections had already exceeded over a million, with countless casualties.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Chloe had leaked the miracle drug's secret to Mario, who then handed it over to Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's team, prepared by Sandra, came into play at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Diana follow the news for three days and nights, already exhausted, Tom said, "Diana, you haven't slept for three days. Go rest, leave the rest to me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1077.html">« Prev</a><a href="1079.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
