"He couldn't recognize Queenie? Or is he pretending? The drug hasn't kicked in yet, but could Jeff's memory be deteriorating? I need to be careful," she pondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula looked at Jeff with concern. "When your dad fainted, he hit his head on the coffee table. There might be something wrong with his brain. Let's get the doctor to give him a thorough check-up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anxious, Queenie said, "Mom, we need to take Dad for a check-up now. He doesn't even know who I am."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula nodded. "Alright. Your grandparents heard about your father's illness and rushed here. You go home and attend to them. I'll arrange for someone to look after your father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was taken aback by the presence of her grandparents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had been materialistic and constantly critical. If it weren't for their animosity towards Paula, Queenie wouldn't have acknowledged them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I can't take care of them," Queenie expressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had been frustrated recently. She had been dealing with issues in Felicity's project. Despite closing the deal, production of the product was delayed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, she would be joining the crew in a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula weighed the situation. "What do we do? If nobody tends to your grandparents, they'll surely be angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie reassured her, "There's a nanny at home. Don't worry. Focus on Dad for now. I'll head back." With that, she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was getting late, but Steven still hadn't called her. Feeling that he was becoming increasingly indifferent towards her, she felt the need to hold on to him even tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Queenie depart, Paula shook her head in realization. How hadn't she seen through Queenie's tricks earlier?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, people's true colors remain obscured throughout a lifetime. Despite over 20 years with Jeff, Paula struggled to grasp her nature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula asked Jeff to lie down, and Jeff did obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's eyes flashed with resentment as she said, "Jeff, you didn't give your parents living expenses last month, and now they've come. Get well soon. Weren't you always a dutiful son? If you keep like this, I may have to sell your company to support them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Jeff said abruptly, sitting up with a look of unease on his face. The company appeared unprofitable to the others, but it was because he had given all the money to his illegitimate son and his mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff suspected that Paula was plotting against him, wondering if she knew something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was aware that he was pretending and also noticed that Jeff was suspicious of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula provoked, "Jeff, you are truly shameless. You couldn't recognize your daughter, yet you still care about your company. Are you really sick or faking it? Now that you are fine, go back to take care of your parents. I have taken care of them for more than 20 years, and I'm tired. At my age, I have to be ordered around by your mother every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are my husband. If you care about me, you shouldn't let your mother boss me around like that. The company is declining. If the poor management continues, I don't know what to do. And your four sons couldn't help anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since marrying you, I've helped run your company, but it's still struggling. I've put in so much effort for this family, but has anyone appreciated it? Your mother even blames me for tearing this family apart. But without me, would you have enjoyed the life you have now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm exhausted. I can't handle it anymore. You go back and look after them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Paula left angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching her leave, Jeff pondering her words and acknowledging their truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had been very hard for her to run the company alone over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But wasn't it her duty to take care of his parents?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff looked down at his lower body with a heavy heart. The doctor said that he had taken too many medicines and he might be unable to perform sexually. What should he do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what happened just now? He really couldn't recognize Queenie for a moment. Was he really sick?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, he had a poor memory and often suffered from hallucinations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff slapped his face hard, feeling the pain as he realized he wasn't dreaming. So why was he having hallucinations?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="274.html">« Prev</a><a href="276.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
