Perhaps because of the bond of blood ties, her heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on Paula that being misunderstood was so painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I am not here to ask for money. Because of your warning, I was able to divorce in time and save the Barnes family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here today to thank you for telling me everything that Jeff, the liar, had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I was wrong in the past. The lies blinded me, and I spoiled the mistress' daughter. I am also very grateful to you for rescuing Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything that happened before was my fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula's sincere apology upset Diana. Knowing that she had a mother, she really longed for her love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what she got was the most cruel humiliation and all kinds of contempt from Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The past was in the past. Diana said, "I won't accept your apology, and I will never regard you as my mother again. We are not destined to be mother and daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words were heartless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was depressed, though aware that she would not forgive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I was wrong. I was really wrong. I realize what I did and what I said to you is unforgivable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, I know I was wrong. Diana, I have severed ties with Queenie. From now on, you are my only daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was amused by Paula's reply. She repeated what Paula had said before with a smile. "If my memory serves, you claimed that Queenie was your only daughter and that you didn't have a daughter like me who would only bring shame to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Learning that I was brought back from the countryside, you were not even willing to make it public that I was your biological daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were afraid that I would embarrass you, weren't you? You gave birth to me, but how did you treat me after I was back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All my clothes were what Queenie didn't want. You ordered a dress worth one million dollars for her, but you refused to buy me a dress worth one thousand dollars. You even said that I was only fit to wear cheap clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do I need a mother like you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You gave birth to me. I will remember this favor. When you are sixty years old, I will give you the alimony that the court requires."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the last thing Diana could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I told you the truth because you are my biological mother. I've repaid you, and I won't owe you anything from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sat there with a cold face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, her heart broke, even though she didn't care about Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula wept bitterly. She had anticipated this. According to her understanding of Diana's temper, she would not forgive any of them after deciding to leave that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was actually very outstanding. She didn't make it clear because she didn't want to compete with Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paula was too foolish to discover it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She witnessed several conspiracies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Queenie who provoked Diana, causing Diana to beat her in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they all spoke for Queenie at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Queenie was brought up with great care by Paula. Feeling sorry for Queenie because she could not find her biological parents, Paula treated Diana that way.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all her fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was afraid of losing face when Diana came back. In order to gain a good reputation, she announced that Diana was her adopted daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mother, she was quite ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stood up and said, "Diana, I know I was wrong. Can you please..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="611.html">« Prev</a><a href="613.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
