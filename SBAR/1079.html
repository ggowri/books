She hadn't slept for three days, her body weak and unsteady. She needed to rest immediately, or she wouldn't be able to face what was coming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tom, I submitted the patent application for the miracle drug yesterday, and during this special period, the relevant department has already opened a green channel. Haven't the procedures from other departments been approved yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I saw someone selling the miracle drug on the market, and it's selling well. Send someone to buy one; I need to analyze its composition."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought of Andrew and the box he was carrying, and the unease in her heart rose again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What she feared most was that Andrew might be pulling the strings behind all this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom was equally exhausted, but when he looked at Diana in front of him, his eyes were full of admiration. He knew she worked hard, but he hadn't expected her to be this dedicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Diana, I'll arrange for someone to buy it. The most important thing for you now is to rest. Whatever happens, we'll talk after you wake up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, seeing the rising death toll, Diana couldn't wait any longer. "Tom, I know you're tired too, but could you push the relevant departments again? Ask them to speed up the approval process."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't finished speaking when Chloe rushed in hurriedly. "Ms. Bishop! Professor Cullen! Something's wrong! Someone reported our lab for conducting illegal experiments, and they suspect the virus originated here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Tom was stunned. Then, he smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We haven't slept for three days and nights to develop the cure, and we barely had time to eat. I'm still starving, yet you're turning against us? How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are they blind? The lab has all the necessary records, so how could we possibly conduct illegal experiments?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom felt both shocked and angry. He wanted to see which foolish person was stirring up trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Do they only think with their asses?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana calmly stared at Chloe and asked, "Where are the law enforcement officers?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe anxiously pointed outside the lab and said, "Ms. Bishop, they're right outside, and they've brought a lot of people in to search. One of them said we're hiding a virus here, so they want to investigate the person in charge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom, the head of the lab, looked at Diana with a serious expression and said, "Diana, stay here and don't go out. I'll handle them. I'm the person in charge, and I'll leave with them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave her a look. One of them had to stay outside to deal with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tom wasn't good at this kind of thing; he was only skilled in medicine and silence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana was good at investigation, so she subtly nodded in understanding, signaling him to be careful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the lab was sealed off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and the others were driven out, and their files were left behind for further investigation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was already exhausted, and the investigators questioned her for a long time before leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe looked at her, her tone full of resentment. "Ms. Bishop, I just heard a rumor that you were involved in the research, so everyone suspects you brought the virus, and that's why the lab was sealed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, what on earth is going on? Our entire team worked so hard to develop the special medicine, which should have been our greatest honor. However, if we're accused of poisoning, all our efforts over the past three days will be in vain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Chloe's words, the expressions of three out of the other six team members instantly turned displeased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Technician Joseph responded coldly, "Chloe, if you don't know what to say, just shut up! They're clearly framing us. As a team member, is it appropriate for you to say something like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe bit her lip, a trace of complexity flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at her without responding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the lab was sealed, someone must know she was in the lab, so they were reported.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said to the others, "You can go back and rest for now. We'll inform you if there's any news."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe, unwilling to let Diana take all the credit, sneered, "Ms. Bishop, you rise to fame alone, but when Professor Cullen has to face the difficulties for you, you choose to go home and rest. How does that make sense? Ms. Bishop, you'd better solve the problem before leaving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, are you hiding something from us?" she asked aggressively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph stepped in front of Diana, his gaze cold. "Chloe, you're the laziest in our team. All you do every day is play on your phone and daydream, so what right do you have to criticize us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned, her irritation growing stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Joseph, let them leave first. Come with me, I have something to tell you," she said, her voice filled with exhaustion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joseph looked at Diana, then at Chloe. Remembering her idleness all day, he felt even more displeased inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at Chloe and said, "Chloe, the enforcement department never mentioned the lab hiding a virus, and it was you who told me this. Are you sure they told you directly, or is it just hearsay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's tone was extremely cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe stared straight at her and said, "Ms. Bishop, I know you're impressive, but I'm saying this because I have evidence. Right now, the entire internet is buzzing about Hugo Hospital's lab being involved in illegal experiments, possibly even the virus's origin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sneered, "If this is the virus's origin, why are you still alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chloe was very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the others and said, "Aren't you all fine too? Our achievements are the result of teamwork, and everything I do is for the team and for the patients suffering from illness. If you only care about profits and don't want to follow Tom, you can leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The team leader isn't me; it's Tom. Success or failure, this is the result of his leadership. I won't take credit from anyone; I'm just fulfilling my duties."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I can clearly tell you that the lab was funded by me, and I would never engage in any illegal activities!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Diana turned and left with Joseph.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching their backs, Chloe, still unwilling to give up, continued to stir things up, saying, "Chris, you all saw that, right? The moment something happens, Ms. Bishop shows this kind of attitude. She just tells us to go home and wait. How long are we supposed to wait?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chris Carter had long been dissatisfied with Chloe's behavior, so at this moment, he looked at her coldly and said, "At a time like this, you're still thinking about taking credit. What contribution have you made? Yet you still want to claim credit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What does the cure have to do with you? We're just sharing a lab with Ms. Bishop and Professor Cullen, but they're the ones who actually developed the cure. What are you making a fuss about?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1078.html">« Prev</a><a href="1080.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
