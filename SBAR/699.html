Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Diana had no idea of the affair between her and Levi.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold wind howled outside the window, and Queenie's heart was even colder than the freezing world out there.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand why things had gone so badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Queenie's phone rang. Upon seeing that it was Levi, she quickly answered the call and asked, "Levi, how could such news appear on the Internet? Didn't you say you would take all the necessary precautions? Why were we still photographed? Are you trying to ruin me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie roared angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi had originally thought that Queenie was quite attractive and wanted to have some fun with her, but he never expected it would end up harming him. He couldn't understand how she could get pregnant from just that one time they didn't use a condom.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi also became increasingly angry as he thought more about how Queenie's pregnancy had become public knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Queenie, didn't I tell you? I asked you not to worry and that I would let you know as soon as I came up with a solution. But why did you make it known to everyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Queenie became even angrier, as she had not been the one to expose the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I be supposed to know? No one else knew about this except you. If it wasn't you, then who else could it be?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Levi, Queenie even more did not want the world to know about her pregnancy. If Steven found out she was pregnant, things would become even harder to handle in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she forgot that she had just told Diana about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana would not keep silent like she used to.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, do you think I'm an idiot?" he shouted back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie also knew that Levi would not jeopardize his own future.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But besides him, she couldn't figure out who else could know about her pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie knew, but she wouldn't betray her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was very puzzled, her face twisted. "Who exposed our situation, and what should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Queenie recalled. "Levi, it's Diana. She knows I'm pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi said in an icy voice, "Did you tell her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to plot against her. You said before that you would help me deal with Diana. Now is the best time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew that the best approach was not to place hope in anyone or anything. Being independent and becoming stronger herself was the right path.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was not strong enough to rely on herself now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, are you crazy? You and she have always been enemies, yet you voluntarily revealed your weakness to her. Have you lost your mind?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was very upset now, but she didn't know if Diana was the one who exposed this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she wanted Diana dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi was also her knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Levi, we've been schemed by Diana. What should we do? I don't want to ruin your reputation," Queenie said in a gentle yet worried voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Levi's personality. Gentle and delicate women could always attract his affection, which was why she could grab his heart at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi was silent for a while before saying, "It's unrealistic to target Diana now. Queenie, have you become stupid after getting pregnant? Your mother's previous scandal was known to everyone, and she framed Diana for killing Mrs. Foliot. I didn't expect you to be so stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Mrs. Foliot's accident, your mother and Mark are the biggest suspects.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only solution is to clarify that you're not pregnant, Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered as she knew that Levi was trying to evade his responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was icy, carrying a bone-chilling coldness as she was reduced to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said in a deep voice, "Levi, I know you don't want to be responsible for my pregnancy."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="698.html">« Prev</a><a href="700.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
