He could only live a more wonderful life when he became the head of the family. Besides, he had the ability. He said, "Okay, Dad. I agree, but you can't interfere in the company's affairs in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your illegitimate child, I will send him to study abroad. When he returns, I will give him some start-up funds. If he is capable, he can make a name for himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel didn't push them too hard. He wanted to live an easier life in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He showed mercy to have a way out if he was forced into despair one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave him a way to survive, so he must live well in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt agreed, and everything was settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Cecil left the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They let Samuel handle the company's affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they got downstairs, Diana looked at the snow in the sky and reminded Cecil, </span><span>"Cecil, Queenie has changed. You gotta be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil smiled brightly at her and said crisply, "Diana, I will watch out. Don't worry about me. Take good care of yourself. Didn't you say you would take me abroad to do business after the New Year?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm looking forward to that. Let's expand and strengthen the company together. It will overwhelm Queenie like a huge mountain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded with a smile. "Yeah. Let's go there after the New Year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was delighted. The projects recommended by Diana had always been very profitable. "Okay. I'll drive you home. There is a banquet tonight. It'll start in the afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head and refused him. "No, thank you. Go back to your work. Tomorrow is New Year. Let's have a good time. After New Year, there will be a good show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil understood. He smiled and said calmly, "Diana, I got it. Queenie was wrong and did a lot of illegal things. The trap after the New Year could bring her down at any time. Even if she could dream about the things in her previous life, it'd be too late for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded calmly. "Yes. No matter what she does, it'll be too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled with a cold light in her eyes, asking Luna to take her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man beside her must pay with his life for her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil watched her leave with a gentle smile on his sexy lips. "Diana, you gotta get better soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana heard him and looked back with a smile. "Don't worry. I'll get better soon. Cecil, I wish you a happy new year in advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil said, "Diana, Happy New Year! I'll come to you after the New Year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna helped Diana into the car and then into the driver's seat, driving away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil watched them leave for a long time. After he made sure that there was no car following Diana, he got into the car and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George did not leave, watching Diana and Cecil leave. Queenie leaned back in her seat in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes. Everything shouldn't be like this. How did she pull through these past ten years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one but she knew how much effort she put into improving herself. She didn't want her effort to be wasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie never admitted defeat, but she lost to Diana several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's company should be hers, but something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, Cecil and Diana have known our plan. The project after the New Year must be started as soon as possible. Our funding chain cannot be broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This project must be completed within two years after it is launched so that the funds can be recovered as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They failed with Steven. If they had everything from Steven, they wouldn't have such a hard time now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had planned and made an effort for over ten years, but they failed to get anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie understood. She nodded and said, "I've arranged it. George, don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was slightly hoarse. She was also very angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George was angry and glared at Queenie. "Diana seems to have bewitched Samuel. He didn't kill her and instead sides with her now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and the more disappointed he got.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a pity. A sure thing just slipped through his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't say anything. Samuel wanted to live a good life. No one wanted to go to jail at such a young age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana saw through Samuel and convinced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said irritably, "George, let's go back. Tomorrow is the New Year. Let's sort things out after the holiday. We'll have a stunning comeback victory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George said, "Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie closed her eyes. Her cell phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Queenie picked it up and saw it was Felicity calling, her heart skipped a beat. She had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity said, "Ms. Marsh, something bad happened. Our company was reported to have illegally acquired the Foliot Group, and the Law Enforcement Department has come to the company and showed us the evidence. Please save me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie was shocked. Who turned them in again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity said, "Ms. Marsh, you know how we got the Foliot Group. We did play some tricks under the table. I didn't expect to be discovered. Didn't you say the evidence had been destroyed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had just arranged everything for the company when the Law Enforcement Department arrived. If this cannot be resolved, the branch will be closed down." Felicity was very worried. She founded the company and was reluctant to see it collapse like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie closed her eyes, her long eyelashes fluttering. Now that the Law Enforcement Officers had come with evidence, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity was finished, but there was still room for turnaround.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity was her most competent subordinate. Losing her would be a big blow to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. Let them investigate first. We can pass the buck to Jace's nephews. When I signed the contract with them, I played a trick. You will be fine, but the company will suffer heavy losses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Felicity was saved, the company's losses could be recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's words brought great confidence to Felicity, who instantly had an idea. "Ms. Marsh, I know what to do. Don't worry. I'll handle it and minimize the company's losses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie said, "Good. Felicity, you are the person I trust the most. I will increase your annual salary to three million dollars. Thanks for taking the trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity was very happy. "Thank you, Ms. Marsh. I gotta take care of the company's </span><span>affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were tears in her eyes, but she closed her eyes and forced the tears back, swearing she would make Diana's life a living hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This must have something to do with Diana and Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George noticed her depression and asked softly, "Queenie, what happened to the company again?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="942.html">« Prev</a><a href="944.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
