" Queenie smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mm." Steven ignored her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Owen sent him another video, in which Diana was dancing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had changed into a black dress, with the neckline slightly loose. Her body proportions were excellent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A bonfire was lit under the coconut trees on the beach and she was performing the Latin dance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The movements of her style were beautiful and powerful. Each step she took was breathtaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared intently at her graceful figure. How tempting and alluring!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man sitting across from her was the one who dined with her last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those smiling eyes on his handsome face were gentle, reflecting Diana's spectacular dance moves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had never seen her being this passionate before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She utilized her body to the fullest extent, entrancing and charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was stunned. He didn't expect Diana, who always did things properly, to dance this well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was offended seeing him staring at his phone in silence, but her tone was still gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing her voice, Steven turned off his phone and asked directly, "You called Diana today, claiming I wanted to divorce her, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie was taken aback. Seems that tonight didn't have a good start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How did he know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie shook her head. "I didn't. Diana is lying. I asked her to come back for dinner, saying you would be here. She not only refused but even scolded me. How dare I interfere in your marriage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie, sitting across him, seemed very aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stared at her sad expression, his gaze increasingly sharp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula took the opportunity to sit down and interrupted, "Steven, you promised to marry Queenie back then. A man of honor should always keep his word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You don't love Diana anyway. Divorce her and marry Queenie. Diana has signed the divorce agreement. There won't be any property dispute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Come to think of it, in the past two years, you haven't even spent a penny on her, let alone bought her a single gift. It's as if you wanted to have no attachments when divorcing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You bought an island worth hundreds of millions just to make Queenie happy, but felt reluctant to buy a wedding ring for Diana. Obviously, you're madly in love with Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the contrary, Diana took good care of you when you were at your lowest. Given all that she did for you, please let her go. Marry Queenie instead. You'll be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I watched you grow up and know well your feelings for Queenie. You're a good match for her. We'd be at ease with you by her side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula tried to ingratiate him. To make sure her evil plan would succeed, it was unwise to push him too hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This ungrateful guy didn't deserve Diana at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her words do make sense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven clenched his fists. Not until now did he realize how deeply he had hurt Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He met Queenie's every unreasonable request, but felt reluctant to support Diana's basic life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Paula hadn't mentioned it, he would have forgotten about it entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie stared at Steven with utmost expectation, waiting for him to agree to marry her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven remained silent. The atmosphere instantly became nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Intimidated by Steven's cold demeanor, Jeff was too frightened to utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven seemed a bit off tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, you've promised to marry me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie handed a USB drive to Steven, "Don't you always want to know how your mother went crazy? The culprit is Diana. Here is what I've found out. You'll know the truth after reading the documents.
