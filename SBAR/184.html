All this time, he had thought that the doctor had cured him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana gave all the credit to Helen and the doctor, saying that Helen was the one who had found him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It turned out that it was Diana who had healed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The process had been perilous and filled with danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He kept his gaze fixed on the car ahead. "Diana, you risked your life loving me, but I never realized it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No, he had felt it. Her careful care for over a year. But he hadn't cherished it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everything changed when Queenie came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had tried to explain at first, but he didn't believe her, and their relationship grew increasingly strained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt a deep sense of regret, his voice rough and hoarse. "Luna, I didn't know about this. Thank you both."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna's expression looked shattered, feeling that everything Diana had done back then wasn't worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your apology is cheap. You will never understand how Ms. Bishop loved you with her heart and life only to end up like this. She died. It's good she stopped loving you; now I can be at peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And the reason she didn't tell you back then was because she knew you had feelings for Queenie. She didn't want your kindness out of gratitude. All she wanted was the most ordinary kind of love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tears welled up in Luna's eyes. Diana hadn't asked for anything, yet she ended up scarred by these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who said loving with your life wouldn't be out of reach?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The person you love can be heartless. Even if you die for him, he won't feel an ounce of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt hollow when he heard that she had stopped loving him, like a dull blade slicing slowly through his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His lips pressed tightly together as he kept his eyes locked on the car ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna took a deep breath, suppressing the pain, and continued, "Mr. Gellar, I'm not saying this to make you feel guilty. I know you won't because no matter what Ms. Bishop did, it was always wrong in your eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She never planned to tell you, but I'm telling you now precisely because she didn't want to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But I can't accept it. I can't accept her making sacrifices for others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna finally released the pent-up frustration in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Other than this matter, everything else was insignificant and didn't need mentioning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once, there had been a sincere love right in front of Steven, but he had never noticed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven didn't know what he felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What did it feel like to be truly loved?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was like light in the dark, warmth in the cold, sweetness in the pain, and salvation at the brink of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's heart felt bittersweet. Back then, when he was sad, Diana would comfort him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would say, "Steven, it's okay. Believe in me. You'll get back up. Just try to trust me once, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He did believe in her, and he really did get back on his feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, only Evan and Diana were by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Diana had given up on him at that time, he would still be a failure today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, thank you for telling me this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna pressed her lips together, her cold gaze filled with icy disdain. "Steven, you owe my sister three lives. She gave you three chances, and you've used them all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was stunned, his voice dry with emotion. "Three lives? What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if he'd been struck by lightning. He heard each word clearly, but the meaning was hard to process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His heart raced, desperate for the truth. Doubt spread like wildfire inside him, but his mind was too jumbled to think. He just stared deeply at Luna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Waiting for her to give him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna remained silent as the car entered the mountain road, focusing on driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan took a deep breath. What a moving love story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He even felt envious. Steven, the fool, had finally lost it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at Luna, realizing she wasn't going to tell him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was still processing the truth he'd learned tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As they entered the mountains, the fog dispersed, and the magnificent moonlight shone brightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Under the glow of the moon, Steven's handsome face appeared pale and lost in thought.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="183.html">« Prev</a><a href="185.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
