Don't you really like me? Why won't you make me an omelet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was confused. Paige's cold, unfamiliar gaze made him feel deeply uncomfortable. But he didn't know why. He just knew that he didn't like the way she was looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank studied Paige's face, but it was still filled with an icy indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought to himself, "What's going on? Paige used to like me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige blinked, glancing at Diana, who was steering the boat, and asked in shock, "Diana, has he really lost his memory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression made her think he wasn't faking it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had reverted to his arrogant college self, which somehow made him even more irritating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana wasn't sure what to make of it either. This was different from what had happened in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wondered, "Has the interference from Paige and me changed fate in this lifetime? After Gale found out what happened, he actually apologized to me. Paula, in an effort to keep her four sons from ruining her plans, never revealed the truth about Jeff and Queenie. Could it be that this whole family has suddenly gotten smarter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head. "Paige, I don't know what's going on either. Let's just get him to the hospital for a check-up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank was clearly in pain, his vision darkening. "Diana, I know you just came home, and they might have misunderstood you. But don't worry, as long as I'm here, I'll protect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't know how to respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "What's going on? He's not paralyzed, but he's lost his memory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana remained silent, and Frank didn't press further. His body began to tremble slightly from blood loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lowering her gaze, Diana gave an order. "Paige, open my medical kit. There's a red bottle inside. Get a pill out for him. If we don't give him that, he won't make it to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige, still in shock, snapped out of her daze at the sound of Diana's voice. She glanced at the medical kit nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll give him the medicine right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By this point, Frank was slipping in and out of consciousness. In his dazed state, he felt a soft hand at his lips, giving him something to swallow. The taste was bitter, and it brought back a familiar sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly realized who it was. It was Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Paige... don't leave me..." he mumbled before passing out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige's eyes widened as she stared at Frank's pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the past year, she had done her best to forget him. No matter what had caused Frank to change, she wouldn't look back. The pain and hurt he had caused were real, and nothing could erase that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had once believed in childhood love, in the idea of romance from school days to the wedding aisle. But that wasn't what she had with Frank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An hour later, Frank was rushed into the hospital's emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, still in her diving suit, felt she had done all she could. As Frank was being treated, she returned to the hotel, took a hot shower, and stored the seafood she had caught in the refrigerator. After taking some medicine to ward off a cold, she finally allowed herself to breathe easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sitting on the hotel sofa, Diana gazed out the window at the serene blue ocean and the white sand beach. It was a beautiful view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't expected to run into Frank here, let alone end up saving him. Her feelings were complicated, and she wondered, "Is it because we share the same blood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no matter what, her heart had long since hardened. She would never forgive anyone from the Marsh family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing up, Diana went to the bathroom, drying her long hair and tying it into a ponytail. She caught her reflection in the mirror and paused for a moment, surprised by the youthful vibrance of the woman staring back at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two years she had spent married to Steven had worn her down, making her look like a middle-aged woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, this radiant and beautiful version was the real Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gently tracing her fingers over her reflection, tears suddenly welled up and fell from her eyes as she whispered to herself, "I'm sorry for how I treated you before. From now on, I won't let that happen again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would love herself first and never again place anyone else above her own well-being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood before the mirror, carefully applying skincare products and finishing with matte lipstick. Looking at her radiant reflection, she smiled in satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After packing up her skincare items, she stepped out, heading to the island hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hospital was conveniently close, just a short walk behind the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana opened the door and saw Steven and Queenie coming out of the room across the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was stunned, wondering in disbelief what they were doing here.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="385.html">« Prev</a><a href="387.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
