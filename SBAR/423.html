When I was 18, I had gotten a dual degree in integrated medicine from a foreign medical university and a domestic one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"During the two years I took care of you, I got a dual graduate degree in design. It was a well-known design university abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, I've lived with you for two years, but you've never taken the time to get to know me. Steven, my excellence is beyond your reach."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took out her phone and clicked on several university graduation certificates. "Take a good look at how many certificates and scholarships this country girl you all look down on has received over the years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was afraid that Steven would send her abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had that plan in her previous life because he didn't want her to disturb him and Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was why Diana tried so hard to avoid him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why would she avoid him? Because she couldn't beat him right now, and she needed time to grow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glanced at her phone and laughed angrily. "Diana, don't I know what you're capable of? In the two years you took care of me, what else did you do besides researching food?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe Queenie was plotting against you, but you yourself are a liar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it so hard to admit that you've failed in life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked tearfully, "Steven, is it so hard to admit that I am excellent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She understood that Steven didn't believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, Steven did not believe it. He had his men investigate Diana. Her background was clean, and she grew up in the countryside. When her eldest brother went to pick her up, she was brought home covered in mud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I know you were upset because you were plotted against before, but it's best to make yourself better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've contacted universities abroad..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up! Who are you to me? What right do you have to dictate how I live my live?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana warned Steven coldly. Seeing Luna's car coming, she opened the door and got in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood there with a gloomy face, watching the car driving away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He believed that Diana had some medical skills, but she was not as good as she said she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He believed in the design thing because her designs were excellent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned around, got into the car on the side of the road, and drove back to the old residence. Although he was angry just now, he was worried that she would be in danger, so he chased after her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that the danger was over, he felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana returned home and took a hot bath. She lay on the bed, and when she thought about Steven's words, she almost had a mental breakdown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's arrogant and selfish. I shouldn't care about the words of a philandering man. If I do, I'll give myself blocked breasts," she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah..." Diana rolled on the bed in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn Steven!" Diana rolled again and fell to the ground at last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh!" She stood up, looked out the window, sneered, and said to herself, "Tsk, why should I be so sad? Isn't it enough for me to understand how excellent I am?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath to suppress the pain inside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she closed her eyes, but tears welled up in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It still hurts!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who said if you looked up, tears wouldn't fall?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why does my heart hurt so much when my eyes are closed?" Diana wondered.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="422.html">« Prev</a><a href="424.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
