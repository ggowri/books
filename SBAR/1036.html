Then it clicked. "I haven't seen Dylan in over a year. Is he back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna frowned, trying to place where she'd seen him before. Then it hit her&mdash;she'd seen him in photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "If Dylan's here, Queenie must be too, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a bite of her food before responding, "It's possible. Dylan and Queenie have always been close. Plus, he's been overseas for the past two years, so his views are pretty open-minded. He probably sees Queenie's situation differently than Paula and the others do. And the most important thing is&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna interrupted with a laugh, "The most important thing is that he's an idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had to admit that was a pretty blunt way of putting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Jeff, Queenie and Dylan had his personality&mdash;just as deceitful and shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick looked worried. "Diana, do you think he'll help Queenie go after you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana could respond, both she and Luna spoke at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a given."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like they could read each other's minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled at Luna, her eyes bright and beautiful, her voice tinged with amusement. "Luna, you really know the Marsh family best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna noticed the smile, but deep down, she felt sad. She knew what Diana truly cared about was family&mdash;otherwise, she wouldn't have stuck it out all these years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, Julius is almost back. He said he'd come back to celebrate your birthday, and when he does, he'll throw you a big birthday party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that Julius was coming back made Diana even happier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eat up, then we'll head home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was in a good mood&mdash;she would not let Queenie's little schemes ruin it. She didn't even want to see Queenie today. Diana was waiting for her to make her move, and when she did, Diana would be ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and the others knew how much Diana valued relationships, so they stayed quiet, letting her enjoy the moment in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they were all full, Diana casually pulled out a napkin and wiped her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in her wheelchair, feeling uncomfortable from the meal, she looked at Barry across from her. "Barry, when we get back tonight, can you make me a pot of coffee? I ate too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stew was delicious, but it was easy to overeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Diana, are you really keeping a bunch of toy boys around? And you're letting them make coffee?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, how can you be so shameless? Don't you ever tell anyone you're my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was leaning casually next to Diana, his eyes full of disdain as he looked her up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a trendy puffer jacket, jeans, and a thick chain hanging from his pants. His ears were adorned with skull-shaped earrings&mdash;definitely on the cutting edge of fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his hair, it was long, choppy, and slightly messy, dyed bright green.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a guy who screamed "cool."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him sat Queenie in a wheelchair&mdash;today she was using one, though it looked like her beauty was only temporary. It seemed she could only hold on to it for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sized him up, meeting his angry gaze, before speaking in a calm, steady voice. "What's it to you if I have toy boys? Does it bother you? We have nothing to do with </span><span>each other, so why are you even talking to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already cut ties with the Marsh family a long time ago. I have brothers of my own. Who do you think you are, calling yourself my brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was taken aback. He thought, "Is this the same Diana who used to stay quiet and avoid confrontation when I left? Since when did she get so sharp-tongued?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was furious. "Diana, how dare you talk to me like that? I'm your brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gave a cold, sarcastic smile. Her eyes, beautiful and aloof, were like a vast night sky&mdash;deep and impossible to read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother? What kind of brother are you? Which brother would openly accuse his own sister of having toy boys?" Diana shot him a mocking look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But weren't you in love with Steven before? You're hanging around with two handsome guys now&mdash;does your love really mean that little?" Dylan tried to come up with an excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick and Barry were both furious, ready to knock some sense into Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh," Diana scoffed, pointing to Queenie beside him. "You really have the nerve to say that? Don't you know the relationship between Steven and Queenie? She knew I was married to Steven, but she still went after him, practically begging to be the other woman. Why don't you go talk to her about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was fuming, especially because Diana always put her in her place about this issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan shot back quickly, "That's because you have no shame. Everyone knows Steven loves Queenie, and you stole her fianc&eacute; from under her nose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk." Diana clicked her tongue lightly. "You people, you're the most shameless family I've ever met. Queenie gave up on Steven after his injury. And you all made me marry him to secure the business deal between the Marsh and Gellar families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And in the end, you're all blaming me for 'stealing' Queenie's fianc&eacute;? Are you all out of your minds? When things go well, it's all for Queenie, and when they go wrong, it's my fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I cut ties with all of you over a year ago. Don't talk to me when you see me. I don't know you, Dylan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you're just throwing a tantrum," Dylan snapped. "You owe Queenie an apology. What you just said is going to really hurt her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was fuming. The old Diana had always been quiet and obedient. Now, she was acting completely out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to </span><span>Queenie,</span><span> her smile sharp. "Queenie, do I owe you an apology?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled sweetly, "If you apologize, I'd accept it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna shook her head. "The Marsh family... it's not just one or two of them who have issues; it's all of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you to say anything?" Dylan snapped at Luna, glaring at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was furious. She pointed at Dylan and yelled, "You idiot! Gale is paralyzed, Frank is missing, and Eric's career is ruined&mdash;all because of Queenie. And you're still helping her </span><span>bully</span><span> Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's their choice," Dylan sneered. "If they had chosen to help Queenie, would they have ended up like that? They got what they deserved because they refused to help </span><span>Queenie take down Diana. How is that Queenie's fault?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie is the one we grew up with, while Diana is just some bastard with an unknown father. How does she even have the right to be my sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Mom's making a mountain out of a molehill. What's the big deal? Every man cheats these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's also Dad's daughter, and she's the one Mom raised. What's the problem with spoiling her a little?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Mom hadn't given up on Queenie, she never would've gone after the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not around, and this whole family's falling apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna, Nick, and Barry all stared at Dylan in disbelief. How could anyone be this blind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, however, remained eerily calm, though a small pang of pain twisted inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did all these emotions feel like they were crashing together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt so hurt, as though every part of her body was aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie, watching the pain flicker in Diana's eyes, smiled smugly, her voice dripping with satisfaction. "Diana, you're really hurting, aren't you? Not everyone buys into your little act. Dylan's right&mdash;you're nothing but a bastard with an unknown father."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1035.html">« Prev</a><a href="1037.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
