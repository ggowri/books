"Tonight's event isn't a particularly important one. Mrs. Foliot just gathered everyone here to put on a show. Now that the show's over, everyone is free to do as they please. Whether I stay with you or not doesn't matter. Go take care of your own business."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to avoid drawing too much attention in a public setting, and she had no desire to be linked to Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had her own plans in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Steven hadn't supported Queenie tonight, Queenie would undoubtedly try even harder to win Steven back. With Samuel getting out of prison soon, Queenie's schemes against Diana would only increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things were about to get even more interesting but also more dangerous for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Steven sat down beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil glared at him in irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, shouldn't you be with your Queenie? What's the big idea in interrupting us? Can't you see we're having dinner?" Cecil's handsome face was full of complaints, with a hint of challenge in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven knew Cecil was doing this on purpose. He didn't take the young man seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, what do you think of my looks?" Cecil suddenly asked, tilting his face toward her with a bright expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was momentarily taken aback. "What is Cecil trying to do?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she played along and smiled, replying, "Very handsome! You have a great vibe."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was unsatisfied with her answer. He narcissistically began listing his own virtues. "Diana, if we're talking about looks, I'm definitely more attractive. In terms of talent, I'm exceptional. And in terms of age, we're a perfect match.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unlike some people, who are old and dull. Diana, if you ever get divorced, could you consider me first? I'm only going to get better, and my graduation thesis just passed with flying colors. My professor said I'm amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a confident, wickedly charming smile that curled at the corners of his lips as if it carried a mysterious magic that irresistibly drew people in.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was momentarily stunned, feeling a little regretful for answering his question in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Steven, who wore an extremely dark expression as if someone had their sights set on his prized possession. Steven's icy gaze seemed ready to tear Cecil apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that Steven wasn't acting out of care for her. It was more about his possessive nature, his strong sense of ownership over what he deemed as his.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding air seemed to grow colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil met Steven's murderous glare and pretended to shrink back, wrapping his arms around Diana's. "Diana, his stare is terrifying! He's scaring me again," he said, playing the frightened victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana silently lowered her head, struggling not to burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "How did I not notice before that Cecil is such a drama king?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deciding to play along, Diana furrowed her brows at Steven. "Mr. Gellar, your expression is too serious. It's scaring me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's jaw was tightly clenched as he stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought to himself with a sneer, "So, they really seem cozy together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, you may be acting defiant now, but just wait until we're back under the same roof. There will be consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's tone was calm but laced with menace. "Diana, your elder brother's project recently ran into some issues, and I was planning to send someone to help. But with your current behavior, there's no need to send help."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished speaking and got up, walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implication was clear that he expected Diana to chase after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was used to Diana running after him, so he instinctively left her with only the sight of his back as he walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at his retreating figure, wishing her gaze could turn into a blade and pierce right through his chest, erasing him from this world for good.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="652.html">« Prev</a><a href="654.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
