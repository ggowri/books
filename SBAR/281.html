The events of the night had scared her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she left, a sinister smile crept onto the face of the person seated in the luxurious car nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon her return home, Queenie saw Penelope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, you're back!" Penelope exclaimed, taking her hand with delight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing Queenie's reddened and swollen face, Penelope asked in shock, "Queenie, what happened? Who hit you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's expression darkened, and she was reluctant to engage. "I'm fine. What brings you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope had merely been a pawn in her game, and now that her purpose was served, she had no use for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sensing her foul mood, Penelope replied truthfully, "Queenie, Gale transferred his shares to you before he left. You promised to send me a portion of it on the 15th of each month. Today is the 15th, and I've come for the money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie had agreed to give her money solely to deceive Gale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So upon hearing that, Queenie smiled and responded, "Penelope, you haven't even married Gale yet, and you're already eyeing his money. If my mother knew, she would think you're after him for his money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Moreover, our family business is facing a crisis. I don't have much moneny."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Penelope, taken aback, recalled Diana's warning that she was just a pawn of Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, even if the company is going through rough times, dividends should still be distributed. So, you have to give me my money," Penelope urged, hoping to avoid a falling out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To temporarily appease Penelope, Queenie could only transfer tens of thousands of dollars to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She then looked at Penelope in embarrassment. "The more you demand from me, the less likely my mother will approve of your marriage to Gale. He's currently overseas for treatment, and you should consider your future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You know that the child you carry isn't Gale's," she added, delivering a threat to Penelope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outraged, Penelope retorted, "Queenie, you promised to keep that a secret!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What secret?" Queenie's grandma, Tracey Marsh, came out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Tracey, Queenie Queenie smiled and deflected, "Grandma, it's nothing. Why are you still up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Observing Queenie and the empty living room, Tracey sighed, "I'm waiting for your mother. It's late, and she's not home yet. A woman should be tending to her household and let the man to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She should hand over the business to your father, yet she is reluctant to let it go. She never sees us as family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracey was displeased because she didn't receive her living expenses from Jeff this month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie smiled, offering reassurance to Tracey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Diana, who had just returned home, received a message from her informant: [Your grandparents are here, and Penelope is here to ask Queenie for money.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon reading the message, Diana sneered, anticipating the unfolding drama.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="280.html">« Prev</a><a href="282.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
