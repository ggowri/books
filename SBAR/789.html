Why had he come back this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you not going to see Queenie? She's in the hospital," she probed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven raised his eyebrows at her remark. Taking off his jacket, he placed it casually by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath it, he wore a black shirt, revealing hints of his well-defined abs.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he got up and took a seat next to her, his powerful presence filling the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He undid the top two buttons of his shirt, exuding a restrained yet untamed allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt the intensity of his presence, making her feel a bit insecure. She shifted slightly, pulling her child closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why sit so close? It feels... uncomfortable," she said, her tone a bit unnatural.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's demeanor was always domineering. He turned his head slightly to look at her, his gaze icy. "You'd really prefer I go to someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied calmly, "It's not what I prefer. We'll be done soon enough. Who you go to is your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," he said, his voice cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shifted further away, holding her child protectively to avoid any harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven noticed and smirked faintly. "Are you really that scared of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, scared. Why wouldn't I be? When you're angry, you're terrifying."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wary eyes held a guarded look. After all, Steven had hit her before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To put it bluntly, he wasn't exactly kind&mdash;his temper could be brutal, and he wouldn't hesitate to lash out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven chuckled in exasperation. His laughter was genuinely attractive, and if she could overlook everything he'd done, it was almost soothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did hit you that one time in a fit of anger, but I did let you hit me back afterward. If you're still upset, feel free to hit me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I'm not the type to hit people easily, and there's no point in hitting you now. I'm done with you&mdash;why bother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath, each of her words reminding him she wanted to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't keep bringing up leaving. You promised we'd divorce in a year."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I did. Because I know you didn't want a divorce at first. Now that you've agreed, one year will pass quickly. So why is it wrong for me to keep my distance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt that he had changed. Before, he'd disappear for months without seeing her. But ever since she'd left, he seemed to show up every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of logic was this?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her uneasy every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, tempted to hold her captive at his side so she could never leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't hit women. That one time, I was provoked by your words. And the bodyguard incident? All evidence pointed to you, yet I did nothing. It was just meant to scare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!" Diana scoffed. "Why bring up the past? Every time you do, I get furious. Steven, I hope you understand. The problem isn't about the bodyguard hitting me; it's about you. As your wife, you didn't give me the respect I deserved, only consequences to pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When others bullied me, and when the Marsh family insulted me, you joined them in tormenting me. I will never turn back, nor will I forgive the Marsh family. Even if we're connected by blood, they'll never be forgiven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know, if I had stepped in, Gale's leg wouldn't be disabled? I even tried to stop him from competing, but he wouldn't listen. He thought Queenie, his precious sister, would never harm him&mdash;and now he's crippled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just like them. Your change doesn't mean I'll forgive you. Got it? Then leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana gestured to the door, keeping herself calm. She reminded herself not to get angry. Steven had no self-awareness at all.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="788.html">« Prev</a><a href="790.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
