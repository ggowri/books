She wanted to yell at him but didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know how.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she was a kid, all she could say was "jerk," and nothing else would come out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold said back then, "Sweet pea, if you</span><span>'</span><span>re gonna curse, do it with some flair. Let me teach you how to really curse him..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But all she could manage was, "Bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana laughed and asked, "What should I call you? A heartless jerk? But we</span><span>'</span><span>re not even in love. We</span><span>'</span><span>re just married in name."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don</span><span>'</span><span>t even have the right to call you a heartless jerk."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt a sharp pain in his chest, silently watching her in distress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana noticed his gaze and turned her head to look at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no defense against this version of Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a helpless smile. "Fool, you can call me whatever you want. I can take it, as long as it eases your pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was gentle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's heart was moved. She clung tightly to his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His light gray robe was tugged open slightly by her, revealing his toned chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana flashed him a mischievous smile and did something he hadn't dared to do for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tonight, she could use his guilt to do what she never dared before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lifted his robe, exposing his abs, and traced her fingers lightly over them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The firm texture made her marvel at the raw power contained within his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana realized she was craving Steven's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let her hands wander over Steven's abs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His breathing grew quick and uneven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slowly leaned closer to Diana, sensing her breath growing just as unsteady.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven lifted his hand gently, hesitated for a moment, then brushed his fingers softly against her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a low voice, he asked, "Diana, do you know what you're doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His captivating voice was utterly spellbinding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked a little shy, her lashes fluttering softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smirked mischievously, her fingers lightly teasing Steven's nipple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soft touch sent a shiver through him, making him take a deep breath as his grip on her tightened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven leaned in slightly, his lips close to her ear, and whispered, "Diana, do you know the consequences of this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt weak all over, her mind completely blank.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his warning, she lifted her head to meet his gaze. Time seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana spoke softly, "I know. I'm punishing you for bullying me. If you dare to do it again, I swear you'll never see me for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven murmured, "No, Diana. No one will ever dare to hurt you again, not even me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gentle and heartfelt promise made Diana feel even more intoxicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let out a soft hum, "Steven, smart move."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her soft hands instinctively reached up to his shoulders. She tilted her head, exposing her neck, and gazed at Steven with dreamy eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her dazed expression, and he could no longer hold back his desire. He leaned down and kissed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The kiss made Diana's body tremble slightly, but she only held him tighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's kisses trailed down, brushing past her jawline, lingering on her collarbone. Each kiss burned like fire, as if trying to fuse their souls together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a long while before Steven reluctantly let her go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked, staring at Steven who had suddenly stopped. Doubt crept in&mdash;was her charm not enough?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He actually stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt like she was about to lose it, wondering why she was having such a strange thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was actually anticipating Steven making love to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blinked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "Diana, you're not thinking straight right now. I want to feel my love for you when you're fully aware."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him an angry glare, pulled up the blanket, and went to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I must have looked so desperate just now. How embarrassing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her hiding under the blanket and let out a helpless laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted her to make love with him when she was fully conscious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled back the blanket and wrapped his arms around Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, feeling tired and a bit tipsy from the drinks, quickly fell asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven envied her ability to sleep so easily. It was the first time he'd met someone who could fall asleep that quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven kissed her forehead gently before picking up his phone. He sent Edward a quick message, letting him know they'd be vacationing on the island for the next few days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward said, "Steven, the danger's over now. You better step up. If you lose Diana, you won't find another girl this amazing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew that if he lost Diana, he'd never find another girl who loved him this much again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He replied, "Grandpa, I understand. I'll do my best."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward said, "As for your father, we'll talk about it properly when you get back. He had no choice back then. He's had a tough time all these years. To keep the truth from you, to track down everyone in the Mysterium Organization, we've all been through a lot. But remember, we all love you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a simple reply, then put down his phone and held Diana close as they drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Paula's house, it was only at this moment that they realized there were two identical Stevens&mdash;one of them was fake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They finally realized that the Steven with Queenie was the fake one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale let out a cold laugh. "Queenie is something else, isn</span><span>'</span><span>t she? None of us knew she found a man who looks exactly like Steven to set him up. And they</span><span>'</span><span>re married, no less. How many secrets is she keeping from us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric looked at Gale with a smile. "Gale, she</span><span>'</span><span>s always been vicious. Their goal is simple&mdash;to take over the Gellar Group. Kill Steven, and they get it handed to them on a silver platter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No wonder Queenie kept framing Diana. She wanted to get rid of her so she could marry Steven. Then George kills Steven, and they take his place. All that wealth would be theirs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula closed her eyes tightly, staying silent for a long moment before finally looking at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spoke in agony, "Diana knew all of this. Without her warning, our family would</span><span>'</span><span>ve been ruined long ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And we knew nothing, even siding with Queenie to bully her. I don</span><span>'</span><span>t deserve to be her mother."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1091.html">« Prev</a><a href="1093.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
