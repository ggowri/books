Diana's voice faltered as she stepped into the room, her eyes landing on the two of them locked in an embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A flicker of pain crossed her features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought, "Is this why Steven wanted me to come over? To watch them flaunt their love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze shot to Diana, and he felt a jolt of guilt surge through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He pushed Queenie away, her body stumbling to the ground in a heap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She glared at Steven's retreating figure, her expression darkening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, let me explain..." he started.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana snapped, her voice laced with bitterness, "Explain what? How passionate your night was with her? You called me over just to show off your little love fest?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I remember when you were just cold, but at least you weren't this despicable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's true what they say&mdash;you become like the company you keep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana turned on her heel, not wanting to linger in this painful scene for another moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, come back here!" Steven's voice rose in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie wore a smug smile, watching Diana storm away with a sense of satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought, surprised that Diana had returned at all, "What perfect timing. Sometimes, the universe just aligns perfectly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Slowly, she rose from the floor and sauntered over to Steven, wrapping her arm around his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, she doesn't want to come back. Why force it? Her heart hasn't been with you for a long time. Since she left, she's been with a string of other men. Don't you remember the promises you made to me back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked up at him with tear-filled eyes, her expression one of feigned vulnerability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven yanked his arm away and shrugged off his jacket, tossing it aside in disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie froze, her heart sinking as she registered the contempt in his actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had always been the one to indulge her, to shower her with affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, that look of disdain cut deep, leaving Queenie reeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Wha...what does this mean, Steven?" Her voice trembled, a mixture of hurt and anger bubbling beneath the surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What does it mean? Can't you see? Queenie, you've already drained me dry. You saved me. I've given you billions over the years to clear our slate. Do whatever you want from now on, but if you dare to scheme against me and Diana, I'll make sure to take back every penny, with interest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had never been a good man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie's eyes widened in shock; then she erupted into laughter. "Ha! So this is it, isn't it? You're just disgusted that I'm from the Marsh family. But is blood really that important?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm the one who grew up with you, not Diana. Have you forgotten all the happy times we shared?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've known since childhood that I was meant to marry you. I rejected every suitor just to stay by your side. It was your mother who drove me away, not me abandoning you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Enough! Get out of my house&mdash;now!" Steven shouted, his patience wearing thin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie bit her lip, fury boiling inside her. She could see the indifference etched on Steven's handsome face, and she knew she had pushed him to the edge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't dare test the limits of his rage any further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven had grown up in darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wasn't a good man, and while she could read his temper, his thoughts remained a mystery to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sinking into the sofa, he felt the chill of the room seep into him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment, he dialed Evan's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar," Evan said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had witnessed Diana storming out, followed closely by Queenie, who was wiping tears from her eyes.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="167.html">« Prev</a><a href="169.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
