Later, when Queenie called her mother to ask about it, she learned that Amelie had been in contact with Mark for quite some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled awkwardly, "Dad, don't overthink it. Mom met Mr. Foliot to help you with a business deal. Mrs. Foilot saw them together and misunderstood, thinking Mom was a mistress. Mom was beaten and is still in the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was a man who naturally could see through the truth. In the end, he had wronged Amelie. But still... "Forget it. Go get some rest. I'll be fine after a nap. I'll watch my diet from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff's problem wasn't just about high blood pressure, cholesterol, and sugar. It was that he could no longer be a real man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't be bothered to say much more. The sooner Jeff died, the lighter her burden would be. Paula's assets would soon be hers, and Jeff had lost his value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Queenie left, she went to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Cecil headed to work. Just as he arrived at the office entrance, reporters and investigators blocked his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's assistant and bodyguards quickly surrounded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the investigators stepped forward, looking at Cecil, and said, "Mr. Farley, we received a report that your company used substandard materials for one of your real estate projects. Officials from the construction, safety, and quality inspection departments are already on-site. We need your cooperation in this investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil glanced at the swarm of reporters not far away. Before the facts had even been clarified, the news had already spread like wildfire. The entire internet buzzed with stories about the Farley Group's use of faulty construction materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, it was Queenie who filed the report. Wyatt's family was busy welcoming Samuel home from prison today. The couple cherished their son like their own life, so there was no way they had time to pull this off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be Queenie. Crafty as she was, she didn't leave any solid evidence. But that didn't mean it was completely untraceable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil looked at the crowd and smiled, "Since all your departments are already here, let's head to the site. I want the entire inspection process to be made public. The Farley Group's reputation must not be tarnished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Cecil finished speaking, a reporter shoved a microphone in his face. "Mr. Farley, using substandard building materials, what if there are issues when the homes are handed over? Can you answer those buyers who trusted the Farley Group? They worked their whole lives, putting their hard-earned money into buying their only home. If there's a quality issue, it would devastate them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil cut the reporter off, his voice steady and firm. "I understand you're concerned about the buyers. But if you're so worried, why only listen to one side of the story? Why not wait for the results of the quality inspection?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing has been settled. You're exaggerating the situation and causing unnecessary panic among homebuyers. As a reporter, you haven't even checked the facts, yet you're blowing things out of proportion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a journalist, truth is the foundation of your work. It's your responsibility to report the facts with objectivity, accuracy, and fairness. No exaggerations, no omissions, no distortions. You haven't even visited my construction site, and you're already claiming there's a problem with the materials?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil stood tall in his black coat, the cold wind whipping around him. A faint smile played on his handsome face, his mature demeanor contrasting with the youthful energy in his smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reporter was taken aback and at a loss for words. He thought, "Isn't Cecil just a spoiled, arrogant playboy? How could he respond so logically and confidently?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="526.html">« Prev</a><a href="528.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
