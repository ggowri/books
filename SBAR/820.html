Where your wife's body, I think you should know better than anyone. Lily exposed your affair, and in your anger and resentment, you killed her. You have the strongest motive here, so why are you so quick to accuse me, someone entirely uninvolved?" Diana smiled as she retorted, her clear gaze fixed intently on Mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark felt a pang of guilt under her stare. He had assumed that with the appearance of new evidence, Diana would no longer dare act so boldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he hadn't expected her defiance to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm a man. I only made the same mistake that all men make..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not your wife, so don't try justifying yourself to me. Whatever mistakes you made are none of my concern. I'm here to resolve this case. You're accusing me of killing your wife. What possible motive would I have? Does the motive you're proposing even make sense? Just because I had a failed business deal with her? But as shown in the footage from that night, do you really think she felt like a failure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark, your tactics are as despicable as they are shameless. Do you think you're the only one with evidence? The proof I have will ensure you can never recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned to the officer again. "Officer, Mr. Foliot's mistress is Amelie, who happens to be Queenie's biological mother. Queenie resents me for being Paula's daughter, and the three of them have joined forces. Regardless of whether I'm guilty or innocent, their goal is to destroy my reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer cast a sharp look at Mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, reporters streamed the scene live, and comments began to flood the chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She seems kind-hearted and beautiful. There's no way she's a killer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be fooled by her innocent appearance; bad people never see themselves as guilty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you speak so righteously? Do you even realize the wrongs you've done? Some people state their vile actions with complete confidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comments section was quickly filled with debate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, how can you keep making excuses? Do you know what my wife's death has done to me and my children, the psychological trauma we've suffered?" Mark's eyes turned red with emotion as he accused her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled bitterly, looking up at him with a hint of mockery in her gaze. "Mr. Foliot, let me remind you. Both your daughter and son have already been won over by Amelie. They call your mistress 'mom.' The four of you seem eager to live happily ever after, it's only natural that you'd prefer your wife out of the picture."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about, Diana? Stop lying! Where is my wife? Give me back her body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark's face twisted with anger as he shouted, his hands shaking, his body trembling, and his expression contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood tall, her voice steady and resolute. "Mr. Foliot, only you know where your wife is. I'm young and beautiful, and I have no reason to throw my life away by killing someone's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And by the way, if you're so eager to put on a show, please don't use me as your practice. I'm not as naive as you might think. You should know the consequences of framing someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had actual evidence, would you really be parading this in front of the media? No, your only goal here is to ruin my name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Mark's face turned increasingly pale, Diana pressed on, "Mr. Foliot, shouting into the media spotlight or planting evidence by stealing a random piece of clothing doesn't make me guilty. If framing someone was that easy, then the entire legal profession might as well shut down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark was momentarily speechless.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="819.html">« Prev</a><a href="821.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
