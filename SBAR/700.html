Everything that happened between us was just for fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold a press conference and announce that you are not pregnant, and that Diana has a grudge against you and is deliberately tarnishing your reputation. Then have your agency release the poster for your new movie. Based on my experience, this crisis will boost your fame.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, this time it can help you gain more fans, with Diana being your stepping stone. There's a charity gala for heart disease donations tonight. You can go to make a donation and make the media heavily publicize it; that way, you can clear your name."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie narrowed her eyes. Levi had been in the industry for many years and was very familiar with these tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was also Diana who framed her. After multiple incidents of being set up, she was already close to total disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi gave her another suggestion. "Queenie, wait a bit longer. When things have developed to a certain point, then hold a press conference and expose all the times Diana has plotted against you. Do you understand what I mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie understood what he meant. She said with a sneer, "I know. It's such a pity for our child to become our stepping stone. I had a dream; he should be a boy."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without giving him any chance to say anything, she just hung up the phone with hideous malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi could only be used by her. He was not yet qualified to be her man.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a light laugh. Indeed, after becoming pregnant, she had become somewhat foolish; before, she could easily manipulate Diana, but now, she had become so passive.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she could win against Paula, dealing with Diana shouldn't be a problem either.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and decided to let things develop further.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie summoned Mario into her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario came in quickly and asked, "Ms. Marsh, what should we do now? The situation is getting intense."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very worried because Queenie had just grown up and any small thing could ruin her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the master put in a lot of effort to elevate her to her current status.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gave a faint smile. "It's okay, I've already thought of a solution. I will hold a press conference later and tell everyone that those are just fake news made up by Diana to defame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario had been following her for many years, and as soon as Queenie spoke, he got her plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded with a smile. "Great! I'll start preparing right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in her room, Diana was drawing design sketches. Today, she turned her anger into motivation, and her inspiration was excellent; every stroke flowed smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was painting with great enthusiasm when Luna called her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had just finished drawing a design. She picked it up and looked at it with a smile, feeling very satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw her phone vibrating, so she picked it up and saw it was Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna?" she answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna said, "Diana, have you seen the news? Queenie is pregnant with Levi's child."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was shocked and asked, "Are you sure Queenie is pregnant with Levi's child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Could this be the reason why Steven said those inexplicable words?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after thinking about it, she felt that Queenie couldn't possibly be lying. She didn't believe that the child Queenie was carrying was Levi's.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Internet is in chaos right now, but Levi hasn't made any statement. Everyone is calling for him to come out and explain, and it's causing quite a stir online," Luna added.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly startled when she thought of Queenie's words. "Could it be that Queenie lied to me and that she is not pregnant with Steven's child?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="699.html">« Prev</a><a href="701.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
