She had spent two years in Avernia and could speak the simple language, and she spoke it to a high standard.</p><p>Queenie repeated what she had just said.</p><p>But Henry still looked confused.</p><p>Henry added, &quot;I&#x27;m not feeling well, and I need a doctor.&quot;</p><p>Queenie thought Henry had heard her, so she took his hand and smiled with joy, &quot;Hello, Mr. James, it&#x27;s an honor to meet you!&quot;</p><p>Henry can understand Queenie&#x27;s words. He frowned, his forehead filled with wrinkles, and he looked furious.</p><p>Diana almost burst out laughing at Queenie&#x27;s reaction.</p><p>She knew Henry didn&#x27;t have a good temper.</p><p>Queenie had a challenge.</p><p>Henry suddenly became furious and shook off Queenie&#x27;s hand.</p><p>&quot;You can&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m saying. Why don&#x27;t you get out? If you&#x27;re losing your mind, please go to a neurologist.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah...&quot; Queenie fell into Steven&#x27;s arms.</p><p>&quot;Well...&quot; Diana finally couldn&#x27;t help but laugh.</p><p>Queenie glared at her.</p><p>Steven also warned Diana to stay out of trouble with a look.</p><p>Henry looked angrily at Alexander, whom he only knew. &quot;I need someone who can understand me to help.&quot;</p><p>Alexander didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about, so he looked at Diana pleadingly, and he trusted her.</p><p>Diana smiled and walked over. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Mr. James, the young lady wasn&#x27;t with us just now.</p><p>Diana scared Queenie with her fluent knowledge of Avernia.</p><p>How could she know this language?</p><p>Didn&#x27;t she not graduate from high school?</p><p>Queenie thought about what she had just advised Diana to do and felt nothing but shame.</p><p>Steven&#x27;s eyes were filled with shock as he thought, &quot;How could Diana speak the language of Avernia?&quot;</p><p>Henry breathed a sigh of relief, a faint smile on his face, and there was finally someone who could understand what he was saying.</p><p>He came out in a hurry this time, so he only brought his assistant with him.</p><p>However, his assistant was sick.</p><p>The cooperation tonight was crucial. Alexander was young and talented, and Henry liked the young man so much that he wanted to return home as soon as possible after signing the contract.</p><p>&quot;Okay, thank you! Girl, you&#x27;re so pretty!&quot;</p><p>Diana was a bit shy of his compliments.</p><p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. James. You are kind and amiable.&quot;</p><p>Diana exchanged a few words with Henry, Alexander was there with Diana all the time.</p><p>Steven and Queenie are also sitting on the side.</p><p>Queenie was anxious that she had screwed up tonight.</p><p>There were many languages in Avernia, and they were made up of several ethnic groups, so it was different in each place. Queenie just knew the common language.</p><p>What should she do?</p><p>Diana couldn&#x27;t be better than her.</p><p>Queenie glanced at Steven secretly as he sat there calmly, his handsome face expressionless.</p><p>He looked no different in demeanor than Alexander, who was across from him, the heir to the Powell family, and how on earth did Diana know her?</p><p>Queenie was jealous and helpless.</p><p>Henry smiled and nodded. &quot;Pretty girl, let&#x27;s get down to business.&quot;</p><p>Diana nodded and looked over at Alexander. &quot;Mr. Powell, can we get down to business now?&quot;</p><p>Diana introduced Henry to Alexander and Steven.</p><p>She had just heard Henry say he wanted to talk business with Steven, so she introduced Steven by the way.</p><p>She didn&#x27;t want to interact too much with Steven. In this life, she only wanted the people she cared about to be safe and healthy. By the way, she wished to make Queenie suffer punishment.</p><p>Steven didn&#x27;t expect Diana to be willing to translate for him.</p><p>Diana compared Alexander&#x27;s cooperation intentions with Henry one by one. She looked serious, spoke fluently, and answered correctly.</p><p>Whatever Henry proposed, she could express it quickly and accurately.</p><p>It was two hours later when Alexander finished his work.</p><p>Diana only felt thirsty and decided to translate for Steven anyway so as not to get Henry, the great entrepreneur, to get too tired.</p><p>She took a sip of water before looking at Steven for his opinion. &quot;Mr. Gellar, do you need me to translate your plans for you? If it&#x27;s not convenient for you, we&#x27;re going to leave now.&quot;</p><p>Steven didn&#x27;t hesitate to hand over his plans after hearing her words.</p><p>Diana had never betrayed Steven, so he was relieved to have Diana.</p><p>&quot;Thank you.&quot; His tone was indifferent and polite.</p><p>Diana nodded faintly and began to read word for word to Henry.</p><p>If Henry didn&#x27;t get it, she would explain it a few more times, thus making it clear to him. Then, she would read the next sentence.</p><p>Diana looked at Steven seriously. &quot;Mr. Gellar, Mr. James said whether you would give up one percent of the profit because the tax is high. If you give up one percent of the profit, you won&#x27;t lose anything. He said he was a really honest businessman, and he liked to work with people he could trust. If you can give up one percent of the profit, he&#x27;ll sign the contract right away.&quot;</p><p>Steven looked at her expectant eyes, and the one percent profit was what he expected.</p><p>Henry had always known how to make a profit in the business world.</p><p>Queenie, however, didn&#x27;t agree with it. &quot;Diana, how did you translate that? Do you know how much money one percent of profit is?&quot;</p><p>Diana frowned, &quot;If I don&#x27;t understand it, you&#x27;ll get it, and you can tell me.&quot;</p><p>Queenie was speechless.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t understand what they were saying at all.</p><p>&quot;Diana, I know you&#x27;re amazing, but you can&#x27;t destroy Steven in the business world...&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s enough. Stop it.&quot; Steven interrupted Queenie indifferently.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="40.html">« Prev</a><a href="42.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
