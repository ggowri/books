"No, Dad, you've been with me all along. I remember when I was eight, I saw you sitting in your car watching me. I saw you when I was in college too, and twice when I was abroad. You never abandoned me&mdash;you were protecting me from the shadows, watching me grow up. All my toys and clothes were bought by you, Dad. That was your love."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I never blamed you, Dad. And I've forgiven Mom too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop's face darkened at the mention of Paula. As Diana's biological mother, Paula had failed her daughter miserably, but he was grateful she'd given birth to Diana. Over the years, he'd supported them financially. It was because Paula had given him Diana that he'd ensured her security for life. Still, she'd ultimately let Diana down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana slipped her arm through her father's and pulled him toward Steven. "Dad, this is my husband Steven, and these are my in-laws and grandparents."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, these are my three brothers. You should know them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, yes, I know them all. Even though I wasn't by your side, I kept tabs on everyone around you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the introductions, Copper Bishop's cold stare fixed on Steven. "Steven, I was incredibly disappointed in you, but my daughter loves you, so what choice do I have?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was planning to bring my daughter back to Bishop Manor after your divorce and find her a better husband."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My daughter is exceptional. She could have any man she wanted. I won't stand for you treating my daughter like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop was angry enough to say this right in front of Steven's parents. Steven apologized earnestly. "Dad, I know I screwed up, but please don't marry Diana off to someone else. She's mine now, and we're having a baby&mdash;twins, actually. I'll protect all three of them from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Twins?" Copper Bishop lit up, reaching out to steady Diana. "Diana, you need to be extra careful now. No more running around like you just did. The Bishop bloodline continues."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled happily. "Dad, I'm starving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She really was hungry today. She couldn't keep anything down on the plane and just slept the whole time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop said excitedly, "Perfect! I've got lunch ready. Let's go home and eat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop looked at Leopold. "Dad, let's get everyone in the cars&mdash;the whole family. We'll head back for lunch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Young family was on edge, but when they heard Copper Bishop say "the whole family," they all exhaled in relief. Leopold and Edward both broke into grins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leopold said, "Old friend, we're family now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edward was beaming. "In-law, I should be thanking you. My grandson wouldn't be where he is today without you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha ha&mdash;" Leopold laughed heartily. This perfect ending wasn't too shabby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone piled into the cars and headed back to the castle. They drove through stunning flower fields, and the white castle sat quietly on emerald green lawns. Below the castle stretched an endless cityscape. Wide stone steps led to heavy carved doors, and stepping inside felt like entering another world. The spacious, soaring hall was bright and airy, with massive crystal chandeliers that made the entire space shimmer with golden light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Copper Bishop smiled and asked, "Diana, do you like our home?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1178.html">« Prev</a><a href="1180.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
