If you hadn&rsquo;t kicked it, that trash can could&rsquo;ve lasted another two years. Waste is shameful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan arrogantly pointed at the trash can and said, "How much? I'll pay for it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cleaning lady sneered coldly, "Kid, </span><span>you really</span><span> look down on trash cans? You're way too arrogant. 250 dollars</span><span> for it</span><span>. I want you to bring back an identical one, or I'll call the cops."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan felt utterly helpless about a trash can being this expensive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "</span><span>G</span><span>ive you the money, buy it yourself." He definitely didn&rsquo;t have time to go trash can shopping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lady sneered, "Why should I? You broke</span><span> it</span><span>, you go buy it yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such bad manners. I'll take you. Don't even think about running away. </span><span>S</span><span>urveillance </span><span>all around</span><span>. You can't escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just looking at you</span><span>, I </span><span>can tell you&rsquo;ve got bad karma,</span><span> </span><span>People like you are</span><span> always be unlucky</span><span>. Always </span><span>getting hurt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan&rsquo;s jaw clenched.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously? Was this </span><span style="font-style: italic;">my</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> life now?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He </span><span>shot her a glare</span><span>, then shrugged it off, </span><span>and muttered, </span><span>"</span><span>Right. Psychic janitor. Great.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Where do </span><span>I get</span><span> the trash can?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cleaning lady said, "The supermarket</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>ast side of the city. A</span><span>nd</span><span> you'll need a car to bring it back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan hadn&rsquo;t expected that a trash can would </span><span>take a whole damn trip across the town</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan felt like he was falling apart inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to avoid ending up at the police station, he had no choice but to buy the trash can.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Queenie's office, George held Queenie tightly and said, "Queenie, my dad's back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie knew Andrew had left to figure out a way to deal with Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She kissed George on the cheek and said, "George, I know Andrew's planning to take action. </span><span>Any preparation in </span><span>advance?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George said, "No need. He's got everything planned. This time, Diana won't get away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie thought, "As long as Diana is dead, the Gellar Group will be back in our hands. With the Farley Group, I'll be unstoppable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George noticed her cunning expression and kissed her lips. He loved a woman with ambition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at his handsome face. If only he wouldn't betray her, she could have loved him forever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George was her ideal husband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, he liked sweet and obedient girls.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie molded herself to his preferences&mdash;gentle and considerate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Young girls might often turn themselves into someone they're not, all because of a man's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They</span><span> need a few lessons to grow up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, what are you thinking about? The way you're looking at me... you're gonna make me blush."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George's voice betrayed his desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie replied, "</span><span>T</span><span>hinking about</span><span>&hellip;</span><span> you! The younger you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George paused for a moment, his mind drifting back to his younger self&mdash;lonely and fragile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>here was someone in this world who looked exactly like him&mdash;Steven</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George had always lived in Steven's shadow, </span><span>copying his every move, every word, every little habit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He</span><span> thought </span><span>with </span><span>the car accident, he could finally take Steven's place. But Steven didn&rsquo;t die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saved</span><span> him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And just like that, George was shoved back into the dark&mdash;watching, waiting, pretending&mdash;for another three years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now&hellip; things were different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he could finally live in the light.</span><span> And he wasn&rsquo;t about to let anyone take that from him again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled. "Don&rsquo;t </span><span>dwell on the past.</span><span> Back then, life wasn&rsquo;t kind to either of us. The only warmth we had </span><span>&hellip;</span><span>was leaning on each other."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George looked at her intently and said, "Queenie, I mean it. Maybe I wavered before, but I promise</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>I love you, I only love you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie believed George had loved her, but if he gained control of the Gellar Group, his love might become worthless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and replied, "George, I believe you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was willing to trust him one more time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George smiled and leaned down, capturing her lips in a kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stepped out of the meeting room and immediately received a message from Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Diana, Andrew's flight landed. He went back to his place and hasn&rsquo;t come out since.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a bit puzzled. His calm</span><span>ness </span><span>surely meant he was plotting something. That was just so like Andrew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Luna, "Luna, have Barry keep an eye on Andrew. Whatever he does, </span><span>tell me</span><span> immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had a bad feeling. Andrew would never give up that easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Gellar Group was the one thing he wanted most in his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought, "Steven really handed me a huge problem. If we don&rsquo;t work well together,</span><span> </span><span>definitely be at risk."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna said, "Got it! I&rsquo;ll call him right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned, a constant sense of unease lingering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana heard someone call her name and saw it was Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He </span><span>wore</span><span> a black trench coat, and it fit him perfectly. Diana rarely saw him in a coat like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked incredibly handsome&mdash;no actor on TV could match his charisma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Alexander, back from your trip."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at her gently, "Yeah! I came to see you as soon as I got back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Guess </span><span>what</span><span> I brought for you, yeah! C</span><span>hocolate cake. </span><span>Your favorite.</span><span>" Alexander said, his eyes lingering on her still sitting in the wheelchair. It made his heart ache.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana reached out for the cake and smiled, "</span><span>You're bribing me with sugar? Fine -</span><span>Dinner's on me tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Exactly the invitation he'd hoped for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at her smiling face and thought she was so pure, so adorable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "</span><span>Come on, I've got news. </span><span>Some progress in t</span><span>he therapy support system</span><span>.</span><span> Three months to launch.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded and said, "</span><span>Perfect timing! </span><span>Alright! Diana, I</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ve also got </span><span>something to tell you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1047.html">« Prev</a><a href="1049.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
