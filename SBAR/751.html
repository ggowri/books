It is obvious that he cares about her," Owen thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Yvette reached out to hold Steven's arm and said in a flirty voice, "Mr. Gellar, didn't we agree to go to the hotel to sign the contract?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven heard that, his cold eyes narrowed slightly, and his voice was icy and ruthless. "Ms. King, are you so eager to climb into my bed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a piercing aura emanated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette shuddered all over, feeling a little afraid of Steven, and a chill ran down her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suppressed her anger and asked in a low voice, "Mr. Gellar, what do you mean by that? When we came here just now, you clearly promised me that in the elevator!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, don't forget that we haven't signed the contract yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven stopped in his tracks, his eyes showing strong disgust. "I'm not interested in cooperating with you, but Owen is."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen couldn't take his eyes off Yvette's breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette was startled. She had been coveting Steven's body. His strong physique made him masculine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their circle, rich women had many men around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With money came freedom. The men around many of Yvette's good friends were elites.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvette was determined to get Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Steven was not interested in her beauty at all, and she even lost the chance to cooperate with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was quite surprised. Yvette had slept with him before just to get him to act as a go-between. He thought that today's cooperation was a sure thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and asked, "Steven, what's wrong with you? Are you annoyed? Didn't you agree to the cooperation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the only reason Owen could think of. The scene just now irritated Steven. Diana was still his woman, so it was really an eyesore to see her hugging another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at Owen calmly and said, "Owen, you are just a playboy. All you want is sex and money. Can you do business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's voice was cold, but at that moment, his calm expression exuded an irresistible aura, and he was like an emperor dominating the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's mood changed completely. There was still a faint smile on his handsome face, but his fingers exerted a little force. "Steven, are you looking down on me? We've been good friends for many years, and you actually talked to me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Steven snorted, but Owen ignored what he had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said Diana was fickle, but you yourself are no better!" Steven thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan, let's go." Steven strode towards the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan looked at Owen and said with a smile, "I'm sorry, Mr. Toby, Mr. Gellar is not in a good mood today. Let's talk about the contract next time. We're leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan laughed happily and wanted to applaud looking at Owen's pale face. Only Steven could make that playboy livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen glanced at Evan coldly and thought, "Evan has changed, and so has Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Yvette was seething. "Owen, why was Steven like that? All I did was invite him to a hotel to sign the contract. Why was he annoyed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen looked at her with a cold and oppressive look in his eyes. "Yvette, don't I know your character? Do you really just want to sign the contract and have no other intentions?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="750.html">« Prev</a><a href="752.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
