Spotting the police close by, he left it at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he added, "I'll go talk to your dad first." With that, he got into his car and drove off, leaving Samuel to be taken into the police car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Queenie and George watched the whole scene unfold. Her eyes gleamed with a sharp, unmistakable hostility as she thought, "In my dreams, Cecil would have been dead by now. Why is he still alive? Could reincarnation exist? If it does, then everything in my dreams must have happened once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes turned icy cold as she sat quietly in the passenger seat. Over the past few days, she seemed like a completely different person, an alluring mix of pride and elegance, drawing attention without even trying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George glanced at Queenie's glowing presence out of the corner of his eye, finding her increasingly captivating these days. He thought that her entire being had transformed into something truly remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He broke the silence, saying, "Queenie, let's head to Wyatt's company now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gave a slight nod. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If everything in the dream was real, then George betrayed me again, and I forced him to end his life in front of Diana's grave. But why would he betray me? And if the dream was real, why isn't anything turning out the same?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her dreams, Queenie had claimed the entire Farley family for herself. With their support and Steven's love, she had dominated the business world, becoming an </span><span>unstoppable queen of commerce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie vividly recalled a particular scene from her dream, she had stolen Diana's life, emerging as the ultimate victor. She had taken Diana's original designs and framed her as a plagiarist, forever tarnishing Diana's reputation. Yet, despite it all, Steven continued to adore and cherish her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, one day, everything unraveled. Steven discovered the truth&mdash;about George, about Diana saving his life. His love and devotion to Queenie vanished overnight, replaced by an unwavering loyalty to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie remembered that Diana had become pregnant then. To protect Diana, Steven even locked her away, allowing no one to be near her. But by then, it was already too late. Queenie and George had already infiltrated the heart of Steven's company, destroying it from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wondered, "How exactly did Steven die?" Her dreams were a chaotic mess, and she had to piece together the truth bit by bit. She could still remember clearly that Diana had been pushed down the stairs by George, losing her life and her unborn child in one tragic moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze hardened as she reflected, "All of this feels like something that truly happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was George, sitting beside her. Queenie dared not think too deeply about their relationship. They had been in love. Of that, she was certain. With the guidance of her dreams, she felt confident she could still ascend to the pinnacle of success, becoming the queen she was destined to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's confident smile returned as she thought, "It doesn't matter who Diana is. In this life, she'll always be beneath me. Even without Steven's help, I'll achieve my dreams on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They soon arrived outside Wyatt's company building. Queenie and George got out of the car swiftly and headed straight for Wyatt's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt, unaware of what his son had done, was currently preparing for the morning meeting at the company. When he saw Queenie and George walk in, he looked a little surprised but quickly greeted them with a warm smile. "Ms. Marsh, Mr. Gellar, what brings you here so suddenly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt assumed she was here to deliver a business contract, as she often did personally in their previous collaborations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gave a calm, almost casual smile. "Oh, I'm just here to watch you make a fool of yourself, Mr. Wyatt Farley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile on Wyatt's face froze instantly. "What's that supposed to mean, Ms. Marsh? It's early in the morning&mdash;let's not joke around. What kind of 'foolishness' do you think I'd have to show you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's smile deepened, carrying a hint of sharpness. "Well, I came to watch how you've hit rock bottom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was completely taken aback. He studied her expression and realized she wasn't joking. His face darkened as he said firmly, "That's not funny at all, Ms. Marsh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled faintly, her bright eyes sparkling like clear water, captivating and full of hidden meaning. "Oh, haven't you heard? Your son was arrested for murder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Wyatt's face turned pale as the blood drained from it. His son&mdash;his only son&mdash;couldn't possibly be in trouble. He questioned, "What are you talking about? My son may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but he would never commit murder. You can't just throw accusations around like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie clicked her tongue, unimpressed by his disbelief. She pulled out her phone and played a video. "See for yourself, then. Your son was taken away by the police just a few minutes ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt stared at the screen, his son's disheveled face appearing in the footage as officers escorted him into a police car. His expression collapsed as he stumbled back, almost losing his footing. "No... this can't be true. My son... he wouldn't do something like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept shaking his head, refusing to believe his son could have done something as terrible as murder. He knew that even if his son were capable of it, he'd do it in secret&mdash;not so brazenly and out in the open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's patience was wearing thin, and a hint of anger flickered in her eyes. "You've seen it with your own eyes. Are you in denial, or do you just not dare to believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt roared, "I don't believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it hit Wyatt&mdash;he suddenly remembered the incident with Jace's family. The whole circle had been buzzing about how Queenie had schemed against them. Wyatt froze for a moment, a sharp realization cutting through his thoughts. His face twisted with anger as he pointed at her accusingly. "Did you set up my son too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head with a faint smile. "Oh, come on. With your son's impulsive personality, do you think I'd need to set him up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie added, "After Diana framed him, he couldn't wait to get out of prison and go after her for revenge. No one could stop him." Her tone was casual, almost carefree, and her grin only deepened with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's face darkened with understanding. He jabbed a finger at her again, his voice trembling with rage. "Queenie, it was you. You provoked my son into going after Diana, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't seem interested in confirming or denying his accusation. "I get that this is a hard pill for you to swallow. But the fact remains&mdash;your son's actions have already been exposed. The news is out, and your company's stock will be plummeting soon. Instead of clinging to it, why not sell the company to me at a discount? Then, you can focus on your son's legal defense. Maybe you'll even save his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words had barely settled when Brian's panicked voice echoed from the doorway. "Bad news, Mr. Wyatt Farley! Mr. Samuel Farley's been arrested again. He's trending online&mdash;everyone's saying he's a murderer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt was completely stunned. He whipped his head toward Queenie, who was grinning ear to ear. It finally dawned on him&mdash;this was all part of her plan. Every bit of it. His voice shook as he spat, "I see it now, Queenie. This was all your doing. From the start, you never intended to work with me. Your real target was the Farley family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft..." Queenie couldn't help but burst into laughter, her mocking gaze fixed on Wyatt's furious face. "Come on, let's not twist the story, Mr. Wyatt Farley. You're </span><span>accusing me of scheming against you and your family. Do you have any proof to back that up?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="936.html">« Prev</a><a href="938.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
