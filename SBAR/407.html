That puts my mind at ease. You're more straightforward than Queenie; at least you wouldn't do anything to us out here on the open sea. If Queenie were here, we should have headed back," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and asked, "Are you really that afraid of her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil laughed in anger, "How could I not be afraid? Your dream lover is a venomous snake. You two are truly a perfect match. I wish you both eternal happiness and a long life together, but please, don't harm any more innocent people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was furious. "How ..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil stuck out his tongue at him and turned to take the lobster to the boat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned; it turned out that Diana's danger last night was indeed because of Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Why does she have to kill Diana? Just because she wants to marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven saw that Diana had already caught a stone bass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was dragging the fish ashore. Diana was very familiar with diving; in the water, her swimming movements were minimal, like a joyful little fish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven jumped into the water and swam over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana spat out a mouthful of seawater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she saw a magnified handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, you scared me!" Diana, seeing Steven appear suddenly, quickly retreated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana, seeing his arm wrapped in gauze, frowned and said, "Steven, what are you doing? Your arm is still injured. What were you thinking of jumping down here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had no idea of how to take care of himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled. "You still care about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana laughed in exasperation, "Steven, I've gone to great lengths to save you so many times. You nearly died in a fire, and then almost got hit by a car. I was almost eaten by a pack of wolves too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, but I won't waste my time saving you again if anything like that happens to you." Diana glared at him fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled, his hair wet from the seawater, making him look even more handsome. He had a beautiful smile. "Diana, give me that fish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said with displeasure, "No. Why should I give you the fish I caught?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven raised his eyebrows and said, "I'll give you money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled brightly and charmingly. "Alright! This fish costs ten thousand dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven smiled and said, "Deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought Steven had a masochistic tendency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Knowing he was wealthy, she handed the fish over to him. "Wait here, I'll go catch more. I'm going to make a million dollars today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana threw the fish at him and then turned to swim deeper into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahh... Diana, help! There's a super big moray eel chasing me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was screaming frantically as she ran towards where Cecil was, still holding a fish she had just caught.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="406.html">« Prev</a><a href="408.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
