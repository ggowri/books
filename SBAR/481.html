I will explain it to Helen and tell her that I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pretended to be deaf and walked into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren, the butler, was waiting for Diana at the door. Seeing Steven, he said with a gloomy face, "Ms. Bishop, why is your ex here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Diana almost laughed out loud. With Steven's personality, she knew that he would not leave tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked unhappy. "I'm not her ex."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren ignored him and thought, "Just wait another year, and Diana can get a divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled at Daren, "Daren, it's too late. Go back and rest. I'm fine. I'll have my family doctor come over to give me an IV drip tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that Daren was worried about her, so he stood at the door waiting for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren and Rhea both cared about Diana so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana treated them as her family and didn't want them to worry about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren glanced at Steven, looking worried. "Ms. Bishop, he..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "It's okay. He'll leave soon. Go and rest, Daren."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daren gave Steven a warning look and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned and thought, "Am I so unpopular?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana opened the door and went into the living room, and Steven followed her in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time that Steven came to Diana's house. The villa was decorated very warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge spiral staircase in the villa was so eye-catching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, emitting a brilliant and charming light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The decoration of the villa was a perfect fusion of low-key and luxury. There were no flashy colors and decorations, but unparalleled quality and style were revealed in every detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at Diana's back, feeling guilty. Compared to this villa, the villa they had lived in before was really terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven walked over, sat next to Diana, and made a video call to Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video call was quickly connected. Helen smiled lovingly, "Hey, Steven. Did you take good care of Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven pointed the camera at Diana. "Yes, Grandma. I didn't lie to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana greeted Helen with a smile. "I'm fine, Helen. I'll be fine after two days of rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was worried about Diana. "Diana, why did you go to the viaduct? I'm very distressed to see you injured, so I asked Steven to take care of you. He is actually very caring. I'm worried that he is not by your side to take care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Helen's concern, Diana felt warm. "Helen, I have Rhea to take care of me at home. Steven doesn't need to stay here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen said, "Steven is your husband. You two can't be separated for too long. Let Steven take care of you tonight. You took care of him for two years. Now that you are injured, it is his turn to take care of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's settled. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. I'll call you tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen smiled and then hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "Helen still wants to bring Steven and me together, but I really want to divorce Steven. Is Helen's previous promise that she agreed with my wish to divorce Steven an excuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Helen's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that there were not many people who were really kind to her, so Diana valued Helen's kindness and warmth to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at the tired Diana and said, "It's Grandma's orders. I have to obey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless. "Now that Helen has seen you here, she will be relieved. Now, you can go."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="480.html">« Prev</a><a href="482.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
