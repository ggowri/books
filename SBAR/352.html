You only waited an hour, and you can't stand it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His tone was very indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Steven was a child, he waited for Andrew many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To accompany his mistress and his illegitimate children, Andrew neglected Steven and Jenny. At that time, Steven was waiting for Andrew to come back every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was naive and thought that if he behaved well and studied hard, Andrew would come back to see him, but he was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gradually, Steven understood that Andrew would never come back. His parents were in a marriage arranged by their families. Jenny was beautiful and came from a scholarly family, and she had always been aloof. Andrew didn't come back, but she wouldn't fight and just wanted to live her own life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Steven longed for his father's love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew knocked on the table, bringing Steven back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew knew that he had no feelings for Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Edward was only willing to give the management rights to Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph, you are disrespectful. I am your father, and you want me to wait for you?" Andrew was very angry. "If Queenie hadn't been there to chat with me, I would have left long ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven raised his eyebrows and smiled, and his smile was very intimidating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you can go. I don't have to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Andrew's face turned red with anger, and his eyes became bloodshot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Andrew Gellar, calm down. Steven has been very busy recently. You two haven't seen each other for a long time. You should have a good chat. Stop being angry, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's voice was soft, which made Andrew look much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Andrew calmed down, Queenie asked the waiter to serve the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the food was served, Andrew asked Steven while eating, "I heard that you are not planning to divorce Diana that loser."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes turned cold. "It's not your business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I want to control you? I have tolerated this matter again and again. Before, she didn't want to divorce, but you wanted to divorce every day. Now she wants a divorce, but you are unwilling. What's wrong with you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana is jealous of Queenie and always frames her. She is a vicious woman. Divorce her so you can marry Queenie sooner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie has waited for you for so many years. How long do you want her to wait?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven looked at Queenie with a half-smile. "She is willing to do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie told the meaning "You deserve it." from Steven's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she had an illusion that she couldn't control Steven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was smiling, but he looked cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, are you trying to piss me off?" Andrew looked at Steven angrily. Steven had been very rebellious since he was a child. Apart from his grandparents, he would not listen to Andrew at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sneered and crossed his legs elegantly, looking noble and cold. "You are living well, aren't you? You have many illegitimate children. Yesterday, your illegitimate son even called to provoke me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since I met you today, please tell him that if he does that again, I don't mind feeding him to the sharks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You dare?" Andrew put down his fork in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bang..." The vegetable juice splashed all over Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was anger in her eyes, but she hid it well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven always made Andrew mad to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat there calmly. He didn't hold his fork but tapped the table lightly, looking lazy and indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew hated Steven's arrogant and stubborn look the most, which was as annoying as Jenny's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He liked gentle women, not talented women who were high and mighty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jenny was too aloof, and that was why she was admitted to a mental hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew looked at Queenie and said, "Queenie showed me a video in which Diana poisoned your mother and made her crazy. You still don't divorce her. Is there something wrong with your brain?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glanced at Queenie with cold eyes, making Queenie feel a chill on her back.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="351.html">« Prev</a><a href="353.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
