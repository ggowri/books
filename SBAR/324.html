They are incredibly large, and at that time, I was almost scared to death. Deep-sea diving is dangerous. After that, my brother never let me go to the deep sea again. Not to mention my brother, I was also terrified."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about it now still made Diana feel uneasy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea listened and felt that it sounded very dangerous.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana loaded all the seafood into the car and posted a photo grid on social media. The caption read: [Today's catch is amazing. Looking forward to my seafood feast. I saw a sea eel with thick legs, it scared me.] She added a scared emoji at the end.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[After setting the traps, I hope to get my favorite octopus tomorrow.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After posting, Diana changed her clothes and left with Althea to head back home.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had been waiting for four hours when he heard the notification from Diana's post.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly picked up his phone and saw that Diana had caught a lot of seafood, smiling with satisfaction.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's mood improved. Without him, she was living better and much happier.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat quietly, watching her post for a long while before returning to work.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Diana got back to Althea's house, she took a hot bath.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After drying her hair, she felt exhausted but refreshed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was steaming crabs in the kitchen, so Diana went in to help.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Althea, you go sit and rest, leave the rest to me. I've become quite good at it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea, feeling tired, gladly handed over the cooking.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Alright, alright, I'll just wait to enjoy the meal then."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She went out to rest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana cleaned a grouper fish and prepared it for steaming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she boiled her favorite shells.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At dinner, Diana and Althea ate happily together.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Althea couldn't eat crabs, Diana saved two of the three big crabs for a late-night snack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Diana washed the dishes, and then the two of them went out for a walk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking out at the distant ocean, Diana smiled and said, "Althea, did you know? I lived on an island for 16 years. After I turned 16, I went back to the countryside for a year, and when I was 17, I met Steven. That's when all the complications between us started."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea knew those were not great experiences. She said, "Diana, let's look forward. Let the past stay in the past."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and nodded. "Yes. It's beautiful here."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the day, the sea was calm and blue. She loved the ocean so much.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stayed there for three days, and during that time, she caught two tuna fish.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sent them to Alexander so he could enjoy some sashimi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, who had Steven's contact information, received the fish that same day. As soon as he got the fish, he posted on social media, showing off.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The caption read: [Tuna caught by Diana, along with a super big lobster. The coconut snail is so beautiful. So much love.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven happened to see Alexander's post when he was checking Diana's posts.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The words "so much love" annoyed him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had sent seafood to Alexander.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What is Alexander planning?</p><div class="pagination"><a href="323.html">« Prev</a><a href="325.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
