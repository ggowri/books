She was in a good mood, preparing to hold a party in the company to gain a reputation as a good president, but she saw Mario running in hurriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his hurried footsteps and pale face, Queenie suddenly had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could ask, Mario said anxiously, "Ms. Marsh, we acquired Paula's company, but it turned out to be an empty shell. All the technical staff left one after another within this month. Their contracts had expired. We were too anxious at the time and overlooked many things. Except for the building, the company is now empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those veterans had been working with Paula. After Paula left, all the people in the technical department left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for those customers who had previously agreed to sign contracts with us, after hearing that our technicians had left, they all canceled their contracts."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie was stunned. She widened her eyes in disbelief and staggered a few steps in anger, falling on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could it be like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't go to the company during this period because she didn't want to arouse anyone's suspicion, but she didn't expect that the company would become a shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She yelled angrily, "Where is Felicity? Didn't she try to keep those technicians? Those customers reached an agreement with us before. Why did they suddenly go back on their word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie didn't understand. Everything was out of control now, and she couldn't accept this result.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario couldn't understand it either. Everything was under control, but something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Those technicians promised us at first, saying they would come back to work after a few days of rest, but after they left, they went to other cities and were not willing to come back at all. I couldn't get through to them by phone, and their home addresses were all fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They didn't leave all at once. Instead, they left one after another every few days. Those who had agreed to cooperate with us canceled their contracts as soon as they heard that all the technical staff had left. Now the company has nothing left except that building.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those partners only care about their own interests and our previous promises. Now that we don't have the technical personnel, they are afraid of losing money, so they will no longer cooperate with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Queenie's distraught appearance, Mario felt distressed. All the money Queenie had earned in the past few years was used to acquire Paula's company, and now Steven wouldn't give her five million dollars every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she could only rely on a few other companies for support.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sat there blankly without speaking. She had not expected this to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her painful appearance, Mario continued, "Ms. Marsh, you were not at home these few days, and the stock market suddenly became very turbulent. The stock we bought fell to the bottom, but the stock that had fallen to the bottom before suddenly soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I went there, I saw Cecil was there too. He and Diana both bought stocks that had skyrocketed in price, and they both earned a lot. We lost all the money we invested in the stock market."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The double whammy made Queenie's body stagger. Feeling a hot current running through her lower body, she fainted from anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario ran over and shouted anxiously, "Ms. Marsh, wake up."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face looked pale. Eric, who was standing outside, saw this scene and smiled. He thought, "Queenie, you will suffer a lot this time."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="763.html">« Prev</a><a href="765.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
