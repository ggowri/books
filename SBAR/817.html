"Diana, you have to give me a chance to make things right, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head, a bitter smile twisting her features. "I gave you countless chances, Steven. Ninety-nine chances, to be exact. And you never once took them seriously. The Marsh family hurt me, badly, more than eighty times. But you hurt me ninety-nine times. So, tell me, why should I forgive you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven froze, clearly stunned that she'd kept such a precise tally for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had borne the brunt of his cruelty ninety-nine times until she could hold on no longer and had to let go. Only he knew the depth of the love she had once harbored for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of his momentary shock, Diana pushed him aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, he watched as she deftly sidestepped him, slipped on her shoes, and walked out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared after her, a sharp pang of regret twisting in his gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Ninety-nine times?" The sheer magnitude of the number sent a shiver cascading down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Diana, no matter what you think, from now on, we're in this together. For better or for worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his phone and called Evan, telling him to have a car ready to take him to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Diana found Luna waiting in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana slid into the passenger seat. Luna glanced at her. "I'll drop you at the station. Then, I'm going to pick up Mrs. Foliot. She's all set."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "Okay. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Luna drove towards the police station, Steven's car followed close behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat in the back, fixing his gaze on the passing scenery. His expression was grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The internet was ablaze with vitriol directed at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She texted Nolan, telling him not to intervene just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the right time. Amelie and Mark wanted a public spectacle, so Diana would give them one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arranging everything, Diana went to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the police station, Jean was almost unrecognizable and was swaddled in a pristine white down jacket. Her hair was drawn back into a severe bun, with her face further obscured by a mask and sunglasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Jean laid eyes on Diana, she marched towards Diana furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana! You killed my mother! They found your clothes and fingerprints at the scene!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the tinted lenses of her sunglasses, her gaze was venomous as she glared at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana met her furious gaze with a faint smile. "Ms. Foliot, please calm down. You know exactly how your mother died. You just don't want to admit it. You're being played, used as a pawn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean was rooted to the spot, stunned. She hadn't expected that even at this moment, Diana would still be so audacious and utter such harsh words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Jean sputtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana patted her shoulder condescendingly and smiled. "Honey, don't get your feathers ruffled. The real show's about to begin. You should pay close attention. You're a daughter with no conscience, no filial piety, who wishes her own mother dead and embraces the mistress. I wonder how that story ends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean gaped at her in shock. "What are you talking about? Used? Unfilial? Diana, you're a murderer! You have no right to say those things to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana remained silent, thinking that despite Jean's intelligence, she was still being manipulated. Amelie knew exactly how to pull people's strings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jean," Diana said softly, "between your mother and Amelie, who's the one truly hurting you? Deep down, you know. You craved freedom, so you resented your mother's discipline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you've found some safe haven where you can just enjoy your life now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelie was anything but a safe haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just the beginning of Jean's nightmare.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="816.html">« Prev</a><a href="818.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
