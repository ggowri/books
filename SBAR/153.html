He didn&#x27;t hear clearly what they talked about.</p><p>Steven was very angry.</p><p>It was horrible. Evan thought that he shouldn&#x27;t say anything.</p><p>Diana had just returned to the office when she received a strange phone call. She had already blocked all the people of the Marsh family. Diana guessed that it must be someone from the Marsh family.</p><p>When Diana answered the phone, she heard Jeff&#x27;s furious voice, &quot;Diana, come to the hospital quickly. Queenie has committed suicide because of you. Come and give her a blood transfusion.&quot;</p><p>Diana said angrily, &quot;Mr. Jeff Marsh, do you think she would dare to use my blood?&quot;</p><p>Jeff didn&#x27;t understand what Diana meant. He just wanted Diana to pay a heavy price and for Queenie to get married to Steven.</p><p>In this case, Jeff&#x27;s plan can go smoothly. Steven was his biggest cash cow.</p><p>&quot;What is there to be afraid of? It&#x27;s because of you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re talking nonsense. You bastard know the truth better than anyone. You can ask Queenie whether she dares to take my blood. If she does, I will spread the video of her and Harry sleeping together. She is the mistress who destroyed the relationship between me and Steven. Don&#x27;t you care about your reputation the most? If your precious daughter&#x27;s reputation is damaged, I&#x27;m afraid you might jump off the building in anger.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You, you, you... Diana, how dare you? How dare you call me bastard? I am your father.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you think you are worthy of being my father? You know better than anyone how I got lost?&quot;</p><p>Jeff was so angry that he couldn&#x27;t speak. He thought, &quot;Why would Diana say that? What did she know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up! You can&#x27;t even speak straight, and you still want my blood. Aren&#x27;t you afraid that I will take your life?&quot; Diana hung up the phone angrily.</p><p>Diana scolded, &quot;You bastard, disgusting!&quot;</p><p>Diana stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and looked at the scenery outside. Paula had not come to trouble her recently. She must have believed Diana&#x27;s words and had discovered the affair between Queenie and Jeff and the woman Jeff kept outside.</p><p>Queenie had an older brother. So, Jeff lied back then.</p><p>In Diana&#x27;s last life, Queenie also committed suicide. Because of her suicide and because Steven did not divorce Diana, this plan did not succeed. After a few months, Queenie would drug Steven.</p><p>And Diana would become a victim that night and have a child.</p><p>In this life, Diana would never let that happen.</p><p>She also would not bring her child into an incomplete home.</p><p>Whether she could make Steven divorce her depends on Queenie&#x27;s ability.</p><p>It was in the hospital.</p><p>Queenie lost too much blood and lay weakly on the bed.</p><p>Her eyes were cold. She thought, &quot;I had committed suicide. Steven should divorce Diana.</p><p>I can&#x27;t see what Steven is thinking now.</p><p>But I must get married to Steven.&quot;</p><p>Jeff walked in angrily and felt distressed when he saw Queenie&#x27;s weak appearance.</p><p>&quot;Queenie, Diana is outrageous. She won&#x27;t come to the hospital to give you a blood transfusion. She said that if she wants to give you a blood transfusion, she would release the video of you and Harry sleeping together, as well as your relationship with Steven. Don&#x27;t you think she is just talking nonsense?</p><p>&quot;I have called your eldest brother and asked him to bring Diana over to apologize to you.&quot;</p><p>Queenie&#x27;s face turned pale. In the past, the things she did to Diana actually backfired on her.</p><p>Her original intention was to stimulate Diana to leave Steven.</p><p>Diana left, but Steven was unwilling to let go.</p><p>Queenie thought, &quot;I only slept with Harry once.</p><p>How does Diana get the video?&quot;</p><p>Queenie was stunned for a moment, remembering Harry&#x27;s habit. She was so angry. It was Harry. He had the habit of recording.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="152.html">« Prev</a><a href="154.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
