The mere thought of Queenie filled her with seething anger. "Queenie wants our company&rsquo;s secrets, doesn&rsquo;t she? </span><span>S</span><span>et a trap for her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric, visibly excited, said, "I&rsquo;ll call Dylan right away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Dylan was at a restaurant, having dinner with his four close friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, you&rsquo;re not leaving again, right?" Enzo Raimi asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan shook his head, "I&rsquo;m not leaving. Life abroad was boring anyway. Once the rally ended, I quit. From now on, make sure you all live a good life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Enzo and the others immediately broke into wide grins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Dylan's phone rang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at the caller ID&mdash;it was Eric.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sly smile crept onto his face</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looks like they finally couldn&rsquo;t hold back. </span><span>Paula</span><span>&rsquo;s way too soft-hearted. There&rsquo;s no way she&rsquo;d ignore her own son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, as long as I stir up trouble, </span><span>Paula</span><span> feels embarrassed. She&rsquo;ll always handle me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, Eric." Dylan answered the call lazily, propping one foot arrogantly on the stool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few of his friends were drinking and chatting nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric's voice came through the phone. "Dylan, let's meet up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan seized the opportunity. "Alright. Let&rsquo;s meet at your office then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the perfect chance to find out the company&rsquo;s location.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric hadn&rsquo;t expected Dylan to be this eager.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It hurt. In a low voice, he said, "Alright, send you the address."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hanging up the phone, Dylan felt pleased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his phone at his friends. </span><span>"</span><span>The Marsh family&rsquo;s lost its shine, but Mom&rsquo;s still loaded. I&rsquo;m heading to my brother&rsquo;s company now. That girl in the photo? Diana&mdash;my </span><span>&lsquo;lovely&rsquo; sister. Always making my life hell. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve got your expenses covered.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His friends lit up instantly, grinning from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan, we&rsquo;re all on your side! We know Diana. Just wait, we&rsquo;ll bring you some good news!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man in a floral shirt gave a knowing, sly smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan caught his meaning, narrowing his eyes. "She&rsquo;s still my sister, so don&rsquo;t get her pregnant. But since she&rsquo;s made mistakes, she deserves to be punished."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he added, "Make sure to take pictures. She looks pretty good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wicked grin filled Dylan's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha&hellip;"</span><span> </span><span>His close friends burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's face twisted with malice as he thought, "Diana, since you ruined my family, I&rsquo;ll ruin you. I&rsquo;ll make you wish you were dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Steven&rsquo;s money, he could at least take half of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Paula&rsquo;s money, he figured most of it would be his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan downed a glass of whiskey and got up to find Eric.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula chose the new office location in a building right behind Diana&rsquo;s company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She deliberately moved here just to be closer to her daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had carefully considered this location for a long time. Office buildings in this area were already scarce.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t until a company finally went bankrupt and moved out that she snagged the right floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She even hired a fortune teller to check the place&mdash;it was deemed great for the company&rsquo;s growth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan arrived at the address, walked straight into the building, and took the elevator up to the sixteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire floor belonged to Paula's company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Dylan pushed the door open, Eric was already waiting for him in the office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan glanced around, curling his lip in disdain. "Eric, with our family's resources, you could&rsquo;ve bought the whole building, right? This office is way too shabby."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric's eyes darkened as he watched Dylan sit on the sofa and prop his feet up on the coffee table.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "If you're so capable, go buy yourself. I can only afford one floor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan let out a cold laugh. "Eric, spare me the complaints. </span><span>Paula</span><span> </span><span>already told Queenie that her assets are still intact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric let out a helpless laugh. "Dylan, do you believe everything people tell you? If she told you to drop dead, would you do it too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan suddenly shot up, pointing a finger at his nose. "Eric, what&rsquo;s that supposed to mean? Queenie&rsquo;s the princess. How could a bumpkin like Diana even compare to her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric frowned deeply. "Dylan, you have no idea what&rsquo;s been going on while you were abroad. Let me tell you, Diana isn&rsquo;t..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan didn&rsquo;t want to hear it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly cut him off, "I don&rsquo;t care who she is. </span><span>She made</span><span> our family apart. If she hadn&rsquo;t come back, we&rsquo;d still be living happily together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric froze for a moment</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dylan is absolutely unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a cold laugh. "Dylan, </span><span>Paula</span><span> </span><span>thought you might change, she sent me to talk to you. But now, it seems you wouldn&rsquo;t be missed if you dropped dead young."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eric, what do you mean? Are you cursing me to die?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;m not cursing you. After Queenie and Steven use you, you</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll</span><span> </span><span>be</span><span> their scapegoat. Since you&rsquo;re so eager to </span><span>come back</span><span>, I&rsquo;ll arrange a position. </span><span>A</span><span> few big international projects </span><span>com</span><span>e</span><span> </span><span>up for signing. If you can close just one deal, a quarter of assets will be yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really?" Dylan&rsquo;s eyes lit up at the mention of money. The flicker of unease in his heart was instantly drowned by his greed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching him so excited, Eric found it laughable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was right, he thought. Dylan was selfish, only caring about money, with no sense of family at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course." Eric sneered inwardly. "I have to give him a chance to mess up. And Queenie too&mdash;she deserves her shot at failure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow, that&rsquo;s great! Eric, I knew you hadn&rsquo;t forgotten me. So, where&rsquo;s my office?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric pointed to the office next door. "Right there, next to mine," he said. "</span><span>A</span><span>lso assigned you an assistant. </span><span>C</span><span>lient files to be signed. Some need renewals, and you&rsquo;ll have to schedule meetings with them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan instantly felt it was too complicated. For the past twenty years, Paula had always given him money, he had no interest in working.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All he wanted was to enjoy life without lifting a finger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t want to go through any hardships. Meeting clients meant attending social events, and difficult clients might even give him a hard time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was definitely not the kind of life he wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eric, I&rsquo;m your brother! Why are you making me do this? Just assign me a capable project manager..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric suddenly pointed to the door, "If that&rsquo;s your attitude, leave now. We don&rsquo;t need lazy </span><span>guys</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words left Dylan feeling indignant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used to believe that as long as he had money, he could do whatever he wanted. But now, he suddenly realized that tomorrow or the unexpected could arrive at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instantly grew frustrated, snatched the documents angrily, and said, "Fine! Great! Just wait and see. I&rsquo;ll take back every bit, not leaving you a single cent!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1060.html">« Prev</a><a href="1062.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
