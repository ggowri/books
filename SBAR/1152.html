Let's see how you behave in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her radiant smile and smiled as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, she had already forgiven him in her heart, but she was unwilling to admit it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he knew he would wait for that day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil looked at Steven and Diana, smiled, and said, "Stop. It's still early. Want to grab a midnight snack together?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Cecil and Olivia, always feeling there was something subtle about their relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil spent three hundred million dollars on a necklace for Olivia. Cecil rarely treats a woman like this. If Cecil falls in love with someone, he will be very sincere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia is always indifferent, only smiling happily in front of Diana because she has a strained relationship with her family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia is also a girl lacking love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil has a great character. Diana thinks maybe they really will end up together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hopes Olivia can be happy and joyful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded and said, "Sure. Olivia, let's go together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia said, "Sure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Alright, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at them leaving with displeasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her schemes were meticulously planned, yet she still lost to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn Steven, how could he do this to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's change in attitude was unacceptable to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven with deep affection just now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana is actually very smart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And around Diana now are people who genuinely care for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Queenie is gradually losing everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That feeling filled her with panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Mario also left. On the way, neither of them said a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario knew Queenie was angry, so he stayed silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie felt uneasy inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This unease made her very scared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mario, I feel terrible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie pressed her hand against her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario pulled over to the side of the road, gently patted her back, and said, "Queenie, don't be sad. You still have me. Our overseas project will start making money soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie also hoped to expand the company overseas. It had always been her dream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her dream was about to come true, yet she felt unreal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mario, we will succeed, won't we?" she said, tears in her eyes as she looked at Mario.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario lowered his head and kissed her trembling lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two began biting each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie felt pain and slightly pulled away from Mario's lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario's breath brought her back to her senses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slowly leaned back in the seat, smiled, and picked up her phone to send a message to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very happy tonight. While Steven was driving, she carefully admired the diamond necklace in her hand. It was truly beautiful and perfect for pairing with a gown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, her phone vibrated. She put the necklace back and picked up her phone to check the message.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment she saw the message, she froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's tall image collapsed in her heart at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Diana, did you think it was my arrangement that you drank an aphrodisiac at the party that night? It was all with Alexander's consent. He wanted you. Alexander doesn't truly love you.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Diana, not everyone loves you. The Alexander you once trusted the most has improper intentions toward you. This time he failed, but next time he will surely succeed.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's good impression of Alexander vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie's words aren't necessarily true.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly replied: [Queenie, although Alexander had such thoughts, the one who did it was you. The most vicious person has always been you.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Alexander won't do such things again. He's different from you. Everything he has didn't come easy. He cherishes everything he owns. He knows opportunities might only come once.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[But you are vain and care a lot about your pride. You think you're remarkable, yet you do despicable things. You're very contradictory.]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana has known Alexander for over a year and understands his character.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knows how to weigh the pros and cons; if he fails once, he won't risk a second time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt very happy after sending the message.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander has feelings for her, which she didn't expect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven noticed her unusual behavior and asked, "Diana, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head and said, "It's nothing. I just got a spam message."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt she was hiding something from him, but since she wouldn't say, he decided to investigate on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They soon arrived at the restaurant. Cecil and Olivia were already there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven parked the car, then got out with Diana and walked over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There weren't many people in the restaurant after 10 p.m.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This restaurant specializes in seafood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil and Olivia were already picking the food they liked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil saw them coming and smiled, saying, "Diana, Mr. Gellar, what would you like to eat?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I want squid and beef."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This restaurant has a wide variety of ingredients.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia helped her order, then looked at Steven and asked, "What about you, Mr. Gellar?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at the menu and finally chose shrimp.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil smiled and said, "Mr. Gellar, you can order some special dishes. This restaurant has a variety of ingredients."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil thought it was a good opportunity to try something different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil said, "The food here is excellent. Olivia and I are here for the third time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana curiously looked at Olivia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Olivia shyly lowered her head, avoiding Diana's meaningful gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't know her destiny. She had no idea about her love life, yet she looked forward to it even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at the menu again and asked, "You've been here three times, so you should know the specialties. What's good here?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1151.html">« Prev</a><a href="1153.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
