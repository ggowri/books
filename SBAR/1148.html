He chose a pink dress for her, which suited her hairstyle perfectly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven handed her the clothes and said, "Diana, wear this tonight. It's a bit chilly in the evening, so this long-sleeved outfit will be better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saw his gentle demeanor and couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! I'll listen to you." Diana felt she had no resolve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was truly happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt as if her long-held wish had come true. That joy radiated from the depths of her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, took the dress, and went to change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pink long dress made her look pure and beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven knew she would look stunning in that dress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked over, took Diana's hand, and gently said, "Let's go, my dear."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana no longer felt sleepy at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's gentle words sometimes made her feel like dreaming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boy who suddenly entered her world in her dreams is now her husband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there weren't many beautiful memories between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until she sat in the passenger seat and Steven started the car to leave the garage that Diana came back to her senses, looking at Steven driving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked gentle, different from his usual cold expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt her gaze and smiled, "Diana, I like the way you look at me, so focused."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly looked away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't." Diana denied it, not expecting him to notice her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her evasive gaze and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the car window, the sun was about to set.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at the sunset. It was beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked out the window and said, "I loved you so much back then. Wherever you were, I would always pay attention."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, can I never escape you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana still doesn't dare to gamble with her true feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven domineeringly said, "Diana, as long as you understand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless and gave Steven a glare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven just smiled. He had never been this happy in days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't be mad. If you're upset in the future, just hit me until you feel better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "I'm not a shrew."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned and said, "I mean if you're upset, you can hit me or scold me until you feel better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't understand why he would think that way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I'm not an unreasonable person. When I was sad or upset before, I would go back to the place we share and sort out my emotions. I never brought my bad mood to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said what he did earlier precisely because he knew her personality.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would rather she express her emotions and vent her anger at him than force herself to smile at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "I know, but we are husband and wife. I hope you can share any troubles with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the past, our relationship wasn't good, and I didn't even have a chance to explain. Now that we're together, you can talk to me about everything in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't you always say that life is full of conflicts and troubles?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That year we lived together, I truly felt happiness. But at that time, I was living in darkness and didn't dare to drag you, who lived in the sunlight, into the abyss."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned, finally realizing that this was what he had been thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that time, she was willing to fall into the abyss with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana just hadn't expected that he didn't want to pull her into the abyss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She loved him, but it had to be Steven's willingness. She blamed everything on Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The goodness she forced upon Steven might not have been what he wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Steven with a bitter smile and said, "Steven, turns out neither of us knows how to love someone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't know each other's thoughts without having an open-hearted conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She only knew her own unbearable pain in love but forgot Steven's situation and what he felt inside. Her love, he didn't dare to accept!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Diana's words, Steven had already parked the car at the entrance of Capitole Hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held Diana's hand, smiled at her, and said, "Diana, we will learn how to love each other."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled, "Let's go, I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven saw that she was in a much better mood, and he smiled too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the sunset, they walked into Capitole Hotel side by side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had dinner and then went to the auction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hadn't been to the auction house for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She always does charity in a practical way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This auction featured Faelandir's top-tier sapphire necklace, named Stellar Love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana wasn't really interested in it; she just hadn't been to the auction house in a long time and wanted to take a look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She already had plenty of jewelry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned around and saw it was Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's face was pale. She walked hunched over, as if she had lost a lot of weight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was surprised that Queenie still came to the auction house in such a state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana then remembered to ask Steven, "Who set us up last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at Queenie indifferently and said, "It was her! But we have no evidence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie rarely leaves evidence when she does things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Queenie and smiled, "Queenie, thank you for helping us last night. We became a real couple."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's face turned pale. She thought Alexander was useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She prepared everything for him, but he just stood by and did nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sneered and said, "Diana, it's embarrassing that you only slept together after three years of marriage."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1147.html">« Prev</a><a href="1149.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
