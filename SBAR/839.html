"Why didn't that fire take him out? Why didn't that car crash finish the job?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How come he's been saved twice by Diana? That bastard, how does he keep getting so lucky? And that woman&mdash;how does she always end up rescuing him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh..." Queenie screamed in frustration, feeling the weight of her despair crash down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she picked up her phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, why are you calling me again?" George's voice was laced with irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was already fuming, but George's words only stoked the fire. "George, didn't you say you'd found someone to seduce Steven? What's taking so long? He doesn't trust me anymore! and he's already repaid his debt to me for saving his life. He's no longer looking out for me. You need to come back and find a way to take him out. The entire Gellar family could be ours. Besides, Uncle is backing you up from the shadows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, I know you're struggling and feeling down, but this isn't the right moment. Steven has several big projects going on overseas, and they're all running smoothly. We need to wait until he cashes in; that'll be our golden opportunity. Once we're ready, I'll have people lined up to take him down, and then I can marry you without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just bear with me a little longer. Since he doesn't trust you anymore, go after his biggest rival. You don't need me to tell you how to handle that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury sparked in Queenie's eyes. "I'm doing all of this for you! Do you really intend to marry me?" That was her biggest insecurity. No matter how many times George promised, she couldn't shake the feeling of uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you're the love of my life. Who else would I marry? I swear I'll make it happen. Just get some rest. I'll take care of everything else; I've got a crucial deal to finalize right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he hung up, leaving her in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie squeezed her eyes shut, overwhelmed by a wave of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt utterly alone, and all of it stemmed from Diana's meddling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew, and soon, it was the day of the fashion designer competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana woke up early, bustling around the kitchen to prepare breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven came downstairs, he was greeted by the sight of a steaming plate of pasta topped with a perfectly fried egg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sat down, he looked at her and asked, "After today, I'll have a lot freer time. With Christmas around the corner, is there anything you want to buy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "Not really. I'm not spending Christmas with you, so if you want something, go ahead and get it yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned, his brow furrowing as he studied her serious expression. He tightened his grip on the fork. "Not spending Christmas with me? Who are you celebrating with? Your grandfather isn't back yet, is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "I'll be spending it with Luna. She's an orphan, and since my grandfather is away this year, we're going to celebrate together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, she thought, "As for Steven, he can do whatever he likes. It's really none of my business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And about his mother... well, if he doesn't care, why should I?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="838.html">« Prev</a><a href="840.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
