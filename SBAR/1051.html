You'll know when the time comes. By the way, did you get in touch with </span><span>Paula</span><span>? Are they willing to let you go back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Dylan with a feigned look of concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula moved out. Looks like she doesn't want to keep pretending anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was upset. He frowned. Paula hadn&rsquo;t even told him about moving out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was completely out of options.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula can't do this to me. How could she just abandon me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan shook his head. "Not yet! Queenie, don't worry. When I see them, I'll beg them to take me back. We share the same goal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie gave him a mocking look, thinking he was such a loser.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can't even find out where Paula is. There's no way he'll get the business secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I need to find someone else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "Dylan, I have an idea. Why don't you call the cops? If you report it, Paula will show up. Diana's the CEO now. If the news </span><span>reveals the truth</span><span>, she wouldn't dare stir up trouble again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Paula showed up, Queenie was determined to ruin her completely&mdash;dragging Diana down with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Paula dared to tell her about this, it meant she was fully prepared for everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan said, "Queenie, I'll go right now. I have ways to mess with Paula. Once she's scared, she'll cave. And I won't let Diana off the hook either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie urged him, "Dylan, go now. </span><span>W</span><span>aiting for your good news."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan looked at George and said, "Steven, you take Queenie home first. I'll handle the rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan left with a big smile on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George frowned and said, "He's a total loser. What do you expect him to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sneered, "George, he can take the fall for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George chuckled, "Not a bad idea. Let's go home. My dad's already made his move, we need to be ready."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana got home and, as usual, went upstairs to take a shower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forty minutes later, she finally stepped out of the bathroom, grabbed the remote from the table, and turned on the lights.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room instantly lit up brightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana saw the man sitting by the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was dressed in a white casual outfit, his expression gentle under the light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt like she was looking at the boy from years ago, and she was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meeting his gaze, Diana's eyes were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven</span><span>, however, was staring at her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her breasts are full, must feel amazing," he thought, a hint of excitement flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana followed his gaze and suddenly realized something. She looked down at her thin nightgown. She wasn&rsquo;t wearing any underwear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She blushed deeply, quickly climbed onto the bed, and pulled the blanket over herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pulling the blanket up to her chin, she glared at Steven angrily, "Why are you here? Aren't you afraid someone will find out you're still alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven found her panicked look adorable. He smiled and said, "I came to see you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven finally understood that all of life's hardships were his to overcome, and the greatest obstacle was himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one likes pain, but someone is willing to go through it with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That person is the one who truly loves him. Diana has always cared about him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But sometimes, pain makes Steven feel alive. Pain is its own kind of thrill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The resentment in his heart were hard to let go of.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of that, he missed out on so much beauty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was afraid of pain, so he rejected her love. But in the end, he was still in pain, and he lost years of what could have been their beautiful time together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana finally said, "Well, you've seen me now. You can go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze. It was the first time she had seen him smile like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Steven she remembered was always cold and distant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That gentle smile made Diana's heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn, what is he doing?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shifted slightly, then let out a soft groan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana snapped her eyes to him and said, "What's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pulled his shirt aside, glanced at the wound, and frowned. "My wound opened up. It's fine," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For Helen's sake, I can show a little concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "If you're hurt, you should be resting. You know I'm fine, so why did you even come to see me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pointed toward the window, "Turn around. I'll get dressed and then take care of your wound."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn&rsquo;t understand why he came here on such a cold day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "Diana, we're still married."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a cold laugh. "Married? All I know is you've been scheming against me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it weren&rsquo;t for Helen, I wouldn&rsquo;t have tolerated you this long."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt oddly pleased by her tolerance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly looked at her seriously and said, "Diana, if anything happens to me, the company will be my compensation to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at him, her tone sharp. "What? Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. Steven, you need to live as miserably as I did before. That&rsquo;s the only way you can atone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gave a bitter smile. "I will, Diana. Lately, I've been having this dream&mdash;a man kneeling in the dark, begging God for a second chance for his wife and child."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana froze mid-step as she was getting out of bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" She stared at him, stunned. "What did you just say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her, both excited and shocked. She really had been pregnant back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the dream, she and their child were killed by George. After coming back, she had treated Steven as her enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t until George showed up that she began to reconcile with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like now, she </span><span>was </span><span>still worr</span><span>ied</span><span> about his wound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana clearly heard what Steven said, but </span><span>s</span><span>he refused to talk about it any further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gave him a puzzled look, then went to get dressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wrapped in a blanket, she went to get dressed. After putting on her clothes, she grabbed the medical kit and walked back to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take off your shirt," she said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1050.html">« Prev</a><a href="1052.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
