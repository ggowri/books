I really dislike these two friends of yours. During those two years when you were blind and unable to move your legs, although they helped you, they rarely visited you. They cling to you only to benefit from you. They believe you still have a chance to recover, so they never cut ties with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yanson is a bit more sincere than Owen. He handled your work matters abroad without betraying you. However, his work was not thorough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't know if he's sincere or just made mistakes at work. Since I took over your company, I've uncovered many issues, such as discrepancies in the accounts. When projects had problems, he wouldn't actively resolve them. He merely guarded the company for you, ensuring no one dared to cause trouble within it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt sorry for Steven. Apart from Evan and his two secret bodyguards, no one was truly sincere to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No, he still has her and his grandparents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her deeply and said, "Diana, having your trust is enough for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned. When he said this, her heart felt no ripple. If she had heard these words a year ago, she would have been too happy to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because she would feel that the man she deeply loved was finally moved by her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, her heart is no longer the same as it was back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana could see that Steven cared deeply about Owen and Yanson. They didn</span><span>'</span><span>t betray him when he was in trouble, so in his heart, the two of them were already his good friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had to go see that bastard Owen. She thought for a moment and said, "I'm going out for a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the mischievous smile in her big eyes, Steven laughed and said, "You want to watch the show?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With slightly flushed cheeks, Diana admitted, "I want to see Owen's reaction when he sees me. I've been feeling pretty bored lately. If someone surprises me once in a while, I won't be so bored."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought, "If she leaves, I'll be bored at home too." So, he said, "Let's go together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Diana was a bit surprised to hear his words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Since when did you become so curious about other people's business?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "I also feel pretty bored lately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana agreed, thinking, "He should see Owen's embarrassing moments when he's in trouble. Someone like Owen needs to go through a few hardships to truly understand who he is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Alright, let's go together. Make sure to wear a mask when you go out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had a mask ready. He immediately went upstairs to put it on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked Luna to get the car. After Steven came downstairs, they headed straight to the hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way, Diana was quite lucky. Luna bought a matcha cake. Diana had a slice of cake and a cup of hot chocolate, instantly feeling happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and said, "I'm going to gain a lot of weight this month."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the hot chocolate cup she tossed in the trash, Steven reminded her, "Diana, drinking too much hot chocolate isn't good. You've been having hot chocolate for three days in a row."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly looked at him. "How do you know I've been drinking hot chocolate for three days in a row?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven squinted his eyes. At this moment, he had a strange face. However, his aura remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained, "I saw three hot chocolate cups in the trash can."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana breathed a sigh of relief, thinking, "I thought he was secretly watching me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her breathe a sigh of relief, Steven also relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To ensure her safety, he installed surveillance in the villa and the company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the hotel, Owen called his bodyguards and kicked all the reporters out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, only Owen, Roger, and Jocelyn were left in the private room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting dressed, Owen lazily sat on the sofa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen's face was extremely grim. He picked up the cigarette on the bedside table again, lit it with a lighter, and took a deep drag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the thin smoke, he squinted at Roger across from him. His gaze was icy, but his voice was hoarse. "Roger, is framing me fun?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger frowned and angrily said, "Owen, what are you talking about? If you say I framed you, then show me the evidence. If you can't provide evidence, I'll sue you for rape today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking out his phone, Roger sneered, "Owen, you probably haven't had time to check the news yet. The Toby family's stock has already hit the limit down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen was furious upon hearing this news.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From last night until now, everything seems perfectly arranged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last night, he was forced to drink. When he left, no one helped him, but Jocelyn showed up. Not only that, as he recalls now, he realizes he got drunk unusually fast, and his body inexplicably heated up. He left the private room because he sensed something was wrong, and he still remembers some of what happened afterward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Roger, what makes you think I can't provide evidence? Don't forget, I have Steven helping me. You can't touch me," Owen said angrily, but his aura remained strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger sneered, "No matter who backs you, they can't save you this time. You've committed rape. She's my wife and your elder."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jocelyn was still sitting on the bed. Hearing Roger's words, she became even more upset and started crying uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She choked up and said, "Roger, you must help me. If you don't seek justice for me, I won't live anymore. I'll climb to the rooftop and jump off, defending my dignity with my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Owen instantly became even angrier. He looked at Jocelyn with deep disgust in his eyes. "If you want to die, it's easy. The window over there is open. If you want to die, you can jump right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jocelyn froze, shrinking her neck slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen continued, "Roger, you know very well whether you and your wife framed me. I've already asked my dad to investigate. Roger, if I get the evidence, I'll make your life a living hell."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Owen's calm demeanor, Roger frowned tightly, thinking, "Could he really find the evidence?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Roger wasn't afraid because they had other plans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smirked playfully and said coldly, "Owen, you have no evidence. Before you get any, go spend some time at the police station."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger thought, "His dad is so busy right now, how could he possibly have time to help him find evidence?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, Owen heard the sound of sirens approaching from afar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen stubbed out his cigarette, stood up angrily, and glared at Roger. If he ended up in the police station, the rape charge would be confirmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, everything just now was captured by the reporters. It was all perfectly arranged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen said angrily, "Roger, to frame me, you even used your wife. Are you sure she's really your wife?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger laughed and said, "What nonsense are you talking about? Don't you know my ex-wife and I divorced two years ago? She's the wife I married just two months ago. Now she's been raped by you, and you claim I'm framing you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1063.html">« Prev</a><a href="1065.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
