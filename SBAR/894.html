Even now, at this moment, he couldn&#x27;t let go of Paula.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Unable to hold back, she yelled, &quot;Paula! You were poisoned! How are you still standing here perfectly fine?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The truth was already out, so she had nothing to lose by demanding answers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her plan, it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be like this. Paula should have been the one suffering, not her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She clenched her fists, fury bubbling to the surface. She was meant to be the one enjoying the Barnes family&#x27;s wealth and glory, not left humiliated like this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula turned back slowly and spoke under Amelie&#x27;s burning glare. &quot;It&#x27;s simple. I realized early on what Jeff was planning. You all wanted to send me to a mental hospital, destroy my children, and hand my company to Queenie. Your greed and ambition were so obvious, so clumsy, that it was laughable. So, I switched the poison.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Every dose after that? You were the one taking it, Jeff. It didn&#x27;t drive you insane, but it ruined your health. You already had high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar issues. Back then, when I thought you cared, I wasted so much time trying to help you manage it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But then you turned around and indulged yourself with Amelie, eating nothing but greasy, salty junk. Your health? It&#x27;s completely wrecked now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her words struck like a thunderclap. Jeff, Queenie, and Amelie stood frozen, their expressions filled with disbelief and shock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s lips trembled as she muttered, barely audible, &quot;So... the real fools were us all along.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paula surveyed their reactions, her eyes brimming with satisfaction.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She especially relished the devastation on Jeff and Amelie&#x27;s faces.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The room was silent for a long moment until Amelie&#x27;s scream shattered the stillness. &quot;This is insane! Absolutely insane! Jeff, Queenie, weren&#x27;t you two supposed to be so clever?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How did it come to this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her outburst was cut short as Jeff slapped her across the face, his expression icy and distant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Amelie, have I not given you enough? What more do you want? Everything Paula has, her family&#x27;s wealth, their legacy, it&#x27;s the result of generations of effort. What right do you have to take it without lifting a finger?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie laughed bitterly, clutching her stinging cheek. Her voice was sharp, laced with mockery.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jeff, after all these years of pretending to be part of high society, do you really think you&#x27;re someone to be respected? Don&#x27;t forget, the one who wanted to take everything from Paula was always you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You think I&#x27;ve wronged you? You&#x27;re the kind of man who didn&#x27;t even hesitate to abandon his own daughter. Who wouldn&#x27;t be afraid of you?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Even beasts protect their young. But you? You&#x27;re worse than an animal.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her words pierced deep, and Jeff&#x27;s face darkened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Memories of his past sins weighed heavily on him, and regret twisted his expression.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought of Diana, how careful and attentive she&#x27;d been when she first returned, preparing his favorite meals and tending to his health.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But in the end, he had thrown all of that away for Queenie. For a child who wasn&#x27;t even his own, he had destroyed everything, leaving himself with nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His gaze turned cold as he looked at Amelie. She was the reason for all of this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie caught the murderous glint in his eyes and instinctively stepped back, fear creeping into her expression.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jeff, you...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">But he said nothing. Instead, he turned to Tracey, his voice calm but resolute. &quot;Mom, let&#x27;s go home.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tracey cast a disdainful look at Amelie, her words sharp. &quot;Amelie, I look forward to seeing your downfall. You&#x27;re nothing short of despicable.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie sneered, though her defiance was shaky. &quot;And your son is any better? Don&#x27;t forget, he&#x27;s the one who lied to me in the first place!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tracey chuckled coldly. &quot;Oh, he lied to you, no doubt about that. But you? You were all too eager to fall for it. Who else can you blame?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for giving birth to a son who isn&#x27;t even worthy of being called my grandson. Even Queenie, for all her faults, is leagues ahead of your pitiful son.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie&#x27;s shrill screams echoed through the room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She couldn&#x27;t believe she was the one losing in the end.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mom, stop it already!&quot; Queenie snapped, her patience snapping like a taut thread.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie quickly grabbed her hand. &quot;Queenie, you need to help your brother. He&#x27;s really capable, you know.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie shot a look at Noah and scoffed, &quot;Capable? Noah, after all these years of getting that money, you haven&#x27;t done anything with it, have you? You&#x27;re only back now because your business overseas is falling apart, right?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Noah let out a sly smile. &quot;What are you talking about? My business isn&#x27;t failing. I came back because I missed you and Mom. My business is doing just fine. With Christmas coming, I thought we could all be together, but I didn&#x27;t expect things to blow up like this.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie chuckled. &quot;Noah, you really get me. I missed you too. Come on. Let&#x27;s go home.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie glanced at her mom, then finally asked the question she had been holding in for so long. &quot;Mom, is my dad really Jeff?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">There was a trace of hope in her eyes as she looked at Amelie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amelie nodded. &quot;Yes, your father is Jeff.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie bit her lip. Sometimes, she wished her dad wasn&#x27;t Jeff but some other powerful big shot.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She let out a frustrated sigh. &quot;Let&#x27;s just go home.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With her heart heavy, Queenie followed behind them. As she watched Noah&#x27;s back, she wondered who his father was.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A cold smile curved her lips.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wouldn&#x27;t let herself fail, not to mention lose to Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once they were far enough ahead, she pulled out her phone and sent a message.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[The Gellar Manor. I want Diana gone.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Got it, Ms. Marsh.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Reading the reply, Queenie smirked darkly, thinking, &quot;Diana, if I can&#x27;t have peace, neither can you. Why does Steven care so much about you while I get left behind?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Queenie left, Luna, who had been watching from a distance, quickly walked away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She sent the video she had recorded to Diana.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, Diana and Steven were walking out of a movie theater with Helen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They had just watched a comedy, and even as they stepped out, the smiles on their faces hadn&#x27;t faded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Helen was grinning from ear to ear. &quot;Diana, it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve had this much fun! You young people sure know how to pick a good movie. I laughed so hard today. I feel like I&#x27;ve turned younger!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana smiled, happy to see Helen so joyful. &quot;Grandma, if you enjoy movies so much, I&#x27;ll come over every weekend to watch with you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And in the spring, there will be more comedies coming out. I&#x27;ll take you to see those too.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;That sounds wonderful! Having you around will be such a treat. All my old friends do is compare whose kids are successful and whose aren&#x27;t. I&#x27;m so sick of it. I&#x27;d rather learn something new, watch movies, read books, and just enjoy myself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as Diana was about to speak, her phone buzzed. She pulled it out and opened the video message. Her eyes widened in surprise.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="893.html">« Prev</a><a href="895.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
