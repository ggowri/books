She swore she would definitely take revenge on Paige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Queenie like this, Paige felt pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go, Diana." Paige raised her chin as if she had won and left with Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't even look at Steven and followed Paige away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they got outside the venue and looked at the clear sky, Paige asked Diana, "Diana, how do you feel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled happily, "I feel pretty good. Paige, you are right. It's useless to persuade them. We didn't stop Frank, and he did what he wanted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige nodded. "I hope he likes this surprise. I tried to persuade him before, but he always thought I was jealous of Elsie. But it's good for us to leave. Steven and the Marsh family are all unreasonable bastards. Let's go back to the island. The ten male models are still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Every one of them is handsome. I know you are free in the next few days, so come with me to play. You like free snorkeling. I checked the weather forecast, and the weather tomorrow and the day after tomorrow will be very good. We can't go to the sea in the future. It will be too cold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought about it. She didn't need to finish the design in a hurry, and Leopold was not at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's set off today. I'll go back and get some things." Diana decided to relax for a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank would be in a miserable state next, but Diana didn't know where he would fall into the water, so it had nothing to do with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go. I'll introduce you to another handsome man. You will definitely like him." Paige pulled Diana and prepared to leave. "There are many excellent men in this world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was about to leave when someone grabbed her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned around and saw Steven. His hand was warm, and the warmth spread to her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't seen Steven for several days. Every time she met him, she would be tempted by his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given Steven's outstanding appearance, few women could refuse him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned. "Take your hand off me, Mr. Gellar."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and asked, "Are you going to date men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "What I want to do has nothing to do with you, Mr. Gellar. You should go back and comfort Queenie. Paige just angered her. If she faints and is hospitalized, you will feel even more distressed for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven was angry. "Be serious, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her cold attitude broke his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was distant and indifferent, and Steven was increasingly confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana snorted, "Tsk, I'm concerned about Queenie. When I asked you not to go to see her before, you said I was making trouble. Now, I'm considerate of you, but you are angry. Mr. Gellar, what on earth do you want me to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven paused and looked distressed. "Don't go, Diana. I have something to tell you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said coldly, "Sorry, I have nothing to talk to you except about divorce. Let me go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven did not let her go. Instead, he held her wrist even tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Steven, you hurt me." Diana frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Steven loosened his hand a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Diana's bright and charming eyes, he said, "Don't date another man, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Paige said, "Mr. Gellar, you are really hypocritical. When you were dating another woman and hurting Diana, why didn't you remind yourself that you are married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven glanced at Paige coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paige was frightened, and she hurriedly hid behind Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Paige scolded Steven, she was afraid of him. His eyes were so cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana blocked Steven's sight and said, "Just get back at to me. Don't hurt Paige."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven sighed, "In your eyes, am I the kind of person who hurts others at will?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="377.html">« Prev</a><a href="379.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
