Even if I get lost in two years of love and family ties, I&#x27;ll wake up and leave you all behind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;There&#x27;s another reason I haven&#x27;t divorced you until now. You still need your medication. Your sight won&#x27;t go blind again. Three days before Queenie&#x27;s birthday, I gave you the last dose, telling myself that if you ever asked for a divorce again, I wouldn&#x27;t refuse. I would agree without hesitation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ve always understood that living without love is painful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I watched you fall head over heels for Queenie, and honestly, I envied that passion. You loved her so fiercely, and I even considered supporting you because I thought it would help. You didn&#x27;t need to do anything for me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ve held on for a reason.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s body tensed as he realized that unless she willingly chose to stay, no one could hold her back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her previous reluctance to divorce was for his sake, while all he ever did was disappoint her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He turned to face her, sincerity in his eyes. &quot;Diana, I&#x27;ve explained everything about Queenie. I once saw her as my savior, but now she&#x27;s just a fraud.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, he left, leaving no room for misunderstanding.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana stared blankly at his retreating figure, a smile escaping her lips as she whispered, &quot;Steven, I&#x27;m sorry, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to trust you anymore.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She changed into her pajamas and lay down, lost in thought, eventually drifting off to sleep.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven returned to the room four hours later. Seeing Diana asleep, he sat on the edge of the bed, admiring her silhouette as she lay with her back to him, wearing a simple dress.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The lights were still on, allowing him to see the large burn scars on her back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He paused, taking in the intricate white scars. Years had passed, and while they had faded, the evidence of her severe burns was still visible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven gently traced the scars with his fingers, his heart aching for her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He vowed not to let Diana down again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, you still care about me. I&#x27;ll work hard to make you fall in love with me again.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a soft smile, he lay down beside her and turned off the light, closing his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">...</p><p style="text-align:left;">The next morning, Steven rose early for a meeting.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As he saw Diana still sleeping soundly, he couldn&#x27;t help but envy her peaceful slumber. She could remain in one position and sleep through the night without stirring.</p><p style="text-align:left;">How wonderful it felt to open his eyes and see her right there!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven leaned over to admire her tranquil sleeping face. Her skin looked flawless, likely due to her good sleeping habits. He placed a gentle kiss on her forehead before leaving, feeling uplifted.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana woke up around nine o&#x27;clock.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Looking around, she had a faint feeling that someone had been sleeping beside her last night.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She glanced at the space beside her, puzzled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Usually, she slept well. No matter when it was, as long as she wanted to sleep, she would drift off quickly and deeply, often staying in one position until dawn.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rubbing her head, Diana recalled waking up briefly in the night, feeling a presence nearby, but she had thought it was just a dream.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her brows furrowed as she tried to remember more, but it slipped her mind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Barefoot, she got out of bed and opened the door to look outside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was gone, and her mood brightened instantly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With him around, she always felt uneasy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Feeling cheerful, Diana headed to the bathroom to wash up while humming a song.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After getting ready, she stepped outside to meet Paige and Althea, planning to grab breakfast first before enjoying the day, with a return to work scheduled for the next day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As she pulled open the door, she was greeted by a hotel staff member wheeling in breakfast.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="806.html">« Prev</a><a href="808.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
