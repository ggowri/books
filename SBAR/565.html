"But I haven't received any ransom calls yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pieces of the puzzle were starting to align in his mind. "If it was the same crew as last time, I could take them all down at once," he thought, determination settling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jameson..." Freya began, but he cut her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where does this woman live?" Felix demanded as he gazed out the window at the swirling snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of worry crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The baby could freeze out there in this storm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video he received, which they still couldn't trace back to its source, could have been sent by someone who knew exactly who took his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had been guarding the delivery room, waiting for his wife to be moved to her room. Both she and the baby had been peacefully asleep when he stepped out for a quick call. When Felix returned moments later, the child was gone, and it was a cruel coincidence that all the nearby cameras were down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This storm took out a lot of surveillance systems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Felix analyzed the newly surfaced footage, it hit him. The cameras had been functional before the baby was taken&mdash;afterward, they went dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no random kidnapping; it was orchestrated by a group working together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jameson, she's staying at the little building across the street, room 302," Freya replied, her voice filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix maintained his intense gaze on Freya, then pointed to a nearby bench. "Ms. Miller, I'm sorry, but to eliminate your involvement, I need you to place your phone on the bench and sit over there. I'll find this woman in the video and confirm you're not tied to this before I let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freya bristled at the accusation. "What? Mr. Jameson, I've told you the truth! Why would you think I'm in league with her? Your child is missing, and I'm worried sick, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was young, barely in his thirties, tall and strikingly handsome. Yet, it was his sharp, hawk-like eyes that demanded respect when he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freya felt her resolve wavering under his fierce stare, and she nodded quickly. "Alright, Mr. Jameson. I'll comply. I'll wait here while you go find the child. In this brutal weather, that little one can't afford to be outside for long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Felix turned on his heel and strode out, leaving two officers behind to keep an eye on Freya.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was aware that her friendship with Rachel made it critical to keep information contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Felix stepped outside, he summoned a few of his team members to track down Penelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Penelope was in a much different frame of mind. She was slicing beef into thin strips and tossing them into the air fryer while reveling in her own little celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, the aroma of her perfectly cooked beef filled the air, and Penelope happily munched on it, sipping beer and watching the blizzard swirl outside her window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter rang out, completely unfazed by the storm. "Gale, you can only be my child's father. The Marsh family fortune will flow into my son's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea, I'm going to make you suffer for the rest of your life&mdash;ha! Just think about it, ten million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was practically grinning at the thought. "Althea's family is wealthy; they'll have no trouble digging up that kind of cash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, downstairs in the hospital, Diana intercepted Felix and his team as they attempted to pursue Penelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exclaimed, urgency lacing her voice, "Hello, officer! I have to file a report! I just received a ransom call on my friend's phone, someone saying they've stolen her child and are demanding 10 million. But her kid was never taken! I heard the police chief's child is missing, and I believe they've made a mistake with the target. Here's the number they called from. They want 10 million in ransom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's brow furrowed as he processed what Diana was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So the kidnappers originally intended to take your friend's child, but got it wrong and took mine instead?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="564.html">« Prev</a><a href="566.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
