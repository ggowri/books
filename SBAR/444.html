You don't come home for months, and when you do, you start talking crazy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula frowned at him, wondering what he knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wondered if he could know about Queenie embezzling two hundred million from her company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The secretary, Jane Blackwood, had already been detained and was taken by the police today for questioning as an accomplice in the embezzlement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she was refusing to reveal where the money went.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula had ways to make her talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, Diana is so wicked. Today, when I lost a street race with my friend and needed a million-dollar ransom, she didn't help me. Instead, she spent fifty million dollars on a worthless piece of land that nobody wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, where did she get that fifty million dollars from? Besides embezzling from our company, where else could she possibly get that kind of money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff was also shocked that Diana had fifty million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have proof?" Paula fixed Eric with an icy stare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, what more proof do you need? The money in her hands is the proof!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, you could be sued for slander, you know. I've cut off your allowance, and since you can't find anyone else to bail you out, you've crawled back to Diana, who you bullied for years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're shameless! It's been almost a year since she cut ties with us. How could you bring yourself to call and ask her for help?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The topic made Eric's blood boil. "Mom, why'd you suddenly cut off my allowance? I've got zero savings! How am I supposed to live? I've got competitions coming up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula took a deep breath and feigned distress. "The company's situation is getting worse. We're two hundred million in debt, and today, I discovered that Jane embezzled two hundred million.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Starting now, I can't support your lifestyles anymore. You're all in your twenties, adults. It's time you earned your own living expenses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The company owes two hundred million. If we can't recover that money, I'll have to sell all our assets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned to Jeff. "Jeff, your company's worth about a hundred million dollars. I'm selling it to cover the company's losses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Paula, what gives you the right to sell my company? Weren't you supposed to be this brilliant businesswoman? Now the company's on the brink of bankruptcy, two hundred million in debt, and you want to use my company to plug the hole? No way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jeff's face twisted into an ugly snarl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He cursed inwardly, "Shit, Paula knew about the embezzled money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula smirked. If he thought this was bad...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The real show hadn't even started.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="443.html">« Prev</a><a href="445.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
