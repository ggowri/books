There were tears in her beautiful eyes. "Steven, do you think this is fun? You lied to me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes were deep. He apologized affectionately in the calmest voice. "Sorry, Diana. What I wanted most before was for you to leave me. But now I want to tie you tightly with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have consulted the fortune teller, and he said that you and I will be entangled for the rest of our lives. You are the woman I asked for, and I will not let you go," Steven said firmly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never thought of letting her go and be with another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned and found it unbelievable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Steven is a materialist. Does he actually believe this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was furious, tears streaming down her face. "Steven, you've crossed the line. Do you think I'm weak, so you keep pushing me around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was truly upset. Just when she was about to meet someone new and maybe fall in love again, she got tangled up with him once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven reached out and gently wiped the tears from her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry, silly. I wasn't lying to you. I figured out my feelings. I can't be without you, so I staged the fake divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That night, I was taken by Queenie's people. I had just come out of the operating room, and they took me to the beach and threw me into the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They thought I fainted. In fact, I knew they were going to do something to me, so I pretended to faint. When I fell into the sea, Evan brought people and rescued me. I made arrangements overnight." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the next day, when you got the divorce certificate, all the property under my name was transferred to your name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew that he had arranged it, but she didn't expect that he almost died again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was devastated. "I just want a divorce. I don't want to get involved in the Gellar family's mess and keep the property for you. You should be glad that I found another man who is exactly like you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are also a poor guy used by Queenie. That was the last time that I loved you. Why are you still pestering me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I am not pestering you. You are my wife. Don't forget that the time we agreed on has not come yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven said it with confidence. He had always been so domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked out the window angrily. She was really mad. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she got the divorce certificate, she was over the moon. She also suspected that everything went too smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana even thought of checking whether it was true or not after her legs got better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she didn't need to check anymore. She and Steven were still married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she would be angry, but he couldn't bear to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, he had a dream every day. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dream, there was a man kneeling on 990 steps, just to let his wife and children live again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dream, Steven could only see the man's back in the dark, and his voice sounded very painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was more and more reluctant to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even wondered if the dream was reminding him of something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't pinpoint when it started, but he began relying on her, missing her, unable to control his desire. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her laugh and chat with other men made him furious; he wanted to tie her up and keep her to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven spoke tenderly, "Diana, I'll prove to you I've never loved Queenie. You're my one and only."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold wind carried his heartfelt words, but Diana just laughed at his last statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your one and only? Everyone knows Queenie is the one you love," she said. "Steven, I just want you to understand there's no turning back for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why force things? Life is about meeting and parting ways. Right now, I'm in my prime, and I want to wait for the right man with all I have to offer. Please, let's divorce!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's breath trembled. Yes, she was 23 years old, and she was indeed in her prime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to greet another man who wanted to spend his life with her in the most beautiful manner. Young girls all had such ideas, but he didn't allow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still his wife now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, that man will be me. I won't let you go. Give me two months. I will solve all of this and let you have no worries." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please go home to rest. After this is resolved, I will be with you. No matter what the road ahead is like, I will never make you sad. We&rsquo;re meant to be together." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven kissed her on the top of her head, opened the car door, and got out reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the car door was closed, Diana burst into tears instantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know whether she was crying because she was deceived, or because her love was responded to, or because Steven said that she wouldn&rsquo;t get rid of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To love him, she swallowed her pride and confidence in front of him. She forgot her reserve and lost her sense of propriety. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved him foolishly. All she saw was him, and all she could think of was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be ready to spend her life with him, but he pushed her away. His coldness slowly drained her love for him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when she finally moved on, he just couldn't let go. Steven always knew how to keep her under his thumb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back, she was all reminded of the pain and devastation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in those memories seemed so superior, and Steven was always the coldest of them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some love lingered over the years, and when you thought back, it could bring a bittersweet warmth that makes you cry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for her, what the years left behind was pain that brought tears. Right now, she was </span><span>crying, feeling really, really </span><span>sad.Diana</span><span> cried for a long time, her heart sank deeper. But she quickly </span><span>regain</span><span> her composure and wiped away her tears. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She later asked Luna to get in the car and drive her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven got into the car behind and watched Diana's car leave. His eyes were no longer gentle but sharp and dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan noticed Steven's slightly swollen and bright lips. In no time, he knew Stven made a move on Diana again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Steven's eyes were dangerous at this time. His face was pale, which made his lips look like flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan whispered, "Mr. Gellar, your lips are broken. Do you need a hot towel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven came back to his senses when he heard his voice. His slender fingers gently stroked the lips bitten by Diana and laughed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, my wife bit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Evan was stunned. Seeing that Steven was very happy, Evan couldn't help teasing him, "Mr. Gellar, did you force Mrs. Gellar so she bit you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1030.html">« Prev</a><a href="1032.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
