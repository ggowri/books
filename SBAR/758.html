She wanted to go see Althea and her baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the opportunity to go out for three days because she felt uncomfortable staying with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't love him anymore, so she found him an eyesore.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her back with a heavy heart. He was thinking that they seemed unable to go back to the way they were before.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana remembered clearly every word he said to her and every wrong thing he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was busy with company affairs during those two years and didn't actually care about what Queenie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just too busy, and since Diana never mentioned it, he forgot about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie meant it and her words had an impact on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven took a deep breath, picked up the coat on the sofa, and left the villa. At that moment, he had an urge to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those things really happened to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Diana cared most about was the intimate contact between him and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, when you were in a bad environment, you would become a bad person like everyone else in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't think too much, and she was even unaware of Steven's regret and his distraught departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got her suitcase ready and went out. After getting in the car, she drove to the mall and bought a lot of baby clothes. At the cashier desk, she bumped into Paula, who was also there to buy baby clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana first thought that she bought them for Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Queenie had already had an abortion.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter who Paula bought the baby clothes for, Diana didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was surprised to see that Diana was also buying baby clothes, and her eyes instantly fell on her belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana understood what Paula meant instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She thinks I'm pregnant," Diana thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed sarcastically and said, "Don't worry, it's not me. Do you remember when you asked me to marry Steven, you warned me condescendingly? You told me Steven was Queenie's man and asked me not to dream of having his child. So, I'll never have his child again in this life. I'll leave it to Queenie."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words were harsh, and it would be a lie to say that she didn't hate Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could indeed not hate her as long as no one mentioned the past, but as soon as she saw her, her hatred would burst out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was slightly stunned. She had actually said those words. "Diana, at that time I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to explain. No matter what your mentality was at that time, it has nothing to do with me. I've already repaid you for giving birth to me. The matter concerning Jeff, you know. When you see me in the future, please pretend that you don't know me. I'll never forgive you for what you did to me in my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was ruthless. Whenever she thought of Paula's words, she would feel heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the anger and hatred in her eyes, Paula stopped herself from saying what was in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, for Queenie, that shameless and vicious woman, she had hurt her daughter with the most vicious words in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and said, "Diana, I'm sorry! I didn't know anything at that time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed angrily and interrupted her coldly, "Does this have anything to do with your harsh words and Queenie's true colors? In the final analysis, you disliked that I was not presentable and would bring shame to your family. Don't use "you don't know" to cover up what you've done to me. I've said that I'll never forgive you. I mean it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly paid the bill and left the mall. She was pissed off so early in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula stood there in pain. Thinking of what she had done to Diana for Queenie, she wished she could kill herself.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="757.html">« Prev</a><a href="759.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
