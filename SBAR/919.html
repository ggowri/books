My team has been working on this for nearly two years now, and we're currently in the clinical trial phase, collaborating closely with regulatory authorities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I'm the president of the Gellar Group, we'll be developing this project together. I hope all of you shareholders will supervise us. In just six months, we should be ready for a formal launch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones was visibly excited. If this project succeeded and was widely implemented nationwide, the potential was staggering. "Great! Ms. Bishop, I'm all in, but we need to meet your team next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His respect for Diana had grown. The proposal was impressive, but he needed to see if the project matched its brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him, and her smile was bright and confident. "Absolutely! We have a lot to handle today, but tomorrow morning, I'll take you to the lab for a firsthand experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom had been preparing tirelessly, spending every spare moment in the lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a genuinely compassionate doctor, always putting patients first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders were pleased. They didn't care who the president was. What mattered was whether their leader could deliver profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their world, everything was measured by gain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones stood, looking at Diana with admiration. "Ms. Bishop, I'm hosting a banquet tomorrow evening in your honor. You have to come. I'll introduce you to some of my friends, and if you need investment for your upcoming projects, I can help with that, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and her enthusiasm was infectious, "Sounds great! I appreciate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones nodded slightly and began to lead everyone out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Andrew stepped in front of Leones. "Leones, you can't leave! You promised you'd support me. How can you walk away now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones glanced at him, and a cold smile was on his face. "Mr. Andrew Gellar, I assume you just rolled out of bed, right? Are you late for such an important meeting? How can I trust you to manage the company when you can't even manage your own time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's voice was strained. "Leones, it's a misunderstanding! I got stuck in traffic on the way here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought to herself, "Traffic? More like he was lost in a woman's embrace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she had played a part in that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Andrew arrived on time, he and Jace would have been a distraction. So, Diana had separated them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised her was Jace's downfall. She had no idea who had orchestrated that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had come at just the right moment to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wondered, "Could it be Steven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden pang shot through her heart at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unexpected pain stirred deep within her, leaving her feeling conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought she wouldn't feel anything for Steven anymore, yet her heart ached involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling made her uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leones gave Andrew a final glance before walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew turned to other board members, but no one was willing to engage with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shot Diana a meaningful look before turning to leave the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt humiliated for staying. Diana had hidden her true capabilities, making Queenie look foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, just you wait!" George warned with cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him, and her smile was unwavering. "Mr. Gellar, if you can't take the heat, maybe you should think twice before signing agreements in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George shot her a glare, with his frustration palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew felt utterly defeated. After years of scheming, it had all come to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward and Helen had truly shown him no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you really impressed me! I underestimated you. But now, I'm going to make you pay for what you did today," Andrew said, his voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh. "Mr. Andrew Gellar, let me remind you, your company has been stagnant for the past ten years. Sticking to the same old ways is already a loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was left speechless. "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, he shook his head in frustration and stormed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sighed in relief, taking a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's melodic laughter rang in her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna couldn't help but chuckle at Diana's expression, and soon, Nick and Barry joined in the laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt her cheeks flush as she glanced around, and her expression was a bit awkward. "What are you all laughing at? Do you think it's easy for me? I haven't faced something like this in ages; I was pretty nervous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph looked at her with deep admiration. "Diana, you were incredible just now. What surprised me even more is how talented you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana sighed, and a hint of frustration was in her voice, "To reach this level of excellence, I had to endure so much hardship in the first fifteen years of my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wake up at 5:30 every morning, and aside from meals and bathroom breaks, I spend nearly twelve hours studying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no such thing as a genius&mdash;just relentless effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every morning, I familiarize myself with the languages of different countries, study finance at noon, keep learning in the afternoon, work out in the evening, and dedicate two hours to learning to drive. My life is filled to the brim with everything I want to learn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Diana felt a beautiful sense of fulfillment after all her struggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking care of Steven for those two years had been the busiest and most exhausting time of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph was still in shock. Hard work was essential, but talent was equally important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, from now on, you're my goddess," he declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna laughed. "Joseph, you sure know how to sweet-talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Joseph's gaze remained fixed on Diana. "I only sweet-talk Diana!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna beamed. "Diana, this is such a satisfying ending. You really showed Queenie who's boss. She ruined your family, and karma will catch up with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly interjected, "Luna, let's not dwell on the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, here's my divorce certificate. It's still new."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out the certificate to show Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna stared, bewildered. "Diana, why do you carry your divorce certificate around with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the certificate, smiling brightly, "Luna, the best way to honor life is to spend every day on meaningful things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time is too short. We shouldn't waste our prime years on anything less than our best selves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm beautiful and accomplished, and there's so much more greatness ahead of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna blinked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph laughed heartily. "Diana, you're still young. You'll meet someone even better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shared that sentiment. From now on, she wouldn't let her divorce weigh her down with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her friends, she smiled and couldn't help but exclaim, "Ah... the future is so bright!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="918.html">« Prev</a><a href="920.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
