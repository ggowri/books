You&#x27;ll get carsick. Put it away and sit properly.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Caught off guard, Diana blinked. &quot;Oh... okay.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was about to hand the phone back when a message notification flashed across the screen.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Diana, I found over a dozen male escorts with amazing builds. Wanna come check them out? Don&#x27;t worry. They&#x27;re not the bulky types you hate. These guys are fit, toned, and perfectly balanced. Absolute eye candy!]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s jaw tightened, his anger bubbling to the surface.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil was suggesting male escorts to his wife.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He let out a slow, controlled breath, his fury barely contained. The icy look in his eyes could freeze someone on the spot.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Next to him, Diana suddenly felt a chill in the air. She glanced at him, not understanding why he was suddenly so angry.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When their eyes met, the streetlights illuminated her delicate face, her lashes trembling lightly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the next moment, Steven reached out, pulling her close in one swift motion. His arm locked firmly around her waist, leaving her no room to escape.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven!&quot; Diana gasped, completely caught off guard. &quot;What&#x27;s gotten into you? Let me go!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her protests were met with silence as his intense gaze bore into hers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His handsome face was mere inches away, and the sheer masculinity radiating from him left her flustered. Her heart raced as she struggled to keep her composure.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Tell me, Diana. What&#x27;s so great about male escorts? Are they better looking than me? Fitter than me?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If it&#x27;s abs you like, I&#x27;ve got plenty. Want to touch them? Go ahead. If it&#x27;s a handsome face, take a good, long look. I&#x27;m not lacking in that department either.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Or is it youth? Fine, I&#x27;ll dress however you like. Let&#x27;s see if any of those so-called escorts can hold a candle to me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His words spilled out one after another, his confidence palpable. But the sharp edge in his voice revealed just how furious he was.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana froze, her mind racing. She had a pretty good idea what might have set him off, which was Cecil&#x27;s message.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She quickly tried to calm him down. &quot;Steven, relax! What&#x27;s wrong? What male escorts are you even talking about?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His laugh was cold, cutting. &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m calm. But since you&#x27;re apparently so dissatisfied you need male escorts to entertain you, I&#x27;ll make sure tonight you don&#x27;t feel the need to look elsewhere.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before she could respond, Steven tilted her chin up and kissed her hard, his lips dominating hers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">One hand slipped beneath the loose neckline of her top, his palm pressing against her softness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana&#x27;s eyes flew wide open, a mix of shock and humiliation washing over her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Steven she knew was always calm and collected, but tonight, he was losing control.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His hands explored further, unapologetically bold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The sensation under his fingers was intoxicating, something he couldn&#x27;t put into words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only with her did he feel this kind of connection.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His fingers moved skillfully, teasing her most sensitive spots.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana couldn&#x27;t help but let out a soft whimper, her body betraying her as the sensations overwhelmed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Completely losing control, Steven cupped the back of her head and deepened the kiss, leaving Diana struggling to catch her breath.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She pushed against him, but he only held her tighter, his dominance absolute.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, a blinding beam of light shot straight toward them from the front.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s reaction was instant. He leapt to his feet and threw himself over Diana, shielding her completely in his arms.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The night exploded with the terrifying sound of a violent collision.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The impact was so intense that Diana felt as if her life was hanging by a thread, teetering on the edge of oblivion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Amidst the chaos, she heard Steven&#x27;s labored breaths and his muffled groan of pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">For a fleeting moment, despite the overwhelming terror, she felt an unfamiliar sense of security.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Time seemed to slow to a crawl. Her head slammed into the seatback, a sharp pain shooting through her skull.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The acrid, metallic scent of blood filled the air, thick and nauseating. As a doctor, she recognized it immediately.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She could feel Steven&#x27;s body weakening against her, and something sharp seemed to have pierced through him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His shallow, uneven breathing brushed past her ear, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to drown out the sickening sound of bones cracking.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That sound alone shattered her composure, and tears spilled uncontrollably down her face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven!&quot; she screamed, her voice hoarse and trembling with despair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Gellar! Madam! Mr. Gellar!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan&#x27;s frantic voice rang out from outside, accompanied by the desperate banging on the car window.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing him, Diana shouted back, her voice trembling with urgency, &quot;Evan! Call an ambulance! Hurry! Now!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She forced herself to snap out of the panic. Her first instinct was to save Steven.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven deserved to pay for his sins, but not like this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even if it meant trading life for life, he owed her and their child far more than just this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan wasted no time and called for emergency service.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He&#x27;d followed behind their car after wrapping up his tasks and hadn&#x27;t expected to witness such a horrifying accident.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Inside the car, Steven was still holding Diana tightly, her head resting on his shoulder. The steering wheel was crushed against his legs, pinning him in place.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She could barely see his face through the shattered windshield, but what little she could see was deathly pale. He had lost consciousness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">An unbearable weight pressed down on her chest, making it hard to breathe. Her tears blurred her vision as a wave of helplessness and sorrow engulfed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had never wanted to owe Steven anything in this lifetime.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Moments ago, he could have jumped out of the car. But he chose to protect her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A bitter taste rose in her throat, and her heart ached with a mix of anger and grief. Her tears fell silently, soaking into the depths of her despair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Madam! Madam, hold on! The rescue team is on its way! The entire front of the car is crushed. Can you move at all?&quot; Evan&#x27;s voice was filled with worry.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Behind him, the bodyguards had already subdued the driver of the other car.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evan shot a cold glance at the trembling man, who immediately dropped to his knees, terrified.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana took a deep breath, trying to steady herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She reached for her handbag with trembling hands. As a doctor, she always carried essential emergency medication.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her fingers found the pill bottle, and she carefully unscrewed it. With a deliberate calmness, she turned toward Steven, gently tilting his head to one side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She placed the pill into his mouth, pressing his lips shut with her fingers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Steven,&quot; she whispered close to his ear, her voice choked with emotion, &quot;swallow it. If you&#x27;re going to die, it won&#x27;t be like this. Not this way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;In our last life, you pushed me down the stairs. You killed me and our child. Two lives, Steven. Two lives you owe me. If you&#x27;re going to die, it&#x27;s to repay that debt. Nothing less.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A tear slipped from the corner of Steven&#x27;s closed eyes, but Diana was too lost in her own grief to notice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the distance, the sound of sirens grew louder.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana quickly wiped her face, forcing her composure. Turning to Evan, she said firmly, &quot;Get ready. Save Steven first.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="897.html">« Prev</a><a href="899.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
