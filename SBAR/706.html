You must attend the charity gala tomorrow night. No one really cares about the rumors. They were everywhere now anyway.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Levi: [I will also arrange everything for you to attend the charity gala, making you famous overnight. Of course, the matter of your pregnancy will definitely be a lie.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie finally understood. Despite all that Levi had done, he still refused to acknowledge that she was pregnant with his child.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked extremely ruthless. Levi must become her sharpest blade; she would use him as a stepping stone, something she believed he owed her.

I bet you don't even know who the father of the child is," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shouted, "Diana, what nonsense are you spouting? The only man in my life is Steven, and the child is his. If you know what's good for you, get out and leave Steven. He's mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled since she had given her the evidence she craved most.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had always looked down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and said, "Queenie, thank you for giving me the evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie asked angrily, "Diana, what do you mean?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="705.html">« Prev</a><a href="707.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
