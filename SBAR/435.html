It was Eric Marsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was hardly a good person, and she had no intention of rescuing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have no ties to the Marsh family anymore. You can do what you want&mdash;beat him, kill him; it's your choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'm your brother. You can't just watch me die! We're blood relatives. How can you be so heartless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric's anger crackled through the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana frowned. This situation hadn't happened in her previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, after Frank's accident, Eric only returned during her birthday party, and he ended up in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Queenie took everything from him, he tried to kill her but failed and ended up in jail, his fate just as grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, she would respect others' destinies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why was this happening months earlier?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because she had changed her past?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied mockingly, "Eric, when you need me, I'm your sister. When you don't, I'm just an outsider. Go look for your real sister, Queenie. She's the one you treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you forgotten what you've done to me? Why would I come to save you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric laughed darkly. "Diana, I'm asking you for help because I actually think you're worth it. Queenie, the darling of the Marsh family, wouldn't dare come to this place. You're just a rough country girl; a few hits won't kill you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a mix of anger and amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So that was how he viewed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears brimmed in her eyes as if her soul had been stripped away, her inner torment enveloping her world like ink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She broke down, tears falling silently to the floor. She inhaled deeply, trying to stifle the pain, but the tears still overflowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did those assholes have to trample on her dignity like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, you're the worst. I won't come to save you; stop dreaming."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I command you to come save me! Bring a million. I know you have it. If you help me, I'll let you back into the Marsh family as my sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana coldly replied, "I don't want it. Who would want to be your sister? I've never been your sister. I'm someone here to settle the score."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you angry, you country bumpkin? It's a privilege for you to help me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric remained arrogant and self-righteous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You keep that privilege to yourself. Goodbye! Eric, your broken hands and feet are no concern of mine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she prepared to hang up, Eric shouted, "Mr. Morrison, you must let Diana come here tonight. My sister is quite beautiful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the mention of Mr. Morrison, Diana's heart raced with recognition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "What's the address?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="434.html">« Prev</a><a href="436.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
