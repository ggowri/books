Her mind flashed back to the day Diana had coldly declared that she'd drag her into hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes gleamed with mockery. "What's wrong, Queenie? Cat got your tongue? When you schemed against me, did I ever not suffer in silence? And now, when I'm just returning the favor, you think throwing yourself on the ground, crying, and playing the victim will wipe your slate clean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me tell you something, Queenie. A person's character, their upbringing, even their wealth and power... they all go hand in hand. With your kind of morals, how long do you think you'll keep strutting around like a peacock?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana believed in karma. Her second chance at life had only strengthened that belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, she would see Queenie get what was coming to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's body trembled violently. She had blood on her hands and had committed more sins than she could count. But karma? She scoffed at the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you're better off dead!" she hissed through clenched teeth, her eyes blazing with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted nothing more than to tear Diana apart right then and there. But deep down, she knew she didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, she swore silently that Diana would meet a fate worse than death one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn't even bother sparing her another glance. "Grandma, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen was just about to leave when George stepped in front of them, blocking their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma, I'm your grandson! Why are you siding with her? Diana is nothing! You can't leave with her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen looked up at him, sighing at the stubborn streak in his eyes. She wanted to pat his shoulder to calm him, but he was too tall, so she settled for a resigned shake of her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, I'm not going to interfere with your plans. Focus on building your career. As for the company, it's still under your father's name. But let's be honest. Look at him. He's completely lost his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've heard rumors that he's keeping two girls on the side. Girls younger than you, no less. He's spending his days in drunken debauchery. With a lifestyle like that, how can he possibly manage a company? No wonder the business has been in shambles these past few years. He's simply not fit to lead anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've made my decision. I'm transferring the management rights to you. Take the company and make something of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew's face turned beet red, clearly caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom... isn't it normal for men to have a few women outside?" he mumbled weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her sharp gaze silenced him instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned back to George with a softer expression. "Sweetheart, just wait for my good news. And one more thing. I'm done staying here. If you don't let me leave, I'll take back the management rights and kick you and your father out on the street."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen finally revealed her trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was all too clear that they wanted nothing more than to seize control of the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their blatant attempts to confine her here were a calculated move to isolate and manipulate Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their smug expressions, so confident in their presumed victory, filled her with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was determined to show them just how foolish it was to challenge her, a battle they were destined to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew, clearly flustered, snapped, "Mom, do you have to be so heartless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She raised an unimpressed eyebrow. "Have you done anything worthwhile for the company these past few years? Andrew, let's face it. You're past your prime. Your son is more capable than you are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let him take over. Focus on your hobbies. Go have fun with your women and stop meddling in business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew's face flushed even deeper, his ears burning with shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his mother air his dirty laundry in front of everyone left him utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his reaction, Helen smirked. "What's this? You're actually embarrassed? If you're ashamed now, you should've thought twice before doing all those disgraceful things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Move, will you? I'm still your mother, and I've lived long enough to stay out of your messy young people drama. So, how about you stay out of mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Andrew didn't budge, Helen jabbed him sharply in the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't test me! Just because I brought you into this world doesn't mean I'll let you boss me around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her resolute stance made Andrew's frustration boil over, but he exhaled slowly, trying to rein in his temper. Finally, he relented, his tone noticeably less combative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, just stay here. If Diana really cares about you, she can come live with you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, you are thoughtful. Fine, I'll stay here. It saves me the hassle of moving. You guys don't want the manor, so I'll just stay put.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for your son's wedding, you're the dad. You handle that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A feeling of relief washed over her as she spoke, like a burden had been lifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew, on the other hand, felt like a failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't even get the better of his own mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But deep down, he knew no one had ever cared for him more than she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always been there for him when he was sick, finding the best doctors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had to give credit to anyone for truly being a mother, it was her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, if you're not happy here, I'll find you somewhere else. Just say the word," Andrew said, trying to sound respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shook her head, clearly disgusted. "No need. Your places have all been tainted with your little affairs. I'd rather not step foot in one of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew was getting frustrated. "Mom, do you have to keep bringing that up? Everyone knows about it anyway. So what if I've had some fun? I'm almost 50! If I only have 20 years left. Shouldn't I enjoy myself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen rolled her eyes. "Enjoy yourself? I'm just worried you're going to have too much fun and drop dead before your time. What do you think I'll do if you go before me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom..." Andrew's voice trembled, part frustration, part helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her sharp words hit home, and his face turned stormy. His brows were furrowed so tightly they seemed like they might stay that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at you, getting all worked up," she said with a smirk. "I'm just being honest. Look at all the mess you've caused."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew wanted to snap, but he knew that maintaining a good relationship with his mother was crucial for his career to stay on track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a deep breath, he finally managed to calm down. "Fine, I'm going. I brought you your caviar. Enjoy it and live a long life, so I can take care of you for years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Helen smiled, satisfied. "Now that's more like it. I'll live long enough to make you regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pointed to the door. "Take your son and Queenie with you. As for Steven, he'll be fine. He doesn't need you holding his hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George opened his mouth to argue, but a glance from Andrew silenced him. "Let's go. You signed those papers. Deal with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George bit back his frustration. He knew he had to hold off for now, but he swore he'd get everything back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he turned to leave, he shot Diana a look full of hatred, already planning his next move.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="906.html">« Prev</a><a href="908.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
