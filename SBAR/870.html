She knew Sam </span><span>wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t cheat on her</span><span>. Her desire for a divorce stemmed from fear that he would side with Janet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing him firmly stand by her, she felt her resolve waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, let's be honest. He treated you as his sister, which is why he might have put you before me. But I am his wife, his partner. If he values you, so do I. And yet, how did you repay his sincerity? By trampling all over it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My presence never affected you. Before I came, you were happy. After I came, you were still happy. I never took anything away from you. So why did you try to </span><span>kill me and my baby</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The poisoning incident...I will report it to the police. Even if the Young family or Sam tries to protect you, I'll see this through to the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was determined not to let her humble background excuse someone who tried to </span><span>murder</span><span> her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam added firmly, "Honey, you said we're a team. How could I tolerate someone harming you and our child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet was never really part of the Young family. My mother adopted her. Over the years, while other children went without clothes, she wore like a princess. When others couldn't afford education, she went to elite schools."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some people are insatiable. Her greed made her dream of taking over the Young family. Why should I keep her around? I've already called the police and handed over all the evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam continued, his voice resolute. "Honey, I would never protect a woman this malicious. You and our son are all I care about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already told my mother everything that happened today. She's flying back from overseas and told me to handle this as I see fit. Our family owes Janet nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn was taken aback as she looked at him. Janet had caused her so much distress, and she had lost hope after being left behind by Sam repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her humble background had always made her feel pressured. She became pregnant soon after marrying Sam, but his mother treated her with genuine kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having experienced infidelity in her own marriage, Sam's mother understood Carolyn's pain. She never judged Carolyn's background, only asking that she stay sincere to her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn appreciated that deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, thank you for thinking this way, and thank you for standing by me and our child," she said, her voice softening. She knew Sam doted on his sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam smiled, pulling her into his arms. "Silly girl, you're my wife. If I can't protect you, I'd rather let you go than have you suffer with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone turned gentle. "Don't talk about divorce anymore. No one can tear us apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't abandon you before, not truly. Janet called me, claiming she was hurt. As her brother, I couldn't ignore her. But I always came back to you as quickly as I could. Those photos she sent were meant to provoke you. None of it was real."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I finally realized her intentions today. That won't happen again. From now on, aside from you and my mom, no one else will matter to me like that. They're not worth it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn's eyes grew misty as she smiled. "We'll see how you do. If you go back to your old ways, I'll insist on a divorce. I didn't marry you for money. I'm the one who was easy to be content. If being with you doesn't bring me joy, I'll leave you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't let you down," Sam said, holding her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched the couple with a faint smile. She felt a man like Sam, who fiercely protected his wife, was admirable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, standing to the side, felt a stab of pain seeing the smile on Diana's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet sat on the floor, her face pale. Sam had indeed called the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the officers arrived, Janet remained frozen, too ashamed to plead for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Young family truly owed her nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn turned to Diana. "Ms. Bishop, thank you for saving me. You saved me, my son, and my family. I'd like to be your friend. May I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana </span><span>knew</span><span> that Sam was a notable figure in the entertainment world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming friends with Sam's wife, especially after saving her life, was a significant gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Diana </span><span>smile</span><span>d. "Mrs. Young, from now on, we're friends. I'm Diana. Pleased to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carolyn beamed. "Diana, </span><span>just </span><span>call me Carolyn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shook hands, exchanged contact information, and Diana left with Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked, Diana reflected on everything that had just happened. Sam had managed to salvage his relationship. When Carolyn was in danger, he had prayed desperately for her safety. When she was wronged, he firmly stood by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the elevator, Diana lowered her head, staying silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was deep in thought. The scene they'd just witnessed had played out countless times between him, Diana, and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when he saw through Queenie's manipulations, he would still side with her and direct cold, cutting words at Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything that had happened, he doubted Diana would ever forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the elevator doors opened on Evan and Luna's floor, Diana stepped out, only to see Tom approaching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," he called. His white coat fluttered as he walked. His warm smile and calm demeanor were striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked handsome and cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tom," Diana greeted him with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your brother, well, not anymore, since you've cut ties, is in our hospital. Gale's leg... If he'd had surgery sooner, he could have recovered fully. Now, he might be able to walk, but he'll likely always have a limp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted to ask if you're willing to perform the surgery for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head firmly. "No. I refuse to help someone who once tried to find a group of men to ruin my life. Why should I save him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he's staying here, make him sign an agreement before the operation. That way, he can't cause trouble later. The Marsh family isn't worth trusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana would not forgive anyone in the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom wasn't surprised but smiled. "That's the Diana I know. We were all worried you'd keep sacrificing yourself for the Marsh family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leopold always said you were stubborn, and he was right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle the surgery," Tom added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded. "With your skill, he'll be able to stand again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom's talent was unmatched, and his dedication to medicine was inspiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no material desires, only a passion for medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice dripped with mockery behind her. "Diana, Gale is still your brother. Can you really bear to see him crippled for life?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="869.html">« Prev</a><a href="871.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
