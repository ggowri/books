Did young people today really flirt so boldly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, you don't have to look at me like that. I'm all about pure love," the young man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Diana couldn't help but laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did young boys really use such lines to flirt with girls?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she no longer believed in love&mdash;only in herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, looking at the bright-eyed boy in front of her, she smiled brightly. "Thanks. But no. Enjoy yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana playfully placed the popcorn in his lap. "It's really delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hoped the deliciousness of the popcorn would keep him from talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy chuckled, seemingly understanding her hint. His bright eyes sparkled with amusement as he gazed at her. "I thought I was making you laugh, but I didn't expect you to use this as a way to silence me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was surprised. This kid had quite a sense of self-awareness. His piercing gaze didn't resemble that of an ordinary boy, and his exceptionally expensive t-shirt suggested he came from a wealthy family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's not disturb others who are watching the movie," she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy laughed. "A good excuse," he thought. He stopped talking and leaned down to eat the popcorn. After a couple of pieces, he turned to Diana. "This is really tasty, especially good and fragrant!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied, "I'm glad you like it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even watching a movie could lead to flirtation. Steven was right&mdash;her face was indeed lethal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy leaned in closer and said softly, "Miss, date me! I have lots of money. I can give you everything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this made Diana laugh even more. She found him utterly adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That money isn't really yours. It's your family's. You should work hard. Only what's truly yours can weather any storm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy paused, then grinned. "You're right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the movie reached its climax&mdash;a deadlock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Micah eliminated everyone who had betrayed Lucy and then carried Lucy's body into the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy beside Diana remarked, "This is too tragic! In the next life, will they meet again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled. "Who knows? If it were me, in my next life, I'd prefer to have never met them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been thinking earlier that if she hadn't met Steven and Queenie after she was reborn, would that be better?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stared at her figure, his emotions complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss, the movie's over. Let's go," the boy said, standing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood up as well, leaving with him, both chatting and laughing. She completely failed to notice Steven, who still had a strong presence even in the dim light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Diana didn't notice him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sullen face, Steven followed them downstairs. Once they reached the bottom, Diana waved at the boy. "See you, handsome!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy waved back. "Miss, looking forward to our next meeting!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He left with a cheerful smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked away, still beaming. Was happiness in life really this simple?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, a kind word from a stranger could bring such joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had been trailing behind Diana, and for the first time, he realized she was quite an interesting person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would tease children on the street and buy food for stray dogs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She treated herself to ice cream, munching on it while shopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When someone asked for directions, she patiently explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After two hours of shopping, Diana finally arrived at the restaurant where she had agreed to meet Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was dressed in a light gray casual outfit, looking youthful and energetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt a bit tired after two hours of shopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She waited at the entrance for Alexander and spotted him approaching.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="431.html">« Prev</a><a href="433.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
