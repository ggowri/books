She saw Jean holding a gift box in her hand. Jean came to see Amelie, but now she was looking at Lily expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at her with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's cold eyes pained Jean, who apologized anxiously, "Mom, I...I was wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily glanced at her coldly. "Who's your mom? Are you blind? Your mom is inside. Don't call me Mom when you see me in the future. I told you last time that I was no longer your mother. Your mother is Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two conspired to kill me to make Amelie your mother. When you decided to kill me, I cut my ties with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not worthy of such a daughter as you. Remember this. When you see me next time, just pretend you don't know me. You have nothing to do with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I gotta go. I won't disturb the happy life of you and your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked up. It was a rare day as the sun was out. The warm sunlight was dazzling on the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she gave a confident and happy smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, her life began a new chapter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So what if she had no children? From now on, she would live for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean looked at her mother's relieved expression and knew that she had broken her heart. Her mother no longer wanted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Mom, I was wrong. I was wrong. Please forgive me. I was wrong. Dad went bankrupt, and we have nothing. Mom, don't you care about us anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was ignorant and made a small mistake. Mom, can you please forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean chased after Lily, but Lily didn't look back. Her ex-husband would have a big fight with Amelie soon. After this was over, she would take her parents on a trip abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean ran after Lily desperately, but in the end, her mother ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat in the snow and recalled how much her mother loved them, her heart aching and tears blurring her vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was in high school, she went out very early, and Lily got up at 6:00 to make breakfast for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she came home from school in the evening, Lily would make her favorite pork ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily arranged everything for her carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelie said that such days were too boring. She was a child, and children should enjoy themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie allowed them to play whatever they liked. Perhaps they were disciplined by Lily for too long, so they were pleased by Amelie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, Jean resented her mother. When Lily asked her to go to school, she skipped classes to see Amelie and asked her to take her to the playground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean was addicted to the indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she realized that Amelie wanted to ruin her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie wanted her son to inherit her father's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was truly good to her. In order to help her grow and learn better, Lily had always </span><span>accompanied her to study. Lily was impatient, but she forced herself to take the class for two hours with Jean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During Lily's absence, Jean missed her increasingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her mother would never forgive her for what she did to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little idiot, why are you sitting there? Get out of my house. Don't come here anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father used to be rich, so I coaxed you. I thought I would get your property after your parents divorced. I didn't expect your father to be so worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His company was robbed overnight, and you became a pauper. Why are you crying at my place? You're a jinx. Get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jean heard Amelie's angry voice, she stood up. Recalling Amelie called her little idiot, she smiled with tears. "I was stupid enough to believe you and drive my mother away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm stupid, but you ganged up with Jeff and stole my dad's company. I will ask Dad to settle this account with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not the end of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie was taken aback, a hint of fear flashing across her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark was cornered. If he learned about her relationship with Jeff, he would kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie glared at Jean fiercely and then turned around, entering the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean looked at the gift on the ground and found herself ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had hoped that Amelie would at least help her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she came with a gift to please Amelie. At least, she gotta take back her dad's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she heard those hurting words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was too stupid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jean stood up and braved the wind and snow, heading toward home step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother had taught her many life skills. Even if her mother was not around, and the family was broken, Jean believed she could support herself by working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to be excellent. She didn't want to let her mother down again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went to the company. Right after she turned on the computer, Luna said excitedly, "Diana, Jeff took the company from Mark. I got the news from the people watching over Amelie. Jeff went to see Amelie for the divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark went bankrupt, and Amelie was left with nothing. She finally got her retribution." Luna was delighted. Amelie was such a bad woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was not surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Queenie made a fuss, Jeff seized the opportunity and snatched away Mark's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three people finally turned themselves into enemies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This should be Lily's plan, and it was also a part of Paula's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula didn't send her ex-husband to jail because she knew what he cared about most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a man lost his money, he lost his dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark had been proud all his life, but suddenly, he became penniless. That was more painful than going to jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath and said helplessly, "I hate schemes, but I'm also in the schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff can't take the whole Foliot Group. Based on my knowledge of Lily, if she set up everything, Jeff will fall into a bigger trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark went bankrupt, and Jeff would leave Amelie alone. She had nothing now. What would become of her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps this was what Paula wanted to see the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this should have been planned jointly by Paula and Lily. At this moment, the two of them might be celebrating with champagne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was very excited. Jeff, that old scumbag, was finally going to get his comeuppance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm so curious. What is the trap?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="946.html">« Prev</a><a href="948.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
