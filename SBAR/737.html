Zion suggested after a moment's thought. "I'll send someone to pick you up to the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie could barely contain her excitement. "Perfect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, I'll take you home!" Zion offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had been waiting for precisely these words. With Zion personally escorting her, no one could doubt her innocence now!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched from a distance as Queenie got into Zion's car, her smile growing wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead, sweetheart. Hell's waiting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was practically gloating.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know she's the one headed for hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft voice came from behind her, quickly swallowed by the cold wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana spun around to face Steven. He stood there in his black coat, his handsome features looking even more striking than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice had been slightly husky, seeming to linger in her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's heart fluttered as she quickly stepped back. "What... what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be off comforting your lover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does this man keep popping up around me out of nowhere?" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, she's not my lover! You are!" Steven's gaze turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh please, you're all cut from the same cloth. Just stay out of my way, and I'll stay out of yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, she'd decided to mind her own business, only speaking up occasionally. And she was living well because of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Respecting the fate of others could bring good fortune to oneself.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked toward her car without another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched her retreating figure with helpless frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, news broke online about Queenie being signed by a top-tier agent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's profile had been caught on camera, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only fueled Queenie's rising popularity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the company, Diana saw Queenie trending on every major search engine.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she couldn't help but laugh - laugh with pure joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..." She could barely contain her excitement, feeling like setting off firecrackers in celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna stood in the doorway, giving her a skeptical look. "Diana, she's getting more famous by the day, and you're still laughing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the young girl's frustrated face and explained with a smile, "Luna, why so impatient? The real show hasn't even begun. The higher she climbs now, the harder she'll fall later."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't get you. If it were me, I'd have had her thrown in jail by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throwing her in prison would be too easy on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow and shot Luna a knowing look. "No, darling, prison would be far too merciful. Sure, she's riding high right now! That's just her luck. But what's coming for her will be so much worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She needs to taste every bit of suffering I went through. That's only fair."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "Lock her up? Three meals a day served to her, making her life nice and easy?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, out here, I can make her jump out of her skin every day. What's coming for her will make her break down a little more each day."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna shook her head slightly, baffled by this twisted logic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, would you prefer coffee or hot milk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hot milk, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she sat in her swivel chair, an unknown number flashed on her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Ms. Bishop. We're calling from the Fashion Association. The design competition you registered for begins in two weeks. Please ensure you're prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze. She knew nothing about it! "What? I never signed up for any competition!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="736.html">« Prev</a><a href="738.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
