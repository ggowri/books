He let the kidnappers destroy my face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The reason was simple. Because Queenie didn't like my face, so he asked the kidnappers to destroy me. It took me four days to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As a mother, you have never defended me. Brothers always look at me with contempt and are never friendly to me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, I understand. Your family is born bad. "</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was stunned. What Diana said sounded true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula said, "Diana, please don't say that. It was my fault. I didn't know that all of this was secretly planned by Queenie..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "No, you know these. But your heart is biased towards her, so you also think that I am from the countryside and will embarrass you. Queenie is indeed outstanding and has a good reputation in the circle. She is the decent lady of the Marsh family, kind and beautiful in appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although I am pretty, I am far less important than Queenie who you have carefully raised since she was a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's heart ached. She had thought so before, but later, she understood everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Diana... I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Can you come back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was full of hatred and surprised to hear Paula's words. "Come back? Where? I don't want to hear any more of your sarcasm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, leave her alone. Even if Queenie is wrong, Diana is vicious," Gale shouted angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula turned around and smiled coldly, "You are vicious. Diana did remind you, but you didn't believe it. You said she was vicious. But what you did to her was even more vicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will send you abroad today. I will not care about you in the future. Since you care so much about Queenie and your father, go to them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, why?" Gale was upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula laughed. "Why did we end up like this? Because you are as vicious as Queenie and Jeff. I have seen your nature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was struggling to support the company by myself, but you didn't give me the shares. Instead, you gave them to your father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gale, I have taught you since you were young, but you are still selfish. You have covered your own eyes and cannot see the pain of others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula pointed at the documents on the table, but before she could say anything, there was a noisy sound coming from the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, this is my cousin. His legs were broken while racing. It's a comminuted fracture. The doctor has given up, and he will be disabled for life. I know you can save him. Diana, please help him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom Cullen was Diana's friend. Diana appeared just when he was looking for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana met him at the elevator entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were from the same college but had the different mentors. They were friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom was developing his career abroad. And Diana had been busy these past few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at Tom, who was almost crying. People who were destined to be friends had similar personalities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were both very sympathetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was a little emotional, too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Calm down..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom held Diana's hand. His palms were sweaty. "Diana, I'm in a hurry. I don't trust other doctors to do the surgery. Can you do this surgery?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="232.html">« Prev</a><a href="234.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
