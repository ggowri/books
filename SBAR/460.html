Paula had been through so much, and instead of getting help, her four sons just kept causing trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke firmly, her tone laden with disappointment, "Mr. Eric Marsh, your mother has done everything for you four, treating you as the most precious parts of her life. And how have you all repaid her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The company is on the verge of collapse, the legacy your grandparents spent their lives building. Your mother's been fighting to save it, but she's outnumbered. Half the people here report to your dad and Queenie. Do you even know how much money they've siphoned from the company</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric frowned, defensive. "My father's a part of this family. What's wrong with him using company funds? Isn't it his money too?" He was angry, seeing Linda's loyalty to Paula as bias against his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda went silent for a moment, her expression hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was fierce and unyielding. If he supported Paula, they might stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only you could understand your mother's sacrifices. She's practically lived here at the office for three months, working day and night. And this is what you have to say? She was right about you four. You'll never see beyond yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was nothing but a master manipulator, and Paula's misfortune in marrying him was beyond unlucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick glance at her phone, Linda published the statement online. But the moment Eric turned away, she quietly withdrew it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every situation needed a bit of cleverness and strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's eyes widened, beginning to grasp the seriousness of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda's voice was steely. "Weren't you just talking about jumping off the building? I can escort you to the top floor if you need directions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stammered, taken aback. "Are you... encouraging me to kill myself?" A chill ran through him as he realized how resolute his mother truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a knock at the door interrupted the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in," Linda called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman entered, completely ignoring Eric, and spoke to Linda with an irritated tone. "Why wasn't the usual one million sent to Mr. Eric Marsh this month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda's gaze sharpened. This woman didn't even realize that the person standing right there was Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Funding for Mr. Eric Marsh's racing team has been </span><span>steady</span><span> for four years. But given the company's situation, where's the money supposed to come from now? I'll report this to Ms. Barnes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman scoffed, unimpressed. "Without that money, he'll raise a fuss, and only Ms. Marsh can calm him down. You should resolve this fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left, leaving Eric staring in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never asked for that kind of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Linda, his expression incredulous. "You're telling me I've been getting a million a month? I haven't seen a dime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linda's gaze was icy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Barnes has been giving you large monthly allowances, and you've also been requesting an extra million a month through finance. All of it came from her personal account. You've taken over forty million, and now you stand here claiming innocence? Eric, the truth about you four is becoming painfully clear."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="459.html">« Prev</a><a href="461.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
