This was going to be fun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Diana approached the elevator, someone suddenly covered her mouth with a cloth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A faint, familiar scent filled the air. It was the same toxin she had encountered in Woodston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's body went limp, and the man dragged her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The banquet had reached the cake-cutting ceremony, and Jace's children and grandchildren gathered around him to help slice the cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The guests sang birthday wishes, creating a warm and joyous scene that left everyone feeling envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The congratulations continued until a servant suddenly rushed over in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whispering into Jace's ear, the servant said, "Mr. Foliot, there's a young woman in the next room doing indecent things with a man. It's humiliating, and I had to inform you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His voice wasn't too loud or too soft. It was just enough for everyone nearby to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Queenie turned red with anger. "This is Mr. Foliot's birthday! Who dares to cause trouble at his banquet?" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie scanned the surroundings before turning toward Steven, then deliberately asked Paula, "Mom, where's Diana? I haven't seen her since she came in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you're doomed,"&nbsp;she thought smugly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula's heart sank when she heard this. Queenie was scheming against Diana again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze on Queenie darkened suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace's granddaughter, Novia, curiously asked, "Queenie, who is Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie smiled as she explained, "She's the adopted daughter of the Marsh family. My mom felt sorry for her and brought her home. She's here tonight, and we planned to introduce her to Mr. Foliot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace scoffed. "Just an adopted daughter? Forget it," implying his disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If someone's daring enough to behave indecently at my banquet, then let's see who it is," Jace said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace was furious; no one dared insult him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna stepped forward, blocking their path and staring directly at Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, the servant only mentioned someone being indecent. Why did you bring up Ms. Bishop's name? What's your intention?" Luna asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked around at the people and spoke softly, "I never said it was her. I was just worried she might not be comfortable at such a big event."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna ignored her, seeing through her act. She addressed the crowd calmly, "Everyone, my lady's last name is Bishop, and she has no connection to the Marsh family. The Marsh family deceived her for their gain, and Ms. Marsh is full of lies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie frowned. Luna had been absent earlier but suddenly emerged to block everyone, clearly with a purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was trying to buy time for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked pale and anxious, her vulnerable appearance stirring men's protective instincts. "Luna, there are people here who know Diana. If I'm lying, they can testify," she said, looking pitiful as she stood beside Jace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She appeared as if she were truly innocent of lying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope suddenly stepped forward, sneering, "Diana is indeed the Marsh family's adopted daughter. She's ruthless, always causing trouble wherever she goes. She's incredibly jealous. Queenie was only concerned for her, not implying she was being indecent with a man. So why are you blocking our way?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="197.html">« Prev</a><a href="199.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
