His facial features appeared blurry in the gloom, as if he were engulfed by a cloud of darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hand, hanging by his side, clenched tightly as his heart raced with anger and shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She actually knew about this!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Paula had already left the building and didn't see Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Paula was anxiously searching, she saw Diana coming out of the gate with red eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly walked over, desperate to explain, "Diana, just now I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mrs. Marsh, there's no need to explain anymore. It doesn't matter how you view me. Please refrain from calling me in the future. If you have any evidence, just call the police. I won't see you again!" Diana said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She added, "I'm fed up with your using my existence to showcase your nobility."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying her piece in a cold tone, Diana walked away without giving Paula a chance to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Paula spoke those hurtful words, she never once considered that Diana was her own biological daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula tried to catch up, but Diana's steps were fast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, please listen to me. What happened just now..." Paula tried to explain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I said there's no need for explanations. You can think whatever you want. Queenie is always better than me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have never fought for your love, in your eyes, everything I do is wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Furthermore, we have already signed the document to sever our family ties. I have been living in your house for a year, and I have given you money for my living expenses. If there is anything else I owe you, just tell me, and I will repay it all at once.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula saw the pain in her eyes and trembled. She opened her mouth, but no words came out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and said, "Oh! As a child, I still owe you some financial support. When you're old, please sue me in court, and whatever amount the court decides, I will pay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, that's not what I meant..." Paula tried to explain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned around and walked away, getting into a luxury car parked on the side of the road.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven went downstairs and met Queenie on the way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie saw Diana leaving in a luxury car and felt jealous. "Mom, Steven, how can Diana afford such a nice car? Is she resorting to selling herself after running out of options?" she exclaimed with envy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this remark, Paula, who was already feeling upset, angrily shouted, "Queenie, shut up! Isn't it because of you that she ended up like this? You came back, and Steven immediately wanted to divorce her. She signed the divorce agreement and left. Do you still have to maliciously scheme against her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was taken aback, looking at Paula with disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Is my mother... defending Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I... I'm also worried about Diana. After all, she is your biological daughter," Queenie said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Paula remained silent, her gaze fixed on Steven. She realized that he had also been involved in framing Diana along with Queenie, and she had misjudged him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly felt a sense of isolation and helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula recalled Diana's words that Queenie was the daughter of Jeff and his mistress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She decided to continue investigating the matter in person.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="50.html">« Prev</a><a href="52.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
