Your two friends are already here and enjoying it,&quot; the server informed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana paused for a moment, surprised that Steven had taken the initiative, even doing so in his capacity as her husband.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She invited the server in and took a look at the breakfast spread, her brows slightly furrowing. They had talked for quite a while yesterday, but it seemed Steven hadn&#x27;t fully absorbed what she said.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Turning away, she decided to eat. After all, it felt wasteful to let a meal go uneaten, especially breakfast.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once the server left, she sat down to a table full of steak, fruit, and eggs, a truly lavish breakfast.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Taking a deep breath, she began to eat, starting with the fluffy omelet, which was perfectly cooked and delicious.</p><p style="text-align:left;">For some reason, her mood brightened unexpectedly that morning.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, her phone buzzed with a text. It was from Paige.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Diana, I can&#x27;t thank Steven enough for this breakfast! This is the best meal I&#x27;ve ever had. It really warms my heart!]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana couldn&#x27;t help but smile: [Just one breakfast and you&#x27;re sold?]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Paige replied: [Not exactly, but I really do love this meal! The steak is so tender and tasty!]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Glancing at the marbled steak on her plate, Diana realized that Steven had prepared some for her as well.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Still, despite the delicious food, she felt a lingering sense of unease.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What if his kindness came with a hidden agenda?</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Enjoy your breakfast! I&#x27;ll join you soon. Let&#x27;s have one last day of fun before heading back tomorrow.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">She considered that she might leave tonight to visit Lily at the hospital.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as she was about to put her phone down, she noticed a call from Tom.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hey! Tom!&quot; she answered quickly, excitement bubbling up at the thought of Lily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, great news! Mrs. Foliot has woken up! You need to get here ASAP. She&#x27;s asking for you,&quot; Tom said, his voice filled with energy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt relief wash over her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;That&#x27;s fantastic! Tell her not to worry. I&#x27;ll be there in about an hour. In the meantime, can you do a full check-up on her? If everything looks good, prepare some soft food for her to regain her strength.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sure, take your time. Drive safe,&quot; Tom reassured her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sure! I&#x27;ll treat you to lunch when I arrive!&quot; she teased.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Wow, it&#x27;s tough to get you for a lunch date! I&#x27;ll handle the plans, so don&#x27;t rush. I&#x27;ll keep Mrs. Foliot calm in the meantime,&quot; he replied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sounds good!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After finishing her breakfast, Diana packed her suitcase and encouraged Althea and Paige to enjoy themselves while she arranged for Luna to drive her to the hospital.</p><p style="text-align:left;">An hour later, she arrived at the hospital.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She asked Luna to wait downstairs and headed straight to Lily&#x27;s room. When she walked in, she saw Lily had already had her breakfast and was resting comfortably.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily&#x27;s face lit up as she saw Diana. &quot;Diana, you&#x27;re here!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her voice was thick with emotion, and her eyes glistened with gratitude as she realized Diana was the one who had saved her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana approached and sat on the edge of the bed. &quot;Don&#x27;t be sad, Mrs. Foliot. The fact that you woke up is the greatest gift.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Thank you!&quot; Lily smiled, her eyes sparkling with appreciation. &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for you, I know I wouldn&#x27;t have made it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Although her left leg was still immobile, it had been saved, though there might be some lasting effects. Thankfully, she still had the use of her limbs, unlike when she had crawled out of that basement, her feet completely numb.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Now isn&#x27;t the right time for revenge. Amelie and Mr. Foliot are framing me, claiming I killed you. They&#x27;ll keep coming after me for at least three more days. Can we hold off on exposing their plot for now?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lily was taken aback, shocked that they would frame Diana. &quot;How can anyone believe such twisted lies?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="807.html">« Prev</a><a href="809.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
