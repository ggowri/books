Diana agreed, happy to coexist peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll agree, but don't tell anyone I'm your wife. To the world, Queenie is your fianc&eacute;e, and I don't want to be called a homewrecker."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not a homewrecker," Steven insisted firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at the time; he had finished his work for the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned down and suddenly kissed Diana softly on her rosy lips, which were still flushed from her earlier exercise, vibrant like a sunset.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze for a moment, but Steven had already lifted his head to gaze at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her dazed expression made him want to protect her fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full, inviting lips were tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing what had happened, Diana quickly wiped her mouth and shot him a glare. "Stay away from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her warning only amused Steven, who found her reaction adorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana left to find Althea and Paige, and Steven didn't stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea and Paige were waiting just outside the door. When they saw Diana emerge, they breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea hurried over. "Diana, how did you get out? Are you okay? Did Steven hurt you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head, spinning around to show she was fine. "No, he can't hurt me anymore. Don't worry; let's keep having fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea hesitated, then spoke sheepishly, "Diana, there's a boxing gym on the basement level. I know you're not a fan of muscular guys, so why don't you stay here and watch the kids? Paige and I want to check it out since it's a rare opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana laughed at her. "Do you really like those muscle-bound men?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!" Paige chimed in, nodding eagerly. "You prefer mature and composed types, while we love those ripped guys. The hotel manager just told us the show starts in ten minutes, and the best part is, there are some really handsome fighters this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana watched their excitement, feeling a bit disinterested. "Alright, alright, you two go ahead. I'll take care of the baby, no need to worry about him."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Althea grinned. "Diana, you don't have to fuss too much. The nanny will be here, and during her meal time, you can just check on him. After all, he's your nephew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Althea and Paige left, chatting and giggling about which abs looked the best.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head slightly at their retreating figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone has their preferences; she favored slender male models, while they preferred muscular men.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia shared a similar taste with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked over and knocked on the door. The nanny opened it, and Diana suggested she go have lunch while she took care of the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cradled Althea's son, who carried the family name and was named Harlan Jonathan. Althea hoped her child would grow up to have a vibrant and joyful life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harlan, I am taking care of you, so no crying."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Diana finished speaking, Steven's door opened. She happened to be searching for her card in her bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the door, Diana turned to look at Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her with the baby took Steven by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This child belonged to Althea.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the night at the hotel, when Althea and Gale had been together. That night, Queenie accused Althea and Diana of plotting against Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he guessed this child was Gale and Althea's.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is Althea's child?" Steven asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression instantly turned cold. "Yes. Gale was a rapist that night. We didn't scheme against him; that was your darling Queenie and Penelope. Queenie deliberately had Penelope get close to Gale to irritate him, and he fell right into their trap, crazily in love with Penelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Althea should have reported it. What happened that night was Gale dragging her in, but to you all, it seems no one wants to listen to our side. You berated me, calling me shameless for plotting against my own brother."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="785.html">« Prev</a><a href="787.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
