You might not be fully aware of what happened before. We've done some digging on Ms. Bishop. She acquired the company through legitimate means. </span><span>Y</span><span>ou sure your information is accurate?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If </span><span>it</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> false, once it hits the internet, it could seriously affect Ms. Marsh, damage your reputation, and impact small companies like ours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Dylan was abroad, Queenie often kept in touch with him, saying Diana was malicious and blaming her for everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, their feud had turned into a deep-seated grudge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan despised Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan shouted, "That's right, everything is true. I can vouch for it personally. Diana used underhanded means to get the company. She</span><span> </span><span>destroys families. When she couldn't have Steven, she schemed to take his assets instead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reporter was thrilled. This was headline news.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing their interest piqued, Dylan began to eagerly list all of Diana's alleged crimes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The morning sunlight streamed in brightly. Steven opened his eyes, taking in the familiar room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt at ease. He had slept well last night, without any dreams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, he realized something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking down at Diana still asleep in his arms, he let out a helpless smile. She slept like a child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last night, she had rolled into his arms again on her own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven might have improper thoughts about her, but he would never take advantage of her in a situation like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana slept well and woke up early. She opened her eyes to see Steven's smiling gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She froze for a moment, staring blankly at Steven for a while before realizing she was in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let out a startled scream and quickly pulled away from Steven's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had no idea how she ended up rolling into Steven's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt like these days were taking her back to the time when she used to take care of Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Steven had injured his leg. After his surgery, she got him ridiculously expensive medicine and spent most of her days massaging his leg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, Steven resisted it. He always felt like his life was over, drowning in pain every single day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pushed everyone away. Helen hired several caregivers for him, but he drove them all off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Diana stepped in to take care of him herself. Being a doctor, it didn&rsquo;t feel like much of a hassle for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, Steven couldn&rsquo;t see, but his hearing was sharp. The moment he heard the door open, he&rsquo;d lose it, yelling at her, "Get out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn&rsquo;t leave. At that moment, she just thought Steven was pitiful&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t a single person who truly cared about him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She encouraged him, telling him that with surgery and consistent medication, his leg could heal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing hope, he stopped getting angry, and she was able to get close to him, massaging him every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t until Steven gradually regained feeling in his leg that he finally calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana felt exhausted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the scorching summer, she massaged his leg, sweat dripping from her forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cared for him tirelessly, rain or shine, until he finally recovered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then Queenie came back. The peaceful time was shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Diana was truly confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Diana who had faced death wasn&rsquo;t confident anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, to her, safety and love couldn&rsquo;t coexist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said to Steven, "Steven, I&rsquo;ve made peace with our relationship. Once your leg and injuries are healed, you should come back. I need to leave this place for a while."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven paused slightly and asked, "Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana sat across from him, smiling. "I want to travel. And if I meet someone who makes my heart race, I&rsquo;d like to fall in love too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said domineeringly, "Diana, you&rsquo;re still my wife. And you&rsquo;re thinking about dating other men?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana didn&rsquo;t care at all. "We&rsquo;ll get divorced eventually. And you&rsquo;ll meet a girl you love too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;ve seen you at your lowest. We can only be strangers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;ll find someone genuine someday, someone who truly cares about me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven watched Diana&rsquo;s hopeful expression. She really didn&rsquo;t love him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had hurt her too deeply, that&rsquo;s why she had thoughts like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her intently and said, "There&rsquo;s still a year left until our agreement. During this year, you can&rsquo;t betray me, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to fall in love with me again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was almost trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "I met you when I was seventeen, and I really, really liked you. I remember being so happy the night I knew I&rsquo;d marry you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn&rsquo;t sleep all night, hoping you&rsquo;d love me. But Steven, your heart is too cold. </span><span>When</span><span> Queenie came back, I knew we should divorce. I stopped hoping anything from you. You just kept hurting me. I finally gave up. Now, I&rsquo;m helping you</span><span> for </span><span>a smooth divorce."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had truly let go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sometimes, seeing Steven smile still made Diana&rsquo;s heart flutter&mdash;and ache.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the 24-year-old Diana was no longer the 17-year-old Diana. The passion she once had was gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt a sharp pain in his chest. Her saying something like this wasn&rsquo;t unexpected, but it still hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's face turned pale. She had let go because he wasn&rsquo;t the one who pushed her back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had been the one, with her personality, she would&rsquo;ve made sure he paid&mdash;maybe even with his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt like he was plunging into an abyss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A massive wave of grief swallowed him whole, fierce and unrelenting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly collapsed into Diana's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She jumped in shock, staring at Steven's pale face in her arms. Gently patting his cheek, she said, "Steven, what's wrong? Wake up, please."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana checked him over. Steven had fainted from sheer exhaustion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Steven and murmured, "Steven, did my words really shake you up this much?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1052.html">« Prev</a><a href="1054.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
