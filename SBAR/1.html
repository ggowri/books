The family she'd spent her whole life protecting had actually wanted her dead all along...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the days leading up to her death, Diana's world had crumbled around her:</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Four days before, Gale, her oldest brother, let the kidnappers mess up her pretty face, all to make them spare Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Three days out, Frank, the second brother, begged them to break Diana's hands instead of hurting Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two days before it all ended, Eric, brother number three, asked the kidnappers to interject an excruciatingly painful poison on Diana instead of Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The day before she died, Dylan, the youngest brother, told the kidnappers they could break Diana's legs if it meant Queenie would be okay.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All this time, Diana was four months pregnant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, when she was in the depths of her agony, her family arrived. But it was Steven, the man she had loved above all others, who delivered the final blow. To save Queenie, he pushed Diana from the building.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana died, her body beyond recognition, she finally felt relieved from the pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, her soul could not leave this world and kept floating among her family for decades, witnessing the end of everyone!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was not until the day Steven Gellar died that she felt completely relieved. Her soul had been wandering for decades, unable to reincarnate, and she didn't know why. Now that Steven was dead, the resentment in her heart had also disappeared. She wanted to go somewhere else. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana took one last look at Steven's photo and walked towards the entrance of the villa without any reluctance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon touching the door, she glimpsed a white light, freeing her from Steven's hold on her soul.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the next second, she was pulled back by a force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah!" Diana screamed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She tried to pull at something but failed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, drop the act! Get up! How dare you kidnap Queenie? How could you be so vicious!" A cold voice came from above her head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana instantly opened her eyes and stared at the handsome man in front of her in a daze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven? Why would he be here?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Damn! Diana turned furious. Steven just died, and his soul still caught up with her?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Diana, you are so vicious. How dare you hire someone to kidnap Queenie? How could I marry such a cruel woman like you? Don't pretend that you&rsquo;re innocent. Get up and sign the divorce agreement! Since you've taken care of me for two years, I will let it slide this time, but we have to get a divorce!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Divorce?" Diana, who was still dizzy, looked at the furious Steven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at the surrounding environment again, which was familiar.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly realized something!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was reborn?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was brought back to Queenie's birthday party years ago: Queenie framed her, saying that Diana had hired someone to kidnap her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hence, Steven gave her a divorce agreement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Also, the Marsh family, her biological parents, and her four brothers gave her a letter of severance of parentage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in her past life, she had been in love and couldn't give up Steven, whom she had rescued from death.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, she refused to sign the divorce agreement and begged to stay. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Six months later, when she was pregnant, Steven pushed her off that building. Just thinking about it now makes her heart ache. It's like a gut punch every time she remembers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was the granddaughter of old man Leopold Bishop. She recalled the moment her spirit floated&nbsp;out of her body and saw her grandpa, who loved her dearly, completely break down when he saw her dead body. Hearing him call her a "waste" was a real shock. Her grandpa had never said anything hurtful to her before, so he must have been incredibly disappointed and devastated to speak about her like that. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her heart broke completely, she blamed herself for letting down the ones who really loved her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Reborn, she finally understood that if someone didn't love her, no matter how much she gave, he wouldn't appreciate it! In this life, she would never fall in love with Steven again and would concentrate on her career as a rich lady.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The first thing to do after rebirth was refuse to make any sacrifice for these ungrateful scums. She would bully back those who had bullied her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had just sorted out the matter when she heard an angry voice in her ear. "Diana, the Marsh family will not have a daughter as vicious as you. In front of all the guests, we now announce that we no longer have any ties with you from now on. This is a severance agreement, sign it now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana looked at her furious father, Jeff Marsh, who was holding the letter of severance in his hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She then glanced at Queenie, who was busy weeping and looking pitiful, and her mother who was shooting her resentful glares, and her four brothers, who looked like they wanted to eat her alive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn't afford such &ldquo;affection&rdquo; from the Marsh family. </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled sadly and turned to Jeff. "Okay! I'll sign it!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="0.html">« Prev</a><a href="2.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
