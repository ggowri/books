Diana had been gone for three days.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven stood up and looked out the window. He lowered his eyes and lost himself in thought.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today was the third day. Diana was preparing to return. After dinner, Diana planned to travel back overnight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to have dinner with Althea before leaving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was eating lobster meat and looking at her phone. She saw that Queenie was still the lead actress in Bright Night.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea was shocked. "Oh my gosh, Diana, what kind of magic did Queenie use on Jace? Today, they announced that she is still the lead actress. They said the incident was just a small fight between you two.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They said you were the one who made a mistake. There are even some articles saying you framed Queenie. The worst part is that your dad did a livestream saying you left because you were flirting with a man, but he didn't say who."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled calmly, "Queenie has very good luck."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was expected.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She added, "Althea, I'm fine. Don't worry about me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea knew she would fight back and didn't need to worry. But Queenie was too evil. "Diana, be careful when you go back."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "Okay."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked down and ate her grilled fish. "Wow. This fish is so tender."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana happily ate her food. She would think about how to deal with Queenie when she got back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea pushed the octopus toward Diana. "This is your favorite. Eat more."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana told her, "Althea, I put a lot in the fridge. Remember to eat some every day."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea replied, "Diana, I can't eat much."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her appetite had been small since she got pregnant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Then save it for your mother when she comes in a few days. I've already taken a lot back with me, a whole big box."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea sighed, "Alright. I don't want you to leave. When you're here, I forget all my worries."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana thought for a moment and said, "I'll go back and take care of the company first. I'll come back to be with you when you give birth. Just call me when you feel something, and I'll come right away."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Althea replied, "Okay. Diana, you must come. Not for the baby, but for me. I won't be with Tobias anymore. If I meet someone I like in the future, I'll get married again. But I'll love my child even more. I won't let one bad man ruin my love life."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt relieved.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying goodbye to Althea, she caught the last ferry and got home at eleven.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She put the seafood in the fridge and went upstairs to take a bath. After washing up, she lay down on the bed. She was tired from being at sea for the past few days. She lay in the soft blankets, listening to the wind howling outside.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was getting colder. She pulled the blanket up to her shoulders and felt warm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, her phone chimed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She checked it out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil had sent her a message and a video.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil: [Diana, this is how Queenie kept her lead role. Jace came out looking very satisfied. He's old but strong.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana watched the video. Queenie went in first, and about ten minutes later, Jace followed. They stayed inside for quite a while before coming out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Cecil didn't capture the most important part because he arrived late.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "This kind of video doesn't prove anything."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had thought a lot over the past three days. She would step back and stay behind the scenes. This way, she could relax and secretly investigate Queenie.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil: [Diana, I was late yesterday and didn't get much useful video. If there's a first time, there will be a second time. I'll catch the scene.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana: [Her computer skills are better than yours. You could be counterattacked at any time.]</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil: [Diana, there's a party in three days. Are you going?]</p><div class="pagination"><a href="324.html">« Prev</a><a href="326.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
