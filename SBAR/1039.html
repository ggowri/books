And in their training program, he was the top student. No one could beat him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just one move from Nick had him writhing in sharp pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan roared, "You didn&rsquo;t even warn me before making a move! If I had been ready, there&rsquo;s no way you would&rsquo;ve won."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick looked at his bravado and chuckled. "How dare you say something like that? Anyone trained can sense danger. But you? You&rsquo;re useless. </span><span>Anyway</span><span>, I&rsquo; give you credit&mdash;you&rsquo;ve mastered the art of being a pain in the ass."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He looks down on me!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his fingers hurt too much, tonight wasn&rsquo;t the night for another fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, let&rsquo;s call it a night. Things aren&rsquo;t in our favor right now. But we&rsquo;ll have our chance. As long as I&rsquo;m here, I won&rsquo;t let anyone bully you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie shot a sharp glare at Diana and threatened, "Diana, just wait. As the CEO of the Gellar Group, you let your boy toy attack someone in a restaurant. How are you going to explain that to the public?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned, thinking, "</span><span>T</span><span>his is </span><span>her move?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this will only bring her fatal consequences! She&rsquo;ll just meet her end even faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead, release the news. I&rsquo;ll tell the public why I hit you. Years ago, you and Dylan drove two pianists to their deaths. If that hits the top, life</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s gonna be</span><span> pretty hard for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Dylan and Queenie with a bright, mocking smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She remembered her past life, when this came to light, Dylan willingly went to prison for Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan and Queenie&rsquo;s bond really runs deep, doesn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana still remembered how Dylan had her beaten to the brink of ruin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not a single member of the Marsh family ever truly cared for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her sincerity was met with nothing but silence. After she broke free from the Marsh family&rsquo;s three sons, Dylan came back to haunt her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was taken aback. His mind drifted to that girl.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned, thinking, "She couldn&rsquo;t handle the pressure. How is that our fault?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, I just wanted Queenie to win first place, so I warned </span><span>her</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>S</span><span>he jumped off the building and killed herself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We were just trying to scare her. Her death has nothing to do with us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But... how could there be two pianists?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, don't accuse us. That girl's death has nothing to do with us. She chose to jump. How could I have stopped her from dying?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so?" Diana looked at Dylan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze was too clear, too cold. It sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;how had her eyes become so terrifying?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Y</span><span>ou two threatened them with those thugs countless times. Even after you left, Queenie sent one of them back to assault her. That&rsquo;s why she jumped. The autopsy report clearly states she was assaulted before her death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, </span><span>you think </span><span>it&rsquo;s</span><span> over</span><span>? </span><span>Still</span><span> remember the girl who was bullied into suicide by you? If not mistaken, she played the piano better than you too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your talent and fame were built on the lives of others."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened to Callie was bad, but what you did to the other girl? That&rsquo;s even worse! You&rsquo;re nothing short of monsters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, you </span><span>really</span><span> think Penelope took the fall for you, you&rsquo;re off the hook, do you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you..." Queenie stammered, too furious to form a sentence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her scandals had been exposed time and time again, yet she always managed to come out clean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the police couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">How could Diana possibly have any?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie let out a cold laugh. "Diana, if you really had evidence, you&rsquo;d have handed it over to the police. </span><span>Still waiting</span><span> this long?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled. "Queenie, </span><span>not funny enough</span><span> if you went to jail. But don&rsquo;t worry. When the time is right, I&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re sent straight in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chilly spring breeze swept through. In that moment, Queenie felt a coldness seep through her entire body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t know how much evidence Diana had, but everything she could think of, she had already taken care of in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would never let Diana frame her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine! Diana, I&rsquo;ll wait for that day. I&rsquo;m curious, how much evidence do you have to send both of us to jail?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Queenie turned to Dylan. "Dylan, let me take you to the hospital</span><span>,</span><span> get your finger bandaged first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he felt a sharp pain. He shot a fierce glare at Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, just you wait. I won&rsquo;t let you off. You tore my family apart, and I&rsquo;ll make you pay for it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan grabbed Queenie and stormed off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was furious. "Diana, has Dylan lost his mind? He knows the truth, yet he&rsquo;s still helping Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a bitter laugh. The dull ache in her heart was overwhelming. "Luna, some people are just that heartless. They may look human, but they&rsquo;re worse than beasts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan is the cruelest of the four brothers. He&rsquo;s just as bad as Queenie. He&rsquo;d even die for her if it came to that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Some people are so stubborn, they only believe what they see and refuse to trust anyone else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan only believes Queenie, the one he&rsquo;s spoiled since they were kids. He&rsquo;ll always favor her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plenty of people genuinely care about Queenie, but she doesn&rsquo;t appreciate it. She just uses them as stepping stones."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna, Nick, and Barry were all furious, but Diana&rsquo;s mood was slowly calming down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let&rsquo;s go. </span><span>H</span><span>ead home," Diana said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said those words on purpose</span><span>. Dylan would definitely make a move before Queenie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He might be the perfect pawn for Queenie, but he&rsquo;s also a ticking bomb ready to blow her up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana lowered her gaze, hiding her sly smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric quickly returned to Paula&rsquo;s house, watching her and Gale discussing the kids.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also knew Gale and Althea had a son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had something important. "</span><span>Paula</span><span>, Gale. Dylan&rsquo;s back, but Queenie tricked him. </span><span>T</span><span>hey ran into Diana at the restaurant. Then, they got into a fight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula was furious. "Forget about Dylan. He won&rsquo;t wake up unless he faces the consequences. Out of you four brothers, he&rsquo;s the most spiteful. You already told him it&rsquo;s all because of Queenie and Jeff, but he still wouldn&rsquo;t listen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had made up her mind. Even if she lost a son, it didn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan&rsquo;s spitefulness would only shave years off her life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric felt upset. "</span><span>A</span><span>re we just watch</span><span>ing</span><span> him?</span><span> N</span><span>o</span><span>t do something?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula laughed, "Eric, you think you can stop Dylan?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1038.html">« Prev</a><a href="1040.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
