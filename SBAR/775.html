She thought, "Why was he angry? And why had he accused me of having my intelligence offline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the lounge, the four bodyguards delivered a barrage of blows to the two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lay on the ground, gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Diana remembered one of the men mentioning a payment of one million dollars. She recalled Steven's modus operandi; when he wanted to deal with her, he used his bodyguards, no need for outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She calmed herself and waited for the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven sighed in relief at her sudden composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been with her for two years and knew she was smart, quick to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at the men on the ground, demanding, "Tell me, who sent you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men could barely breathe after the beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's voice boomed over them, startling them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men remained silent. Steven ordered the bodyguards, "Keep going until they talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beating resumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven didn't call it off until one of the men begged for mercy and agreed to reveal the mastermind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's voice, cold and brimming with anger, boomed like thunder. "Speak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face was a mask of blood. He didn't dare look at Steven; instead, he turned to Diana. "It was a woman. We usually communicated online. She couldn't stand some girls' arrogance and paid us to humiliate them. We never met her. After each task, we sent her photos, and she left the money in a designated spot. We don't know who she is."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pressed for confirmation. "You're saying the other party is a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nodded vigorously. "Yes, a woman, but I've never seen her. We talked through the internet."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was puzzled. "You've never met her, so how do you know she's a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a man, and the way she talks sounds like a woman. If you don't believe me, you can check the messages on my phone."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man handed his phone to Diana, his hands shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana crouched to read the messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Diana is in the presidential suite at Baison Mall, room 608. Ruin her. One million dollars. Remember to take photos.]</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes glinted with a murderous intent. The sender's phone number was an elongated string of digits, clearly employing some form of sophisticated encryption technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew it had to be Queenie if it was a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly dialed Queenie's number, warning everyone, "Not a sound."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Diana, you're not dead yet?" Queenie's arrogant voice came through the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's heart sank. That tone confirmed her suspicion. "Queenie, I cleared your name, and this is how you repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Feeling violated, Diana? You deserve it. You're just a stepping stone for me. Those two men were hired by Steven. He hates you, so he just wanted to insult you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie burst into a wild, unrestrained laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hung up swiftly. She glared at Steven, whose deep eyes startled her, yet she said, "Steven, you still say it wasn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in her eyes. She mused silently, "If he hated me, he should divorce me. I wouldn't bother him anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven never expected Queenie to regularly throw such accusations at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome features contorted with a wild, bloodthirsty viciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing near him, Diana felt a chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he called Queenie.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="774.html">« Prev</a><a href="776.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
