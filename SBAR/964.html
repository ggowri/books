She didn&#x27;t even have dinner. Queenie and George were off enjoying their own time alone.</p><p>As for her useless son, no one knew where he&#x27;d gone.</p><p>Mark had also abandoned her after Jeff took over the company.</p><p>She once dreamed of a joyful, wealthy family, but now it had turned into a joke. She was left alone.</p><p>Sitting in the living room, she gazed around at the empty house, feeling like she was back to many years ago, waiting for Jeff to return with gifts and money.</p><p>But now, even he had drifted away from her.</p><p>The phone on the table suddenly chimed.</p><p>The screen lit up, showing a video message. She stared blankly at the phone, sluggishly realizing someone had sent her a message.</p><p>She opened the video and saw Jeff buying luxury goods for another woman.</p><p>This was the day she had longed for, but Jeff had given it to another woman.</p><p>She had been too greedy. If she had known Jeff would make a comeback, she never would have been with Mark.</p><p>Then she saw the message that followed, and her body shook with rage.</p><p>She growled, &quot;Jeff, I waited for you for over 20 years. How could you do this to me? I&#x27;ve suffered so much for you, and now you&#x27;re out there with another woman, buying her luxury gifts. How dare you?&quot;</p><p>She glanced at the number and realized it was Paula.</p><p>Paula did this on purpose.</p><p>She laughed bitterly, the irony overwhelming her.</p><p>Paula, a defeated foe, had sent her such a message.</p><p>Amelie felt that if she couldn&#x27;t have a good Christmas, no one else would either.</p><p>Without hesitation, she dialed Paula&#x27;s number.</p><p>Paula knew Amelie would call. It was time for her to learn the hard truth.</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Paula, you&#x27;re a defeated loser. How dare you send me a message mocking me? Don&#x27;t you care about losing face?&quot;</p><p>She had watched Paula suffer.</p><p>Betrayed by the one she loved most was the most painful.</p><p>Amelie just regretted not getting her hands on what Paula owned.</p><p>Paula smiled indifferently, her fingers brushing over the luxurious gown in front of her. &quot;Amelie, I&#x27;ve been doing business since I was 18. Do you think I would lose? Am I your defeated foe?</p><p>&quot;Amelie, you&#x27;re not even qualified to make me lose.</p><p>&quot;The company Queenie got is nothing but a shell, and she gave me 500 million dollars more, so I could solve the office building problem.</p><p>&quot;As for your son, his overseas company is now mine. I&#x27;m filthy rich now, and you&#x27;ve got nothing.</p><p>&quot;Want to take everything from me? Dream on, Amelie.</p><p>&quot;Now you have nothing. Your son and daughter have abandoned you because you&#x27;re useless to them.</p><p>&quot;Jeff left you because you&#x27;re cheap and self-destructive. He was always a man of his word. He promised you everything, and for years, he worked hard to earn money and provide for you. But you were never satisfied. You were always eyeing more, and when you saw Jeff falter, you jumped into Mark&#x27;s arms.</p><p>&quot;Jeff has given up on you. Mark abandoned you when he lost the company to Jeff. Now, you&#x27;re left all alone, just like I wanted.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;ve finally fallen from grace.</p><p>&quot;For years, you&#x27;ve lived the life of a rich person, enjoying my money. But from now on, your life will be an endless hell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Amelie could hardly believe it. Her chest felt tight, and her heart was sinking with immense pain.</p><p>Anger suffocated her, making it hard to breathe.</p><p>&quot;Impossible. How could you be the one who set us up? You schemed against my son&#x27;s company too?&quot; Amelie screamed in agony.</p><p>&quot;How could you know our plan? How?&quot; Amelie screamed.</p><p>She had once dreamed of being a rich wife, enjoying all the wealth Paula had, but now, it was all gone.</p><p>Paula smiled and said, &quot;Heaven must have pitied me. It allowed me to know your plan, so I set you up first. But this isn&#x27;t the end, Amelie. For everything you&#x27;ve done to me, I will take back what&#x27;s mine.&quot;</p><p>And then, Paula hung up the phone.</p><p>Amelie laughed bitterly, but it was a laugh of collapse.</p><p>She shook her head in disbelief. She had thought she had successfully schemed against Paula, but now she realized she was the real fool.</p><p>She had celebrated when Queenie took over Paula&#x27;s company, thinking her dreams had finally come true.</p><p>But Queenie didn&#x27;t make a single penny, and the company&#x27;s core team had all left. Queenie had even lost 500 million dollars in the process.</p><p>Amelie laughed bitterly, her tears streaming as she screamed in pain.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t believe everything had been set up by Paula.</p><p>Paula&#x27;s goal had been simple—to shatter all her dreams and leave her with nothing.</p><p>Paula had succeeded. Now Amelie truly had nothing.</p><p>Jeff seemed to have succeeded, but it might not be the truth.</p><p>She no longer felt angry or sorrowful because now she knew Jeff was going to face the same fate as her.</p><p>Amelie cried loudly, her sobs drowning in the sound of fireworks outside.</p><p>There was a loud knock at the door.</p><p>Amelie froze, her crying stopping immediately.</p><p>No one would be knocking at this hour.</p><p>Wiping her tears, she stood up and went to open the door, only to find two unfamiliar men standing outside.</p><p>She stepped back in fear. &quot;Who are you? What do you want?&quot;</p><p>The man at the front, a heavyset figure, looked at her. &quot;Are you Amelie?&quot;</p><p>Terrified, Amelie nodded. &quot;Yes, I am. What do you want from me?&quot;</p><p>The man smiled faintly, &quot;Then we&#x27;ve come to the right person. You&#x27;re coming with us now.&quot;</p><p>Amelie was overwhelmed with fear. She could tell the two men had bad intentions.</p><p>&quot;What do you want from me? It&#x27;s Christmas. Where are you taking me?&quot; she shouted.</p><p>The man sneered, &quot;What do we want? You&#x27;ll find out when we get there. You better come with us, or we&#x27;ll make you come.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="963.html">« Prev</a><a href="965.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
