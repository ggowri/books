"Evan, your IQ seems to be plummeting. Do you really think that old fox would keep such important information on his phone? He's sleeping with a different woman every other night; why would he risk leaving crucial files on his phone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt disgusted even sitting at the same table with Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought back to his own grand proposal, only to become the same kind of man as Andrew, spending every night out on the town.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The irony was, he hated Andrew, yet he ended up walking the same path.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He neglected his wife while showering women outside with a monthly allowance of five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed his eyes, a bitter taste filling his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had sown the seeds of this bitter fruit, and now he had to reap what he had sown.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We wait," he finally said after a long silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan understood. Waiting was their only option now. He knew about that person's existence, but there was no way to track that person down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie kept making scenes, embarrassing herself more and more. Sooner or later, she'd slip up and show her true colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to catch her red-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While some cried and others schemed, Diana's laughter rang out as Queenie's tears fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Online, the drama between her and Levi was getting more heated. Everyone was standing up for Steven, while she had become the target of public scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just tried calling Levi, but he hung up on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that Levi, ignoring my calls like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Queenie was fuming, her eyes red with anger, Eric walked in with the milkshake he'd bought for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Eric irritated her even more. With a cold smirk, she walked over and slapped him across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You useless piece of trash! All you can do is run errands. You're just in my way, completely useless, good for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the dangerous glint in Eric's eyes from the slap, he maintained his fawning demeanor. "Queenie, what's wrong? I know I'm not worth much, but I'm trying my best to help. You wanted a milkshake, so I went right out to get it. Look how heavy the snow is outside. Remember when we were kids? I used to brave the snow just like this to buy you a milkshake..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't bring up the past. You're pathetic, following me around like a loyal puppy, hurting Diana until she was black and blue. I don't need you anymore, but I suppose you can stick around like the dog you are.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to kill Diana. I'll pay you ten thousand dollars a month. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled, "Queenie, murder is illegal. If I get caught and rat you out, do you think you'd get away with it? You're pregnant, and your emotions are all over the place. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear what you just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, drink up. It's your favorite."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric handed her the milkshake with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took it coldly, stuck in the straw, and took a sip. Her mood improved slightly, but she still shot Eric an icy glance. "Eric, everyone who wants to stay by my side needs to prove their worth. Both Gale and Frank are willing to hurt Diana for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know what Gale did for me? He hired some thugs to go after Diana, to destroy her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frank trashed Diana's reputation for my sake. You've done some things for me too, but nothing compared to what Gale and Frank have done. Why don't you do something to hurt Diana as well? Prove to me that you're truly loyal to me as your sister. Show me that Diana is the sister you hate most!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's eyes gleamed with malice, her smile venomous like a snake's - unsettling and chilling to the bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric felt a mix of heartache and fury. He'd never underestimated how poisonous this woman could be, but hearing these things from her mouth still left him stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Queenie, that year when I had that high fever and almost died, it wasn't really a fever or flu, was it? I was poisoned, wasn't I?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="718.html">« Prev</a><a href="720.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
