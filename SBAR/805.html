How have you been? Enjoying yourself?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana thought of Steven outside and felt a knot of tension in her stomach.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She hadn&#x27;t expected to run into him, and now she couldn&#x27;t shake him off.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s been okay. Just make sure to cover your tracks. Queenie is ruthless. If she catches even a hint of what you&#x27;re doing, she&#x27;ll suspect you in no time, and you could be in real danger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie&#x27;s underground company is filled with sharp minds. Give me a little more time, and I&#x27;ll expose them all. Then you can continue your investigation.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had a real talent for winning people over, and she knew how to manipulate those around her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In Diana&#x27;s previous life, Joseph had helped Queenie achieve her ambitions, yet he ultimately faced a tragic fate. This time, Diana had reached out to Joseph early, oblivious to the fact that someone else had already fallen victim to Queenie&#x27;s schemes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She could save one person, but she couldn&#x27;t save them all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna chuckled, &quot;Diana, I&#x27;ve been on her trail for quite some time. I know what I&#x27;m doing, so don&#x27;t worry. Just enjoy yourself, and I&#x27;ll call you as soon as I have any news.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Okay!&quot; Diana hung up, sitting on her bed, still reeling from the shock of Steven&#x27;s revelation about Queenie.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It felt surreal, almost like a cruel joke.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A knock on the door startled her, and she turned to see Steven&#x27;s tall figure standing in the doorway.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why haven&#x27;t you left yet?&quot; she asked, frowning.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her cold tone made Steven squint slightly, a dangerous glint in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He pushed the door open, stepped inside, and sat down at the edge of the bed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before Diana could even rise, he was already at her side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The anger radiating from him was palpable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What do you want?&quot; she asked, her voice laced with defensiveness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She planned to pack her things and leave first thing in the morning.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven sat close, his arms wrapping firmly around her waist, pulling her into his embrace.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana bristled at the contact. Here they were, on the brink of divorce, yet he insisted on being so close.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Gellar, this isn&#x27;t right. We&#x27;re getting divorced, so please keep your distance.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As her cold words hung in the air, tension filled the room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven&#x27;s expression darkened, fury radiating from him as he leaned in closer, making it impossible for her to escape. With a gentle yet forceful push, he pressed her back against the bed, pinning her down.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His eyes were icy, breaths quickening as they locked gazes. Diana felt a rush of anxiety, while Steven&#x27;s gaze burned with desire, creating an illusion that the rest of the world had vanished.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This was a side of Steven she had never witnessed before. He was almost unhinged.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Diana, do you want to provoke me? Do you even realize how serious the consequences of angering me can be?&quot; His voice was urgent, tinged with a fury that threatened to consume his reason.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Trapped beneath him, Diana felt her body tense up as she instinctively raised her hands to shield herself. Her large, beautiful eyes widened in panic. &quot;Steven, get off me! Don&#x27;t touch me!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Not touch you? Then tell me, who are you saving yourself for? Is it Alexander, or Cecil, or that college student?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His voice rose, fury evident as he pressed closer, frustrated by how she always created distance between them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana had never seen this feral side of Steven before. It was terrifying.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She pushed against him with all her strength. &quot;Get off me! I&#x27;m saving myself for my future husband, certainly not for you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Those words struck deep, igniting Steven&#x27;s rage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was still his wife, yet here she was, thinking about another man.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="804.html">« Prev</a><a href="806.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
