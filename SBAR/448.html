She remained calm, no longer greeting him warmly like before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This aloof Diana was hard for him to accept. He preferred when he could keep her down in the dirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But thinking about her driving skills, he had to admit she'd changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Elroy had started to respect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd been trying to join Elroy's racing team for ages, but Elroy wouldn't give him the time of day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now he burned with jealousy! He'd been kicked out of that circle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom's company needs funds right now. You're here buying land, did you embezzle company money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana looked at him like he was an idiot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, I haven't even set foot in the Marsh family company since I came back. How could I possibly embezzle anything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is your mind so twisted that you think everyone else is as corrupt as you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you think I embezzled money, call the police or file a report. You can't just throw around baseless accusations."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... I... You can't buy this land. Take that fifty million dollars and help Mom fill the deficit. I'll let you return to the Marsh family, but remember that this is my gift to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric looked down at Diana with an arrogant smirk, his eyes full of condescension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a deep breath, fighting down the stinging ache in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how much time passed, comments like that always managed to wound her deeply, reawakening that yearning for familial love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She let out a mocking laugh. "Eric, did you hit your head or something? Or maybe you've gone deaf? I cut ties with your family ages ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When your family was high and mighty, you looked down on me for being a country bumpkin. Now that your company's in trouble, you have the nerve to ask me for money to cover your debts? How dare you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we're family! You're my little sister. When the family's in trouble, shouldn't you help out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric's voice lost its edge, knowing he was in the wrong. His earlier rudeness had vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You people make me sick. I'm not your little sister! Queenie is. She's a big shot celebrity now with plenty of cash. Why don't you ask her to pay your debts?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's different! Queenie needs her money for her future. You're going nowhere in life, so what do you need money for?" Eric's face darkened as Diana remained unmoved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana nearly exploded with rage. "Eric, you're selfishness incarnate. Just wait - your precious sister will give you the perfect gift. Let's see if you can still talk like this then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana flashed a cryptic smile and walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric froze. The old Diana had been their family's doormat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, she'd come running whenever the brothers called. Even when they'd humiliated her, even when they'd dumped leftover food on her face, she hadn't dared to speak up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When did she grow such a backbone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, if you dare buy this land, I'll tell the whole world how heartless you are, not even caring about your own mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned around, giving him a calm smile. "Go right ahead. While you're at it, tell everyone how Paula raised four good-for-nothing kids who couldn't help when it mattered most and how her husband cheated on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then tell them how you're trying to force your disowned sister to pay off your debts. I wonder what people would think about that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or maybe we should talk about last night when my brother tried to pimp me out to other men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eric, someone recorded what happened last night. When that video gets out and both the Marsh family and the Barnes Group stocks will tank!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even animals wouldn't do something as vicious as what you did. Get out of my sight. You make me sick."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, you... you'll never be welcome back in the Marsh family!" Eric clutched his chest in pain, pointing at her in fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sneered, "Like I care. When I still had feelings for you all, I let you walk all over me. But now that I've cut ties, none of you can hurt me anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Having the same blood as a twisted brother like you makes me feel dirty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eric broke down in tears at her words, looking up at their mother in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula called out quickly to stop Diana.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="447.html">« Prev</a><a href="449.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
