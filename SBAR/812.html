She picked a few, planning a shrimp scampi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she peeled and deveined them, she thought about the rest of the meal: simple and comforting vegetable soups and spicy tacos. Dinner would be ready soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna loved bold flavors, especially spicy chili in winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But over the last two years, Diana adjusted to a lighter diet with Steven. Still, she enjoyed the rich taste of spicy food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her menu set, Diana sprang into action as she prepared the feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could fully immerse herself in the task, she paused and sent a quick message to Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana: [Luna, do you need any extra ingredients for your Chili? If you do, come over and grab some.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna: [Diana, I'm craving spicy tomato soup tonight. Just add some tomato, ham, fried eggs, and a few slices of meat. I'll be in heaven. Don't worry about me. I just love the comfort of spicy food in winter.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled softly, and her heart was warmed by Luna's predictable gusto for strong flavors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, enjoy yourself," she replied in a voice message. "I'll get dinner started."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she set her phone aside and returned to her culinary preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the clock ticked closer to half past five, the winter sky outside darkened swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana flicked on the lights in the villa, bathing the space in a warm, inviting glow that exuded luxury and comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, and her thoughts drifted back to the past, when the mere thought that Steven would come back to eat the meal she had prepared with him filled her with boundless joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might have even abandoned her studies, her dreams of a postgraduate degree, just to ensure she had a delicious dinner waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? The passion and expectation were gone, replaced by a calm acceptance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disappointment, when accumulated enough, left no room for heartbreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana exhaled deeply and wore a soft smile as she settled down to check her phone. The food was nearly ready, and they would sit down to eat soon after Steven arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she scrolled through her messages, a notification from Tobias caught her eye. Tobias: [Diana, I've got news that Julius, Hubery, and Grandpa won't make it back for Christmas this year. How about you come and join us overseas? I can send a private jet for you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced out the window at the heavy snowfall, her heart skipping a beat at the thought of flying in such treacherous weather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But more than that, she didn't want to go this year. Hubery still hadn't forgiven her, and the tension would be unbearable. She sent him messages daily, but they went unanswered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of it saddened her deeply. When she had married Steven, it was Hubery who had been the most vehemently opposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tobias, I won't be able to join you for Christmas this time," she replied in a voice message. "I have someone to keep me company. Luna and Nolan will be with me. Don't worry about me being lonely. I'll come to see you after Christmas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her three brothers were all thriving abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their domestic business flourished as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost as soon as she sent the message, Tobias called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana answered with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tobias," she exclaimed warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," he replied. "I'm a bit tied up with a project this year, but once it's done, I'll have time. You take good care of yourself over there. If you're not happy, our family can always immigrate abroad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised. The idea of immigration was far from her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you even think of something like that?" she asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias chuckled softly. "It's not my idea. It's Grandpa's. He's worried about you and thinks we should all move abroad if it would make you happier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa has such an idea?" Diana's heart ached at the thought. Leopold had always been her pillar of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, when she agreed to the plan, it was Leopold who felt the pang of sadness the most.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="811.html">« Prev</a><a href="813.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
