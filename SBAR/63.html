She had lost her biological daughter forever. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula understood her daughter's personality well. Diana was as stubborn as she was&mdash;once she made a decision, she never backed down. Paula thought bitterly, "Jeff, Queenie, Steven, I will not forgive you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Jeff went to the kitchen to get some tonic, Paula quietly returned to her room, took a shower, put on her nightgown, and lay down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking out the window at the quiet night, Diana's piercing words echoed in her mind like thunder:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, don't worry. I just want to teach her a lesson. She dared to ask you to testify. She's so hateful, never changing her bad habits. Fortunately, I never acknowledged her as my biological daughter."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula couldn't help but cry again. Diana would never forgive her in this lifetime. Diana had been secretly replaced and became the adopted daughter, scorned by the Marsh family. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't even admit that she was Paula's biological daughter. Paula regretted everything she'd done to Diana, realizing she'd been kept in the dark for over twenty years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jeff proposed, Paula believed he loved her sincerely. Now she understood it was all a scam. Because of his supposed kindness, Paula had five children. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eldest and second were twins, and she had always wanted a daughter. Jeff didn't want more children, so she got pregnant on purpose, saying she wanted a daughter. At the time, Jeff seemed reluctant, but she noticed nothing unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff always came home late, but he returned every night. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went on business trips once or twice a month, staying away for just a few days, always with an assistant. How could he suddenly have a lover? Yet his lover's daughter was the same age as Paula's daughter. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and Diana were born on the same day. Paula's daughter had been replaced by Queenie. Jeff had planned this all along. Now, he was eager to live with his mistress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To achieve this, Jeff had been giving Paula a slow-acting poison to induce Alzheimer's, taking everything from her and abandoning their children. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to live happily with his lover and her children. Paula never imagined her marriage was a scam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Jeff approaching, she quickly wiped her tears and applied a facial mask to hide the signs of crying. Sure enough, two minutes later, the door opened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paula, you're putting on a facial mask. I brought you some tonic. You were scared today, though I'm not sure what happened. I just took some myself. You should try it," Jeff said, placing the medicine on the bedside table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula sat up deliberately, touched his hand, and spilled some of the liquid. "Okay, just leave it there. I'll take off the mask and drink it later. It's not convenient now," she said gently, her voice unchanged. Jeff noticed nothing unusual, looked at her, and went to take a shower.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, Paula took out a prepared bottle, poured some tonic into it, and dumped the rest out the window. Afterward, she hid the bottle under the bed, planning to have it analyzed when Jeff let his guard down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the mask, Paula's face was filled with pain. She had never doubted Jeff's love. Over the years, he had never shown his true colors. If he hadn't been so eager to live with his lover, she might never have known until her death. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted revenge. Jeff had caused her to lose her daughter, and she wouldn't let him off easily. Since Diana disliked Queenie and Steven, Paula would help Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Diana's cold, indifferent face, Paula was heartbroken. She shouldn't have said those hurtful words. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried softly, overwhelmed by pain, but felt better afterward. She removed the mask, went downstairs, and washed her face with cold water, staring at her reflection in the mirror.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula was still charming. Why should she spend her life with Jeff, a fat old man? She wanted to ensure Jeff ended up with nothing, unable to take anything from the Barnes family. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sneering, she realized that after learning of Jeff's betrayal, she cried but then felt relieved. Jeff had given her nothing but sweet words over the years. They shared no unforgettable memories or love&mdash;she had been living in self-deception.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Paula resolved to fight back. She had always been strong and wasn't afraid of Jeff. Queenie was incapable; without Paula's money, she couldn't be a pianist. Jeff wanted Paula to develop Alzheimer's, so she decided to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning upstairs, she found Jeff exiting the bathroom, wrapped in a towel. His face was wrinkled, and Paula found him greasy and disgusting. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was ugly. "Honey, let's go to bed," he said, relieved that she had taken the medicine. He believed it wouldn't be long before he could rid himself of Paula.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula looked at his hypocritical smile with disdain. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing his true nature, all she felt was disgust. But she tolerated it for now, intending to divorce him eventually. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I haven't been feeling well and have been up a lot at night. I'm afraid I'll disturb your sleep. Why don't you sleep in the next room?" she suggested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeff was surprised, having just taken a bath and feeling good. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Paula's age, her figure and skin were impressive. "Paula, we're husband and wife. How can we sleep in separate rooms? I miss you and don't want to be apart," he protested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula said nothing, enduring it for the sake of the truth. She planned to find a pill to temporarily disable his sexual function. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made her feel better. She lay down at the edge of the bed, turned off the lights, and turned her back to Jeff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped his arms tightly around her waist, breathing into her ear. Jeff prided himself on being well-groomed, but Paula rejected him. "I'm not in the mood tonight. I can't stop thinking about whether those people were really hired by Queenie to frame Diana," she said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="62.html">« Prev</a><a href="64.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
