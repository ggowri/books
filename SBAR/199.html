So she hooked up with some man to get attention. She's always been shameless like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna sneered, "Penelope, you know exactly who the shameless one is. The bastard in your belly is proof enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna's phone vibrated. She turned and walked away; she was only here to put on a show anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope was stunned. What did this woman mean?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie watched Luna's retreating figure, anger simmering in her eyes. Luna was blocking everyone on purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Foliot, I'm sorry. Diana has always been unruly. If she does anything inappropriate, please forgive her," Queenie pleaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wore a pink gown today, making her look even more innocent and delicate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace looked at her, feeling sympathetic. With a sudden addition of an adopted daughter to the family, Queenie's days couldn't have been easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, you're just too kind. Let's go and see. If it's your adopted sister, I won't let her off," Jace assured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was exactly what Queenie had been waiting for Jace to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd moved forward, eager to watch the spectacle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the door, a waiter tried to push it open, but it wouldn't budge. However, indecent sounds of a man and a woman could be heard inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone's expressions changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie looked even more horrified. "Mr. Foliot..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace's face darkened as he shouted, "Break down the door."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned. Could it really be Diana?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula looked anxious. What could she do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana might have been reckless, but she would never do something so outrageous in a place like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paula decided to bet that it wasn't Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Over the past days, she had carefully observed her daughter's behavior. Diana was composed and mature, unlikely to act this way unless someone set her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sir, the door is locked from the inside and won't open," the waiter said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The waiter looked anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the sounds from inside were unmistakably those of a man and a woman in a compromising situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jace's face turned pale with anger. His 70th birthday celebration had been ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope stepped forward. "Diana, open the door! You can't be so shameless. This is Mr. Foliot's birthday celebration, not a place for your antics."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Penelope, don't jump to conclusions. We're not even sure it's Diana yet. This could ruin her reputation," Queenie pretended to speak up for Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's definitely her. Everyone's here except Diana," Penelope insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It had to be Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana knew the truth about what happened six months ago. Penelope wanted to make sure Diana could never return to the Marsh family so that she could enjoy wealth and status there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only by making the Marsh family hate Diana could Penelope ensure her own misdeeds would never be revealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie remained silent, standing by Jace's side with a look of anxiety, disappointment, and unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fragile beauty evoked pity from those around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The men around couldn't help but steal a few more glances at Queenie's innocent appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie glanced at Steven, whose gaze was terrifyingly dark. His handsome face was filled with intense anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A hint of a smile flashed in Queenie's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the butler rushed over with a key.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quickly unlocked the door, and everyone crowded at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked inside and saw two people on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sounds were indecent, and the figures were obscured behind a curtain. It was impossible to tell who they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Penelope shouted, "Diana, you're so shameless!"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="198.html">« Prev</a><a href="200.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
