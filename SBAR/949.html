"Felicity's in trouble. Do you remember what happened six months ago? We were plotting against Cecil in </span><span>Woodston</span><span>, and now the police have found out about Felicity buying illegal goods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How did they catch her at such a critical moment?" George's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a bad feeling. It seemed like something Diana had orchestrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow was Christmas, yet Felicity's situation had to blow up today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie frowned, "The Foliot family's issue was just resolved, and now this? It's like everything's falling apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of frustration and betrayal bubbled up inside her. "Felicity must've gone behind my back and bought more than she should have. That's why she got caught."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Felicity had ambition, but this reckless greed was a different matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's gaze grew colder. Since his return, so much had gone wrong. His father's company was facing issues, and he could feel a hand closing in from behind, tightening its grip on them. "Queenie, you need to ask her assistant. She's the one who knows the most about her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie nodded immediately. "Alright, I'll call Mario."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out her phone and dialed the number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh," Mario picked up the phone quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mario, find out why Felicity was arrested. All the evidence was destroyed, so how did the police find new leads?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario had already received the news. "Ms. Marsh, I contacted Felicity's assistant. It turns out she bought an extra kilogram. Her ambition was too great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Queenie was stunned. "She bought an extra kilo? Has she lost her mind? For that tiny gain, she's ruined everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's anger surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Marsh, there's no saving her now. It's a life sentence. Her greed was her downfall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's voice turned cold. "I understand. Keep an eye on things. Don't let Felicity spill any of our secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mario reassured her. "Don't worry, Ms. Marsh. I'll handle it. You and the Mr. George Gellar enjoy Christmas. I'll take care of everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sighed in relief. She trusted Mario to get things done. She ended the call and leaned into George's embrace. "George, why does it feel like we're losing everything, little by little?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling gnawed at her, a sinking sense that everything she had was slipping away, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's expression softened as he held her tighter. He brushed a lock of hair from her face and spoke in a soothing tone. "Queenie, you're overthinking. Felicity's mess is her fault. It's got nothing to do with you. Our overseas business is doing well, and these little bumps won't affect us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie closed her eyes and wrapped her arms around him. "George, I'm just glad you're here. You have no idea how long I've waited for this day. Now that you're back, as long as you're by my side, I feel like I can face anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's heart swelled with affection. They held each other in the darkness, sharing warmth and comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Queenie. From now on, every day, I'll be with you," he whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled, her face softening. She nuzzled closer into his chest, her voice light and playful. "George, Christmas is tomorrow. I've been waiting for today for so long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She longed for a future with him, one where they could be happy together, and George would never betray her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, that woman still hadn't appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George lowered his gaze to her and pressed a soft kiss to her forehead before gently lifting her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wrapped her arms around his neck, smiling as she planted a kiss on his lips. "George, let's make the most of these next few days. No one is going to interrupt us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was beyond excited. Finally, she was ready to have sex with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, let's go to the room," she said, her cheeks flushed. She couldn't worry about Felicity anymore. Mario was already handling it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's eyes lingered on her with a look of desire. He couldn't resist her allure. "Queenie, there's an evening banquet hosted by Mr. Turner. We should stop by the party after we're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled mischievously and kissed him again. "Alright, George, I've missed you so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd turned him down before, using excuses, but today, she was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George was masterful in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They headed to the room, and soon, soft, intimate sounds filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George liked to take his time, and ten minutes later, Queenie's breaths grew ragged, a mix of pain and pleasure in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lavish banquet hosted by Joshua Turner was taking place at the </span><span>Capitole</span><span> Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna gently pushed Diana's wheelchair into the grand </span><span>venue</span><span>, where the atmosphere was already buzzing with guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had taken over Steven's company, and many people had come specifically because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up until this point, most people knew Diana as the adopted daughter of the Marsh family, with no direct ties to the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the sudden turn of events where the Gellar Group was essentially hers, everyone was shocked and confused. No one had expected this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance, Joshua and Dalton were standing together, waiting for Diana to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they spotted Luna pushing her wheelchair, they quickly moved forward to greet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bishop, you're here!" Joshua said, his voice smooth, offering a faint yet welcoming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton also greeted her with a friendly nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana returned the greeting with </span><span>a</span><span> polite smile. "Mr. Turner and Dent, good evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua couldn't help but look at her as she sat in her wheelchair, wearing a sleek black evening gown. Despite being seated, her presence was commanding, and she radiated elegance. He felt a surge of admiration. Diana was truly captivating. "Ms. Bishop, please, do come inside. Tonight, the spotlight is on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had never experienced such attention, and she smiled awkwardly, her cheeks flushing slightly. "Mr. Turner, this is your event. I'm not used to these kinds of gatherings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua glanced at her, his silver-framed glasses giving him an air of sophistication. His eyes, sharp and dark, conveyed a depth of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a slight curve of his lips, he said, "Well, then, let me handle the networking tonight. I'll take you inside and introduce you to some of my business partners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled gratefully, following them into the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had earned everything through hard work, and now, she walked into the crowd </span><span>with confidence, greeting people with a warm smile and a quiet strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered the banquet hall, the guests began to greet her warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good evening, Ms. Bishop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good evening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved smoothly through the crowd, greeting everyone along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they reached the center of the hall, Joshua took the stage and announced Diana's new role as the president of the Gellar Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room turned their attention to her, their eyes filled with admiration, awe, and a tinge of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, out of nowhere, a mocking voice rang out from the crowd, questioning her position. "I'm curious, Ms. Bishop. How exactly did you manage to take over the Gellar Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's gaze sharpened as she traced the voice to Yvette in a fiery red gown. Standing beside her were Owen and Yanson, both looking as if they had been waiting for this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face was flushed with anger. "Diana, I never thought your ambition would be so ruthless. All these years, you've been hiding behind Steven, biding your time just to steal the Gellar Group, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Diana took control of the company, she had ended the collaborations with the Toby and Hastings families, which had left both men fuming with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's lips pulled into a knowing, almost playful smile. She glanced briefly at Queenie and George, who were walking inside, before turning her gaze back to Owen and Yanson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, Steven is right there. If you're so eager to defend him, why don't you ask him yourself why he's perfectly happy to hand over the company to me?" she said, her tone laced with sarcasm.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="948.html">« Prev</a><a href="950.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
