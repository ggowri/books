I've been on a plane for hours, and I'm so old. Your brothers achieved nothing, so I'm exhausted."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula headed for her room. "What did you just say about how Diana bullied you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie told her what happened last night in an aggrieved and exaggerated manner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She went on about Diana dating different men.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale chimed in, "Mom, everything Queenie said was true. </span><span>She</span><span> was</span><span> with</span><span> a man tonight when I went over to teach her a lesson</span><span>. </span><span>Diana was so close to him, and she had never been so gentle to me before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She had a very soft voice when she called another man."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale felt upset along the way. As long as Diana didn't fight with Queenie for Steven, he could leave Diana alone and let her live a good life in the countryside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Diana always competed with Queenie. Even when Queenie came back, she still </span><span>refused to let go of</span><span> the position of Steven's wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why didn't she ever think about whether she </span><span>was worthy of</span><span> it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, you didn't know that. Now Diana is just eloquent."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula sneered. Diana had been so humble before, trying to impress Steven and the family, but all she had gotten in return was always their disregard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was now starting to fight back, but Paula had completely lost her daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula didn't say anything because with Gale's misunderstanding of Diana, he wouldn't believe anything she said, so she would just let him go through it all on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of her sons were capable of anything good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had given them a good education, but they were all useless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked helpless. "I'm tired, and you guys should behave yourselves. Stay out of trouble lately, and the company is getting strapped for cash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the stock is falling, the Barnes family will be over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula went back upstairs to bed after warning the two indifferently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Queenie had calmed Gale down, she rushed to send a message to Jeff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie: [Dad, hurry back. Paula's back.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff: [Is she back already?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie: [Yes! Don't stay with my mother. Come back soon, and don't make her suspicious. She'll have to keep her on the supplement tonight.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeff: [Okay. I'll be right back.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sighed in relief. </span><span>She</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s delighted that</span><span> </span><span>Diana had been taught a lesson tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She went to the kitchen with joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isabelle Restaurant was a foreign restaurant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was decorated in a spectacular a</span><span>nd</span><span> ethnic style.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and Tobias were sitting face to face. Diana looked at the cheesy fresh shrimp pizza in front of her, which was her favorite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow! Tobias, I haven't had it in years. It's so delicious."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana picked up a slice of pizza and took a bite. It tasted sweet and fragrant, and she missed the flavor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias ordered steak, shrimp, and a delicious butternut squash soup.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Diana was eating happily, Tobias' eyes were full of </span><span>love</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, I haven't eaten here either since I brought you here three years ago. It still tastes as good as ever."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! Tobias, I'll come here with you more often from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana smiled brightly, more mesmerizing than the </span><span>rosy dusk</span><span> outside the window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was about to speak when she was suddenly surrounded by a man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The familiar scent made Diana know who it was without looking at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Steven!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="92.html">« Prev</a><a href="94.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
