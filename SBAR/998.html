It seemed that way. Now, her feelings for Steven were just like when she had fallen for George.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven was gone, and now all she could think about was the way he had treated her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the past, she had used Steven as a substitute for George. Now, was she using George as a substitute for Steven?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie laughed in frustration. She thought, &quot;How could life be so cruel?</p><p style="text-align:left;">What do I have to do to make my life more happy?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She shook her head, smiling as she explained, &quot;George, don&#x27;t overthink it. I&#x27;m just tired. You wore me out last night, and now my whole body aches.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She nestled against George, her face flushed with shy affection.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George, considering it, realized she was right. He had enjoyed himself thoroughly last night, too. He reached out, pulling her into bed. &quot;Then let&#x27;s rest a bit longer. I&#x27;ll have breakfast sent up soon. You can take your time to recover.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie shook her head. &quot;No need to sleep. There&#x27;s still something I need to take care of. Levi went to see Jace last night. Knowing Jace like I do, he&#x27;s been stuck in the hospital for too long, and now he&#x27;ll go looking for women. This is our chance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I won&#x27;t let that old man hurt me. Sandra is watching over him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She picked up her phone from the nightstand, sending Sandra a message to keep an eye on Jace&#x27;s every move.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sandra replied quickly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sandra: [Ms. Marsh, you were right. After Jace came out last night, he couldn&#x27;t resist. The woman we arranged for him was humiliated, and I&#x27;ve already reported him. The police are on their way up.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smiled as she read Sandra&#x27;s message. It was like she was a demon hiding in the shadows. Whenever she made her move, she could shatter the last bit of peace for those who had crossed her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had long discarded all morality and principles.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This was the price she had paid to achieve her current success.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She simply wanted to succeed, and if anyone had to be blamed, it was those foolish enough to be deceived.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What could kindness change? She had been kind before. Although she had earned the love and favor of others, that wasn&#x27;t the life she wanted.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What she wanted was always to take things into her own hands. What others gave her, she didn&#x27;t care for.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;George, Jace is at the hotel. He&#x27;ll be caught soon. Once he&#x27;s taken care of, we won&#x27;t have many worries left.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Levi is just an actor with no connections. The so-called connections he used to have were all thanks to his father. Now, their company is struggling to survive, and they won&#x27;t have time to worry about this useless man. It&#x27;s the perfect opportunity.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">George smiled, clearly impressed. Queenie might not have many talents, but when it came to manipulating people, she was the best.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Queenie, I knew you were the smartest. You can always control every situation. I admire that about you. As for Levi&#x27;s project, I can also snatch a few of those.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought to himself, &quot;What good is controlling the situation? Eventually, everything will belong to me anyway.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie looked at his smiling face, then quickly said, &quot;George, get up, let&#x27;s go. There&#x27;s a good show waiting. I&#x27;m going to make sure their plans fall apart.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her hand, resting on the blanket, had turned white from gripping it too tightly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her eyes blazed with fury.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wanted to watch their so-called flawless plan collapse under her meticulous calculations, turning into nothing but smoke.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wanted Levi to experience despair in the worst possible way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She wanted Levi to be tightly bound by fear and pain until despair consumed him entirely, turning him into a useless wreck.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was the least she could do to avenge her child, who had died before being born.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The truth was Queenie did love children. She had once dreamed of having a child with George, imagining a complete and happy family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie smiled faintly, remembering how she had once longed for that dream.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now, that once-cherished dream had shattered, and the softness she had once felt had turned into mutual manipulation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie had come to realize that dreams were just dreams. In reality, they crumbled, leaving behind nothing but scars and endless sorrow.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A mix of emotions stirred inside Queenie. Unable to walk, she dressed and sat in her wheelchair to wash up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">George could feel that Queenie had changed. Not just a little, but a lot. The current Queenie was much stronger. This version of her made him uneasy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia had promised to have breakfast with Diana, and she kept her word, coming over early to accompany her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After breakfast, Luna received an update from the person who was keeping an eye on Jace. She watched the video of Jace being taken away by the police and felt a surge of emotion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She finally understood what Diana had meant. Jace would never be able to fight back because Queenie knew how to deal with someone like him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Luna was stunned. &quot;Diana, you were right. Jace really couldn&#x27;t handle it. He didn&#x27;t even get a chance to retaliate before the police took him away.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana felt a sense of helplessness. It was such a great opportunity, but Jace had wasted it and sabotaged himself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jace had always loved playing with women. After being stuck in the hospital for so long, it was inevitable that he would go after women once he was free. In his desperation and loneliness, only this kind of thing could fill the emptiness inside him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And in doing so, he had walked right into the trap Queenie had set for him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie knew Jace&#x27;s personality all too well. That was why he had once been so attracted to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana opened her phone, and Jace&#x27;s name immediately popped up on the trending page.</p><p style="text-align:left;">[Jace, just out of the hospital, dared to target an underage girl.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">There were more than ten similar news.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Netizen A: [That old bastard, he&#x27;s practically on his deathbed, yet he&#x27;s still so heartless, shamelessly disregarding both moral and legal boundaries.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Netizen B: [This scum is beyond redemption. His sons ended up in prison for illegal activities, and now it looks like he&#x27;ll be joining them soon. At least it&#x27;ll finally give the victims some justice.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">Netizen C: [This old man must have no conscience. I feel so sorry for that innocent girl.]</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Diana saw the news, she knew Jace&#x27;s life was over.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She lazily leaned back on the couch, smiling, &quot;In the end, Jace couldn&#x27;t escape Queenie&#x27;s plan.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Olivia&#x27;s eyes flickered, and she patted Diana&#x27;s arm. &quot;Enough, don&#x27;t overthink it. Respect his fate. Everyone has their life path.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ve seen Jace&#x27;s villa. Across from it is a narrow, gloomy alley, filled with negative energy and stagnant air, creating a suffocating atmosphere. All these factors have contributed to the decline of the Foliot family.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana gazed at Olivia with admiration and blinked. &quot;Olivia, that&#x27;s amazing! I admire you. With you by my side helping me, I feel like I could become the richest woman in the world. So, would you be willing to stay with me and help me?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="997.html">« Prev</a><a href="999.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
