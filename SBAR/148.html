Taking it to bed? You could have divorced me and been with Queenie openly, but you chose to keep me stuck in between, just for the thrill. Steven, from the beginning, you were using me. You haven't divorced me yet because I still have some use, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If it's about your grandma, I can handle that. The business rights are already yours. I really don't see how I'm useful anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From the start, she knew Steven married her just to get the business rights from Edward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked into her eyes full of hatred and thought of those videos, his expression growing more intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The photos were real, but the man in them wasn't him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie had deliberately sent the photos to Diana to provoke her, aiming to drive a wedge between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana thought, "Is there ever any love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was right. Queenie wanted the entire Gellar family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced at Queenie, who was crying in pain, and then seriously explained to Diana, "Diana, I've never explained myself to you before, but what you saw may not be the truth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana laughed bitterly. "When Queenie and the Marsh family framed me, what you saw wasn't the truth either. But did you ever stand by me? Like just now, when I was falsely accused of seducing Harry, you didn't say a word. A man like you doesn't deserve me, so hurry up and divorce me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was so furious she wanted to hit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reason Steven didn't step up was because of Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't expose Queenie, afraid of ruining her reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze was heavy. "I thought you would beg me earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she had begged, he would have helped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ha..." Diana laughed in frustration, her heart aching. What kind of jerk had she married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I will never beg you because even a stranger would treat me better. If I fell on the street, a stranger would at least help me up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But as my husband, you let me be humiliated and expect me to beg for your help. Why would I want a man like you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm capable enough on my own. Why would I marry someone useless?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You didn't help me because you wanted to protect Queenie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's eyes were red with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You could say he didn't understand love, yet he spoiled Queenie like a princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was incredibly stingy with his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had been pushing for a divorce, but now he wouldn't go through with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, if you don't divorce me, I'll file for divorce myself. I've got evidence of your affair with Queenie, and I'll walk away with nothing. A divorce is easy; it only takes ten minutes. Please, I don't want to be mixed up with you two anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her previously good mood was completely ruined by seeing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie, no longer in pain, leaned on Steven's arm, crying. "Steven, let's get divorced, please? You always wanted to marry me. You can't let me down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven stepped back quickly, his handsome face showing open disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie, I've told you before. You bullied my wife and schemed against her. I won't marry you. The only reason I haven't touched your family is to save your dignity. Now, get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie froze, on the verge of collapse, crying as she explained, "It's not true, Steven. She's always scheming against me, and you were there each time. Why won't you believe me anymore?" Queenie cried like a helpless victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't understand how Diana, who never fought back before, had become so strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's blue eyes were sharp and piercing, as if he could see straight through her. He looked at Queenie with a smile and said, "You thought I was a fool because I let you. Now, I'm done with that. Do you still think I'm your fool?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana let out an angry laugh. "Steven, so it's true. You knew all along it was that woman, yet you still teamed up with her family to humiliate me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"From now on, unless it's about the divorce, don't show up in front of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luna, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's deep gaze followed Diana's retreating figure. "Diana, tonight we need to talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana spun around excitedly. "About the divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's eyes darkened instantly. The mere mention of divorce made her so eager. Did she really want it that badly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had given her divorce papers many times before, but she had never wanted to sign. He thought this time would be the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," he nodded lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana agreed happily. "Great! I'll be done with work at five."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven smiled, a hint of something in his eyes. "I'll pick you up at five. We'll talk at home."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="147.html">« Prev</a><a href="149.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
