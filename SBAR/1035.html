Diana." Cecil's voice came through, still thick with sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled, "Sleepyhead, you're still in bed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil sounded more awake, a playful tone in his voice. "Yep, </span><span>you</span><span> lazybones, still in bed. It's snowing, and I don't want to get up. I'm still feeling the effects of last night's meds. I'm planning to sleep in today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was left speechless for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going out today. I'm working from home. Don't come over for a while," she said, her voice serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worried that the dangers around her could threaten his life. After all, he was Rita's most cherished grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end, there was a sound of Cecil jumping out of bed, his tone now unhappy. "Diana, you don't like me anymore? You don't want me to visit you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused, realizing how sensitive he was. "No, it's not that. I've just got a lot of danger around me right now. </span><span>Queenie's</span><span> got three assassins on her tail. I need to draw them out, and if you come, you'll get in my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil sounded frustrated. "How would I get in your way? If I come, I'll help take down the bad guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled softly and stirred her pasta. She was hungry, and the smell made her take a quick bite. "Cecil, that's not what I meant. You've got more important things to do. I need you to look into Lillian. I'm pretty sure they're not done with your family yet. Everything Lillian did last night shows they're trying to destroy the Farley name once and for all. The people behind her are still after you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie failed, and now there's another Lillian." Cecil growled, "Damn it, Diana, I had a feeling last night&mdash;there's already a devil-like Queenie around me. Now another Lillian? Seriously?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was full of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep, you're right," Diana replied. "You were hit with Celestia Draught last night. It's a poison made from natural spices, something only the locals know about. Most people wouldn't have a clue how to use it. If you go after her, you'll attract bigger targets. You handle it openly, and I'll work behind the scenes. Keep your cool while I dig deeper. We'll uncover their identities, and who knows, we might stumble on something useful." Her calm, straightforward tone reassured Cecil a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Diana, I'll look into it. Stay safe, and call me if you need anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm-hmm. Queenie won't just sit around. She's still making money, and she'll do whatever it takes to keep that going. Every step we take is a gamble," Diana warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Diana. I've got your back," Cecil said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, Diana smiled, "Alright, alright. You can rest. I'm going to have breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good morning!" Cecil replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, then realized he had already hung up. She laughed softly, set her phone down, and went back to eating her breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana worked from home all day, not wrapping up until 6 p.m. Despite the time, she still hadn't heard anything about Lillian. Queenie was patient, but Diana was even more so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Queenie didn't plan on bailing Lillian out, nor did she want her identity exposed. But what Queenie didn't know was that Diana had learned from a medical mentor, and the mentor wasn't just anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna," Diana called out from her study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna, working outside, quickly closed her files and came in. "Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stretched and then said, "I think the snow has stopped. Go bring the car around. We're going out for stew tonight&mdash;Red Butterfly Restaurant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna raised an eyebrow. "Diana, isn't that Queenie's favorite place? She's been going there every day this winter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was determined to step out and give Queenie a chance to make her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "Hurry up and change. We're going to Red Butterfly. Maybe we'll get things sorted, and at least be well-fed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna wasn't sure what Diana had in mind, but she went to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana got ready too&mdash;grabbing her phone, then heading back to her room for a hat and gloves. She made her way downstairs in her wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was quick. By the time Diana got downstairs, she had already parked the car out front. She helped Diana into the vehicle, and Nick was driving while Barry joined them for the ride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana liked having more people around when it was time for stew, so she invited everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Nick, who was driving, and said, "Alright, Nick, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick smiled and started driving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was warm and cozy with the heater on. Diana smiled and asked, "So, for tonight's stew, what kind are you all in the mood for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna, as always, only wanted seafood stew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grinned happily. "I love shrimp and squid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry laughed, "Luna, can't you try something else? You always want seafood stew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna thought for a moment, then flashed a rare, sweet smile. "Nothing else really sounds good. Shrimp's the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had many options, but the beef stew was her favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't eat much this morning, so when we get there, I'll order two extra servings of stew. Nick, you'll get your own serving&mdash;no stealing from me tonight. I'm starving," she joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick glanced at her in the rearview mirror, amused by her playful tone. "Alright, Diana, I'll order four servings&mdash;one for each of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought that was a good idea. "Perfect. But who's going to grab some little cakes for us afterward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the cold weather, it made sense to have the guys do the running around. After all, if they were around, it was only fair the girls didn't have to do the legwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry answered, "Ms. Marsh, I'll go pick them up. You know I'm a sucker for sweets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm!" Diana smiled, clearly pleased. "I was hoping you'd say that. We're both sweet tooths."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them joked and laughed on the way to the Red Butterfly Restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was dim, with the cold wind biting at the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had made a reservation, so when they arrived, they parked the car, and Barry went off to get the little cakes while the other three headed up to the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was chilly, and both floors were packed with people, though it wasn't noisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aroma of stew filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them sat by a window. Luna shook the snow off her coat and sat with Diana, scanning the room. She didn't spot Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, do you really think Queenie will show up?" Luna asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shrugged and smiled indifferently, "It doesn't really matter. Whether she comes or not, we're still eating dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna looked at her, noticing the calm smile on her face. The moonlight outside created a peaceful, almost poetic scene. It was beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna smiled softly, "Diana, you're getting more and more composed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana leaned back in her chair lazily, her eyes drifting to the snowy scene outside. From the side, her profile was striking, with a delicate nose and an elegant silhouette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna smiled slightly, admiring her. Meanwhile, Nick enjoyed the snow, not imagining anything beyond respect for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana eventually looked away, waiting for Luna to order. Barry returned soon after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They started with a few sweet treats, and their main dishes arrived quickly. The four of them dug in, but Luna suddenly said, "Diana, do you see that man over there?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1034.html">« Prev</a><a href="1036.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
