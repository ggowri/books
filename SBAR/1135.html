"Marie, thank you! Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was grateful to her for giving her son a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come in and let's talk. It's better to clear things up so everyone can move on." Marie instructed the maid to make some coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Gale watched from outside, Althea observed from upstairs. She knew her daughter still had feelings for Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he was younger, Gale was truly a great guy. But over time, he changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gathered in the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one said a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana broke the silence, "Marie, maybe we should head back for now? We can come back another day to celebrate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She simply couldn't stand it any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew she could never forgive Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marie said, "Diana, they're your mom and older brother. You can stay and hear them out too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head, refusing. Just seeing them unsettled her. "Their family drama has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea could forgive anyone, but Diana? She could never forgive Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale once hired thugs to ruin her life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had a biological brother and mother, but she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want them anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale lowered his head in shame, too cowardly to ask for Diana's forgiveness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric kept his head down, silent. For Queenie, he had once tormented Diana mercilessly, doing every cruel thing imaginable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Paula felt a pain so deep it stole her breath away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea hesitated, her voice trembling, "Diana, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cut her off with a smile. "Althea, as long as you're happy, don't worry about anyone else's opinion, least of all mine. Whatever you decide, we'll always be best friends."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood up and left with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula watched their figures fade away, tears streaming down her face. But she quickly wiped them away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea felt a pang of sadness too. Suddenly, she no longer wanted to forgive Gale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Gale before he turned twenty... he really wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t that bad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Gale was so warm and kind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she fell, he</span><span>'</span><span>d panic and carry her on his back all the way to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it rained and she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t have an umbrella, he</span><span>'</span><span>d take off his jacket to shield her from the rain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Gale truly liked her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige also said, "Althea, you two talk. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s catch up tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eric clung to his last shred of hope. "Paige, Frank is still alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige chuckled, "I know. But it has nothing to do with me. When I loved him, he wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t even spare me a glance. He never respected me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I've met a man who truly loves me. I've realized love isn't supposed to be like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Love is about mutual effort. Every time we meet, he</span><span>'</span><span>s so attentive, always caring for me and my feelings. Even during meals, he considers my preferences. Because he loves me, because he likes me, he</span><span>'</span><span>s willing to compromise for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Frank never respected me. It was always me giving, one-sidedly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I was willing to give him everything, all he gave me in return were harsh, hurtful words."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is not Althea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea and Gale are neighbors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Althea had loved Gale her entire life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paige left with a smile. As soon as she stepped out, she called Julius to invite him to dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julius happily agreed and grabbed a cab to meet Paige.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven drove Diana out for dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire ride, Diana stayed silent, staring blankly at the dazzling city lights outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truthfully, she had no intention of forgiving Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to leave this place alone and travel the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let go of Leopold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, sometimes I just want to leave everything behind, move to a new city. Meet new friends, find a new love."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven's grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly. She clearly didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to forgive him. How could he not feel it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stayed silent, driving quietly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana closed her eyes, frustration bubbling inside her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forty minutes later, Steven pulled up in front of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he parked the car, Diana opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven took her hand and asked, "Are you still feeling unwell?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a bitter laugh. "Unwell? That was my birth mother, my own brother. They used the cruelest words imaginable to tear me down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana spoke honestly, "Steven, truth is, I don</span><span>'</span><span>t want to forgive you either. When Gale sent those thugs after me, you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t believe me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know what you were thinking, but you refused to help me. All you wanted was for me to come back and play housekeeper for you. That</span><span>'</span><span>s how I truly felt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana yelled out the window, "Why is this damn life such a mess?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said apologetically, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m sorry, Diana. I caused you so much pain and those awful memories."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what he was thinking back then, the damage he caused her was already done.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana took a deep breath and looked at Steven. "Let</span><span>'</span><span>s go. Dinner first&mdash;I</span><span>'</span><span>m starving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven felt a pang in his chest as he watched her force a smile. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had known about George earlier, he would never have let her endure so much pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything was his fault. If only he had chosen to live back then, their child would probably be walking by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Althea's son today, he deeply regretted everything he had done before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the child called Gale "Daddy," his emotions were... complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt like a tiny seed sprouting in his heart, growing stronger by the second. The joy was both blissful and tinged with pride.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven unbuckled his seatbelt and stepped out of the car. He walked over to Diana and gently took her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana playfully winked at him. "Steven, I'm not upset anymore. My moods come and go quickly. I apologize for what I said earlier!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her with a hint of sadness. "Diana, I'm not angry. You don't have to apologize."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana grinned, "How about you treat me to a fancy dinner tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven pointed to the restaurant in front of them. "They make amazing crab dishes here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned, looking troubled. "But peeling shrimp is such a hassle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled gently. "I'll peel them for you. Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana suddenly asked, "Steven, have you ever peeled shrimp for Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana instantly regretted it. This self-inflicted torment only served to remind her of the pain she had endured in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head. "Never."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone thought he treated Queenie well, but that wasn't the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana asked again, "Have you ever carried her on your back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven shook his head. "No."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pressed further, "Have you ever kissed her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven chuckled and shook his head. "Never. I can't stand her. The closest we've been is standing side by side. Sometimes she throws herself into my arms. Diana, how could I ever do anything more intimate with her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did Diana feel at ease. She cared about this. Queenie was utterly repulsive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Diana's smile was radiant. "Come on, let's go have dinner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana hooked her arm around Steven's. As she glanced up, she saw Queenie standing across from her, her face dark and stormy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1134.html">« Prev</a><a href="1136.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
