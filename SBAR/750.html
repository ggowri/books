With these designs, he could make a lot of money for the next quarter. "Okay! I'll take care of everything later. Just focus on drawing the designs. As long as you keep a low profile, Queenie won't have a chance to plot against you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After discussing with Diana, Alexander returned to the office to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana did not waste Alexander's time. She stood up and left with him. The design drawing issue was resolved, and she could go back and relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a lot of complicated things to do in the family, and it would take him at least three years to grow into a big shot that everyone respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana could afford to wait three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they left, Diana walked in front and Alexander walked behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her thin back and said with a frown, "Diana, you should eat more. You are too thin."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wearing a down jacket, Diana still looked thin though.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had the figure of a model and was happy with it. She turned around to look at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned around suddenly, but Alexander did not stop, so she bumped into his arms and pressed her face against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Diana was embarrassed and wanted to leave, but her soft hair got tangled in a button of Alexander's coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless. "This is what they call the more anxious, the more chaotic," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss..." It hurt Diana a lot the moment she stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, don't move," Alexander said in a low voice. The situation of the two at the moment seemed like a tangle of fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a step forward, approached her, lowered his head and gently unbuttoned her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and his group happened to come out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Steven's perspective, Alexander and Diana were hugging each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven trembled all over, his handsome face became gloomy, and his deep eyes were icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Owen saw that it was Diana, a cruel smile appeared on his lips, and his eyes narrowed slightly. "Diana is really fickle."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Steven was about to walk over, he heard Alexander say, "Okay, does your scalp hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana rubbed her head and said, "I'm sorry, Alexander, it's my fault. I shouldn't have turned around so suddenly."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. It's you who's in pain. From now on, when you see buttons on a man's coat, stay away from him. If you accidentally get your hair tangled in them, it will hurt." Alexander spoke clearly in a low and pleasant voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven and Owen were at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see, Alexander. I just wanted you to know I'm in the right shape."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You eat too little. A batch of high-quality beef will arrive from abroad in a few days. I'll send some of it to you then." Alexander's voice was gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, when summer comes, I'll go fishing for you in the deep sea. I've loved diving since I was a kid, and I have a strong interest in the mysteries of the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was shocked when he saw her diving video. "Diana, let's go together in the summer. I can swim, but I can't dive."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. You'll have to make time in the summer. We can stay there for four or five days. That would be fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them talked as they walked, and did not notice Steven and his group behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at their backs, his eyes sharp, like a lone wolf lurking in the forest, giving off a strong masculine and evil aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Owen could sense that Steven was livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Steven thoughtfully. They had known each other for many years, but this was the first time he'd seen Steven so silent yet full of anger.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="749.html">« Prev</a><a href="751.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
