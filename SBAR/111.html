I can't tell him now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She said, "You said she was mentally ill, and you sent her to the mental hospital yourself. Why do you say I poisoned her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed that she didn't go last night and Queenie framed her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven couldn't even protect his own mother. Who else could he protect? He was so useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at Diana and sneered, "But I have evidence that you poisoned my mother. My mother is indeed crazy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's heart ached suddenly, and she also sneered, "Steven, you never believed me. You think I did it, so it was."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana already knew that he wouldn't believe her. She didn't even say a word of defense now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought, "Steven, you will never know how far your mother went to protect you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You don't understand the reason why she would rather sever the mother-son relationship with you than allow Queenie to come here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana sneered, "Steven, you are a fucking idiot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven said nothing. She was now swearing all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana picked up the bag on the table and said in a cold and arrogant tone, "Let's go and get a divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven clenched his fists and glared at her. "Diana, why don't you explain? Didn't you produce strong evidence to prove yourself several times before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled, "Steven, if you think I did it, take the evidence to the police station to report me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't want to waste my time on a fool like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven said, "Diana, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you going to the divorce or not?" Diana didn't have the patience to argue with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven looked at her and her beautiful eyes. She was tired and didn't even bother to say a word of defense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said, "Diana, have you forgotten what I said? I will not get a divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana couldn't believe it. "Why did you come here if you didn't want a divorce? And you showed up in my room so early in the morning. Aren't you afraid that I would run away and not divorce you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, do you want to let people call Queenie a mistress?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You love her so much. How can you bear to let others call her that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You've already agreed with her that you would divorce me. Why do you always go back on your word at the last minute?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Queenie invited you to the Marsh Villa last night to celebrate my divorce from you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was helpless. Everything she did was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven said calmly, "I never said anything like that to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana turned on her phone and played yesterday's recording.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Queenie said, "Diana, come back tonight and get a divorce. Steven said he wanted to divorce you tonight. You weren't here. Don't accuse me of bullying you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana smiled, "Listen carefully to what your crazy woman says."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven frowned and asked, "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana was helpless. "She looked like a lunatic, acting out of logic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You and Queenie are a perfect match and two psychopaths."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana took her bag and went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But it was so strange. Every day when Diana opened her phone, she would see Queenie's messages. Queenie didn't send Diana any messages last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Last night was such beautiful. Queenie should have sent Diana a message, showing off that she and Steven were getting married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the door, Diana met Tobias who came back from his morning run.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias was sweating profusely and smiled dotingly, "Good morning. Are you hungry? I will prepare your favorite breakfast right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you. I'll go to the restaurant and wait for you and Olivia."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana had a sweet voice and a pure smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven saw her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It turned out that Diana, who was nothing in their eyes, was like treasure in the eyes of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What Steven didn't know was that Diana's business acumen and vigorous and decisive work style.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Women became great once they became rational.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias touched her head. "If you are hungry, come over quickly. I will come over to have breakfast with you in a while. Olivia may want to sleep in. You should learn from Olivia and love yourself more. Don't get up so early. Sleep until you wake up naturally. Do whatever you want at noon. I am here for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tobias was about to leave when he remembered something.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="110.html">« Prev</a><a href="112.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
