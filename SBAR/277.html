Did I say something wrong? Since Diana has left the Marsh family, she should have left for good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Being my sister doesn't matter much. Queenie is my beloved sister, so Diana needs to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besies, I have already told Mr. Watson about her attempt to seduce him and take over as the design director at Aria Group. I'll reveal all her action to Mr. Watson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's tears flowed freely. "Frank, you're so cruel. She's your sister, yet you're pushing her to the brink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, how could I have raised such a heartless son like you? Did Diana do anything wrong? Queenie planned the kidnapping and framed her. Queenie is responsible for everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank retorted, "Queenie did that out of insecurity. If Diana hadn't returned, our family wouldn't be in chaos." Frank also felt sad, but he wished Diana had never come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his mind, Diana's return had thrown his family into disarray, leading Paula to freeze his account and revoke his shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was enraged. Tears welled up in her eyes. She blinked, the tears trickling into her mouth, bitterness seeping into her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Frank, you're right. Blood ties don't matter much. If that makes you happy,, then never forgive Diana," Paula said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I won't forgive her..." Frank responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula continued, "You don't have to forgive her, and she doesn't need your forgiveness. She's done with this family, and you've never been kind to her all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've taken Queenie's side without question. Did you ever consider that had Diana grown up in this family, she'd have been your beloved sister too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fortunately, she didn't. Else, she might have turned as heartless as you. Frank, blood ties don't matter much. Go, love Queenie and Elsie. I don't want you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank stood there, dumbfounded. How had his mother changed so drastically in just a year?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frank snorted, "Diana, it's your fault our family is in a mess." He arranged to meet Nolan the next day, determined to bring Diana down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes glinted with malice as he went upstairs to check on Jeff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, after Diana and Alexander finished their dinner and left the restaurant, they met Steven waiting outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was taken aback. She hadn't seen Steven for days, but now he seemed to appear every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she needed him, he was absent. When she didn't, he was ever-present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, now Diana just wanted them to live separate lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing Steven, too, Alexander subtly positioned himself in front of Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven approached with graceful steps, gazing at Alexander, and uttered coldly, "Mr. Powell, could you please step aside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's warm gaze turned icy. "And what if I don't?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="276.html">« Prev</a><a href="278.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
