"I'll give you two million dollars. Investigate it and tell Diana the results. Diana only showed her design to me. Over the past two weeks, I've only seen Queenie twice. The last time was from a distance. She didn't have a chance to take my phone. I don't understand how the designs were stolen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna stared at him. He didn't seem to be lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, however, had always believed Steven gave the designs to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But from what I know about you, you've always had a habit of giving Diana's things to Queenie. Those two years, though I wasn't with Diana, I was always protecting her. I saw her cry for you, suffer because of you. I honestly wanted to kill you back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna shot him a cold glare, her voice sharp, laced with barely concealed anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven felt a pang of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few days ago," he explained, "after Diana finished the designs, we were at home. She sent me the sketches on her phone, and I saved them on mine. The only other possibility is that our phones were hacked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I planned to launch the new designs, The Flowers, representing spring, summer, autumn, and winter, after the competition. Diana has already completed the entire series, and I love it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also wanted to know the truth. He wanted to know if Queenie somehow set </span><span>them</span><span> up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt this woman was relentless, more irritating than a swarm of flies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Steven could misjudge people sometimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna frowned, noticing the weariness in his demeanor. "You can investigate this yourself. If your phone was hacked, wouldn't you be able to tell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's tech skills weren't bad either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already checked," he said, shaking his head. "I found nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you suspect Diana's phone was hacked?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven smiled faintly. "I never said that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna thought for a moment. She felt the truth needed to come out for Diana's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll start investigating Queenie tomorrow. I want to see what tricks you're trying to play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna still didn't believe Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was momentarily stunned but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Luna was unwilling to believe him, but the truth was very important to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, whatever she uncovered, Diana would trust her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana spent the night in the lab, tirelessly working on the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By morning, she emerged, exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom was waiting at the door. He frowned when he saw her pale face. "You couldn't wait until today to do this? Skipping a good night's sleep makes you look terrible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled wearily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't sleep. After everything that happened yesterday, her mind wouldn't settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to break free from Steven's orbit, to find her own refuge where she could finally breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But escape felt impossible. She couldn't sleep when she went back. When she was agitated, she couldn't sleep</span><span> as well</span><span>, but she could work seriously, using work to numb herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised the three capsules she held. "Tom, the medicine is ready. I'll deliver it to Paige and the others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom grinned. "Give Ms. Sutton's dose to me. I'll take it to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow. "Why you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom rubbed the back of his neck, looking slightly bashful. "I think she's kind of cute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked, catching the faint glimmer of affection in his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you take it to Paige. Has Luna left yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom shook his head. "No, I just brought her breakfast in the hospital. Your husband's still there, too. Out of the goodness of my heart, I brought him breakfast as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan is awake but still feverish. </span><span>He</span><span> was so fragile. He needed to exercise more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Luna is healthier than him," Tom muttered. "Her vitals are excellent. He, on the other hand, has fatty liver."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smirked at him. "What about my breakfast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had come out ravenous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Missing a meal made her very hungry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom pulled a croissant out of his bag. "Here. Your favorite. I kept it warm in my bag for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wrinkled her nose. "Couldn't you use an insulated container? You just stuffed it in your pocket?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!" Tom teased. "I didn't want it to get cold. If it cools, your stomach won't handle it well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And for the record, this is a brand-new jacket, I promise. How can you be so disgusted about my kindness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom smiled indulgently, tapped her forehead, and took a thermos cup from the windowsill, pouring her a cup of water and handing it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drink this first. Warm yourself up before eating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana accepted the cup with a smile. After taking a sip, she bit into the croissant, savoring its rich flavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tom, you always know what I need. This croissant is perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. I've been around you long enough to know all your habits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana beamed. "It's nice to be spoiled by you, Tom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom grinned. "By the way, I've already started recruiting students for the project you mentioned. Plenty of medical grad students are eager to join. Over the next few weeks, I'll evaluate them and select the best candidates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we're ready, you can oversee things. The medical school is thrilled about the AI-assisted therapy program and plans to fund us generously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought for a moment. "Let's hold off until after Christmas. I want to take a break before the year ends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom nodded. "Fair enough. Speaking of Christmas, since Sam and Sir Bishop won't be around, why don't you join my family this year? It's only a few days away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom invited warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana appreciated the invitation but declined with a smile. "I'm spending it with Luna and Nolan this year. You should focus on your family, Tom. As a doctor, you're always working. You should spend some quality time with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a knowing look. "And when you have a girlfriend someday, make sure you don't neglect her. A man who leaves his woman alone isn't a good man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom chuckled, his smile full of warmth. "Don't worry. When I find the one, she'll be my whole world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually wanted to fall in love, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the girl in front of him only regarded him as a brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," he mused aloud, "my future love will be my safe harbor. No matter how stormy it gets out there, she'll be my peace. I will cherish her forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled back. "Tom, I hope you find her soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She handed him the capsule for Paige. "Go on. Deliver it to her."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="873.html">« Prev</a><a href="875.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
