Now that he knew Diana had already divorced, his gaze towards her had become increasingly bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan smiled, "Mr. Gellar, look at how happy they're chatting. They're such a good match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was undoubtedly a subtle jab at Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched Diana laughing happily. Once upon a time, that smile had been just for him. But over time, influenced by his coldness, her smiles gradually became forced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven coldly shot him a glance. "If Diana and I can't be together, you and Luna may not be together, either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan froze for a moment, thinking, "A threat? This must be a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmph! Luna would never be affected!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was not sure. Luna had been indifferent to Evan at first because she didn't like Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they crossed paths more often, she had begun to see his good qualities, and their conversations had slowly increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan had to admit that Steven's words could make him uneasy. He didn't want to lose Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar, when are you going to make your move? If you don't act soon, your wife will become someone else's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My future wife will probably end up being someone else's as well." Evan was anxious. For a man, getting married and having children was the proper course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a career and a happy family was a perfect life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gazed at Diana but didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander must have said something funny, as Diana's laughter grew even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, is that true? Did Mr. Foliot really spend an entire holiday outside Mrs. Foliot's house, begging for forgiveness? Doesn't he worry about freezing himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This winter was particularly cold, and she hadn't paid much attention to the Foliot family's matters since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she knew was that the internal struggle among them had begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victor had been Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rarely gossiped, but last night, while socializing, he had heard a partner mention it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, however, he was deliberately saying it for Diana to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Christmas had been quite eventful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie and George had been attacked on Christmas Eve, and many things had happened that made him feel that celebrating the holidays in Capitole was quite interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just unfortunate that Diana hadn't seen it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! But when he went again yesterday morning, Mrs. Foliot had already left with her parents. She said they were going on a trip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "It's no use regretting now. No matter how much Mr. Foliot regrets, he can never go back to the way things were."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a deep look, his voice low. "Diana, what about you? Can you and Steven ever go back to how things were?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly taken aback, feeling as though Alexander had brought up Mark just to ask her this question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Alexander, I'm already divorced from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled lightly, but as he looked at her hesitation, he knew she hadn't completely forgotten Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's already with Queenie. Diana, are you still hesitating?" Alexander's tone became a bit more forceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly taken aback. Alexander didn't know that the person beside Queenie wasn't Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I've just ended my previous marriage. Right now, I only want to focus on my career. I'm not looking to get into another relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made herself clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Alexander was a great guy with a promising future, and she admired his looks and his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she saw him, she just didn't feel that spark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caught the implication in her words and gave a warm, gentle smile. "Diana, I'll wait for the day you've completely forgotten Steven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was slightly stunned. She thought, "Does Alexander..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled softly. She wanted to clarify things with him. "Alexander..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let's not talk about this anymore. Let's just enjoy dinner. Didn't you say you had something to tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew what she was about to say and didn't want to hear her rejection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him change the subject, Diana let out a quiet sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Alexander, this salmon is incredibly fresh and delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lowered her head to eat the fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gazed at her. She always seemed to eat so delightfully, no matter what she was having. He didn't say anything and smiled as he continued to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every moment with Diana made him joyful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They happily finished their dinner, and Diana talked a little about work. Whatever Diana said, Alexander believed her, and she was grateful for his trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled as she looked at his gentle face. In front of her, Alexander always had that serene, refined expression. She wondered what he was like in front of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he still this gentle and refined?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he came from the most prestigious family in Capitole, a family that many companies and families relied on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rested her chin in her hands, her expression a bit playful. Her eyes sparkled with amusement as she asked, "Alexander, you trust me this much? Aren't you afraid I'll drag you down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled gently, his eyes filled with tenderness. "Diana, you are beautiful, but your beauty isn't the kind that's shallow or seductive. Your beauty is pure and profound, the kind that penetrates the soul, making people unknowingly fall for you, willing to give all their trust and sincerity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked in surprise, her eyes widening for a moment. She hadn't expected him to speak of her in such a way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange emotion stirred within her. Diana blinked her eyes. His words gently stirred within her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed happily. Who wouldn't love hearing such sweet words?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising her gaze, she met Alexander's adoring gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was a little flustered. "Alexander, now you've made me feel a little shy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her face redden, Alexander smiled even more brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, standing there quietly, was enough to captivate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, not far away, Steven watched this scene, and it felt like a sharp stab to his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he spoke coldly to Diana, he was only pushing her further away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he had believed that his fate shouldn't be entangled in love. He had thought that only by controlling everything could he survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to that time when Diana watched him and Queenie's intimate, boundaryless affection, he now finally understood how she must have felt when she saw him with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Steven was filled with countless regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt his throat tighten, his breath growing shallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the beginning, he had shut Diana out of his world, but Diana wasn't the kind of person to wait around for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the positions had reversed, he realized how painful it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at Diana, her smile so lively and captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Diana, if I go through everything you've been through, will you come back to me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1000.html">« Prev</a><a href="1002.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
