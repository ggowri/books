She was furious, feeling completely helpless. This was the crucial moment for her to rise to fame. With the recent buzz from her award-winning fashion design, everything after this should be smooth sailing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her name was starting to get out there, and she was just waiting for her big break.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had originally planned to enter the piano competition for the exposure, to get a foot in the door of the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, Diana's sudden loss of control threw off her plans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she thought back to everything that had happened, the flames of anger in her chest burned even hotter. She snapped her gaze back to George.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"George, we can use a stunt double for the running and jumping scenes. They'll start shooting in a few days, and I've already contacted Zion. But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie's eyes locked onto George, her expression clouded with doubt. In her dream, Zion was exposed&mdash;his female stars, many of them, had met untimely deaths. Some of them, their bodies were never found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could almost see the scenes play out in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was willing to take a gamble. She needed to know if what she saw in that dream was real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zion's secrets could be the key to it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"George, we could take over Zion's agency. I've already joined his company, and I'm going to look for an opportunity to see how they operate. He's a powerhouse in management, with tons of valuable partnerships. If we get his company, our plans will move forward much faster."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was determined to become the queen of business in Capitole, the one everyone envied. Nothing&mdash;no one&mdash;could stand in her way. She was going to be a thousand times better than Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George blinked in surprise. "Queenie, he's your agent now. How do you plan to take over his company?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her ambition had always far surpassed his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, Zion holds a position in the entertainment industry that few can shake. I've done my research&mdash;he's got powerful backing. Taking his company won't be easy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie scoffed, "George, if we're playing this game, we might as well go all in. Why don't you have the guts I do? George, fortune favors the bold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George took a deep breath, his eyes narrowing as he glared at her. "Queenie, we've been working on this for years, only for it to all come crashing down. Now, with everything on the line, we have to be extremely careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are plenty of elites in Capitole, and even more influential families. Right now, we've already pissed off the Farley and Foliot families. The business advantages are no longer on our side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All future dealings need to be with people who truly have the skills. The elites you've been quietly grooming&mdash;they're going to have to step up and start working for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A brief pause, then George added, "Too bad about Felicity. She had such a sharp mind for business. If only we could get her out..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie shook her head. "It's impossible. We can't get her out. Cecil's got the police department on lockdown. With him watching, and the evidence stacked against her, there's no way to bail her out. I've already told her to focus on staying calm. I'll make sure her brother takes over her position. She agreed, and she won't turn on us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! If it weren't for her own greed, there could have been so much more waiting for her." George's anger flared, his frustration clear. Everything had spiraled out of control, leaving him struggling to adjust to this new, chaotic reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gritted his teeth, the sharp pain in his head almost unbearable, but he quickly forced himself to relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of everything he lost when Steven was taken from him&mdash;now, wearing Steven's face and living his life, yet still unable to get what he wanted&mdash;stung him deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time he thought about it, his heart churned with rage and resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie chuckled softly, "George, it's her own fault. But what I said earlier is true. As long as we get something on Zion, we'll win."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She leaned in close and whispered something in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George's eyes widened in shock. He leaned forward, his voice low with disbelief. "Queenie, are you serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie thought back to everything that had happened in her dream. She gave a slight nod. "It's true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George was visibly excited, his mind racing. He didn't even seem to notice his dizziness as he grabbed his phone and made a quick call, instructing his people to investigate the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie let out a breath of relief. It was a glimmer of hope&mdash;perhaps fate was showing her some mercy after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After losing everything, she had seen what the future held in her dream. If she could seize the opportunity, she could still get everything she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just the thought of Diana ruining her plans made her blood boil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for Diana's interference, the Farley family would already have been hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Cecil... well, he was already out of the picture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her dream, after taking over the Farley family, she had sailed smoothly through the business world, ruthless and unstoppable, with countless enemies vanishing without a trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula's entire life had also been hers to control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the dream, her family of four lived in perfect happiness. Her mother had achieved her wealth dream, and there was no sign of Mark&mdash;no sign that Noah wasn't her father's biological son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sighed softly. A beautiful dream, but ultimately just a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she woke up, the reality was nothing but a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about that useless Noah only made her mood darker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, I'm hungry," George muttered, rubbing his stomach, which was starting to feel unsettled. He knew Queenie wasn't the type to cook, so he wasn't expecting much. He just needed something to settle his stomach&mdash;he hated the gnawing sensation of hunger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie felt the hunger pangs too. "I'll have Mario bring us lunch," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George gave a faint nod, closing his eyes and murmuring, "Mm-hmm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie quickly texted Mario to have lunch delivered. As she sat there, her mind raced. The past day and night had given her a lot to think about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had a clearer vision of what needed to come next. The road ahead had to be approached carefully. No more falling into Diana's traps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Diana went out to visit some friends. She first stopped by to see Cecil and Rita, with Samuel also there. Samuel had changed a lot&mdash;he seemed much calmer now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana only brought Luna along, and the two of them stayed for lunch. Everyone sat together, enjoying the meal. Rita was the happiest to see Diana, though her concern quickly surfaced when she noticed Diana was still in a wheelchair. "Diana, is everything okay with your leg?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and reassured her, "Madam Farley, it's nothing serious, just a broken bone. I just need some time to rest, but I'll be fine. For now, I have to use a wheelchair when I go out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil chuckled, "Diana, Queenie and Steven got beat up on Christmas Eve. They're still in the hospital recovering."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel was there too, but he knew better than to spill any more details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana had already heard about it, but she just smiled and said, "Cecil, let's not talk about Queenie today. It's a happy time, so let's just enjoy the meal. This food tastes amazing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She really wasn't in the mood to hear Queenie's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cecil grinned broadly, "Alright, Diana, we won't bring her up. Let's raise a glass, celebrate new beginnings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel's voice was full of emotion as he looked at Diana with admiration. "Diana, if it weren't for you, I would've spent Christmas rotting in a jail cell. Cecil's right&mdash;I'm a new man now. Diana, I owe you this toast. To my new life."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="969.html">« Prev</a><a href="971.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
