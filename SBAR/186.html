The man cried out in pain, his head spinning as he raised his hand high, still holding the camera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He spun in place before crashing heavily to the ground, landing face-down in a pathetic heap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It all happened so fast, as if they appeared out of nowhere, catching them completely off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They hadn't even sensed anyone approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's gaze was icy. His lips pressed into a thin line, and his whole demeanor radiated hostility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He bent down, snatched the camera from the man's hand, removed the memory card, and handed it to Evan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man, seeing the card taken, grew anxious. Ignoring his pain, he struggled to his feet and tried to grab it, but Steven kicked him back down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You... Mind your own business! Give it back," he shouted at Steven, his tone full of rage and his eyes flashing with malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's brown eyes were clouded with a chilling gloom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're asking for it!" Steven said, handing the camera to the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The police came over and arrested the five men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven turned to Evan and said, "Go with them and find more evidence. I want to make sure they never get out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's handsome face remained stoic, but those who knew him could tell he was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan understood and followed the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana objected. "Luna, you go with them. I don't trust him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven trembled slightly when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He turned around, just as Luna finished adjusting her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven asked in a deep voice, "Diana, you don't trust me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's gaze was cold as she looked at his calm expression. Steven seemed angry, but she couldn't understand why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I don't trust you. Thank you for saving me tonight, but I still don't believe you. The card is with Evan. Even when you had evidence before, you still plotted with Queenie against me. So, I won't trust you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I have no evidence for tonight's events, but I hope you had nothing to do with it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven felt a sharp pain in his heart. He hadn't believed her before, and now she didn't believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, this was what it felt like to be wrongly accused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana's disbelief in Steven was real. No one understood better than she did how much Queenie meant to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna comforted her, "Ms. Bishop, I'll take you to the hospital first, then I'll head to the police station."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay," Diana replied weakly. Unable to walk, she needed to get to the hospital since she didn't have the antidote.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven approached Diana, crouching down to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She lay there, defenseless, but her eyes were filled with wariness toward him. Steven paused, realizing the harm he'd done to this girl, making her so cautious of him. His voice was heavy. "Diana, you... don't trust me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sorry, you've never given me a reason to trust you. And you, someone who never keeps their word. You promised a divorce, I agreed, but you didn't go through with it. You came here, took the memory card, just to make sure we couldn't find the truth, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She never expected Steven to show up here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She and Cecil had been kidnapped together. Afterward, he joined the investigation, giving her an extra ally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's decision to rescue her truly shocked her, but she didn't want to be entangled with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her goal in starting over was to sever ties with him, protect her three brothers' lives, and preserve her grandfather's legacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Steven, my kindness doesn't blossom. The one who raised me, the person I trusted most, told me not to trust anyone. I didn't understand back then, but after being wounded by you all, now I do. I don't even trust myself anymore. How could I trust you?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="185.html">« Prev</a><a href="187.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
