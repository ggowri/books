"Steven, I didn't put my hand in there on purpose. Didn't you hear me calling you? How can you say that about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven looked at her, his gaze devoid of any warmth. His tone was flat. "I didn't hear you. What did you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, I called you several times today, but you didn't pick up. I missed you and wanted to have dinner together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie smiled softly, her eyes tender as she looked at Steven. His profile was strikingly handsome, but right now, he appeared cold and distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a commanding presence, but after witnessing his ruthless side, Queenie had always held a sense of fear towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's smile was icy. "Queenie, I didn't see through your little tricks before, but I do now. Doesn't it make you feel embarrassed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Queenie was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pretty awkward, isn't it?" Steven smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's smile froze. She realized he had done it on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, don't you trust me? I haven't been playing games, nor have I tried to deceive you. I just want you to keep your promise. You said you'd marry me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's smile vanished, replaced by indifference. "Queenie, I've already answered that question once. I won't answer it again. Just leave; I'm not in a good mood today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned. "Steven, are you really going to abandon me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven leaned back gracefully in his seat, gazing out at the snowstorm outside. "Queenie, a man's promise doesn't always count. Didn't you make promises to me too? You said you'd never leave me, but the moment I had that car accident and went blind, you left. We're even."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... Steven, I didn't abandon you." Queenie's voice was urgent, trying to defend herself. The way Steven treated her now, sometimes cold, sometimes warm, was impossible for her to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven, what about my hand? It still hurts. I have a piano recital in a few days, and all my teachers will be there. Steven, please come too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven glanced at her and replied coldly, "Fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie hesitated for a moment, then said, "Steven, my parents have divorced, and I've moved. I'm now staying in the apartment you bought me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That apartment was bought with my money, and it's still under my name. Just make sure Diana doesn't find out. Otherwise, everyone will know you're a mistress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had never been a kind person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't going to miss a chance to get back at Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie's face twisted with shock. "Steven, that apartment is mine. You gave it to me. You're not planning to take it back, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. I just think if Diana finds out, she might cause trouble for you, which wouldn't be good for your reputation. So, either return it or move out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you don't want to move, that's fine. Diana didn't ask for my property when we separated, so it won't affect you much. Just don't pull any more stunts like earlier. You'll only end up hurting yourself and wasting my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was momentarily stunned. She had deliberately gotten her hand caught in the door to test him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized now that Steven no longer cared for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, a hint of grievance in her voice. "Steven, what's gotten into you? Why are you speaking like this? Have you fallen in love with Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was taken aback. He hadn't considered that possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her with another man made him feel angry and uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the past, he had chosen Queenie over Diana time and time again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="589.html">« Prev</a><a href="591.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
