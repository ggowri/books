There were scratches on his face. He was still very young. "Tom, how old is him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom explained, "He is 19 years old this year. He loves motorcycles. Today, he was racing with his enemy and was hit. His legs were broken, and he almost lost his life. Diana, help me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom's voice trembled slightly. He was very anxious and hated himself for not being good at medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My cousin is still so young. If he dies, his mother will despair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Tom was about to cry, Diana patted his shoulder and said, "I can perform the surgery, but I am not on duty in this hospital. He must be transferred to the hospital where I am on duty. I will perform the surgery and then observe his condition after the surgery."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom had a very good relationship with her, so she would help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom was very excited. "Diana, thank you so much. This is a film of his leg. I just want to transfer her to this hospital for treatment. They specialize in orthopedics here. I'm lucky to have met you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana saw the film. After a minute, she said, "It's too serious. We can only do surgery first. I will treat him with all my heart. He is expected to be on his feet within two years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But he can't ride a motorcycle anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom said, "Humph! I won't even let him drive a car in the future. I told him a long time ago that riding a motorcycle is dangerous and he could lose his life if he's not careful. But he just wanted to have fun and ride the motorcycle so fast. Now he should regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana shook her head and chuckled. "Tom, we also ride motorcycles. Do you think people who fall in love with this feeling can give it up easily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We'll talk about that later. I will try my best to save not only his life but also his legs." Tom was very tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana then remembered to ask. "When did you return?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom smiled, "Diana, I have only been back home for three days. I was just about to call you today. What a coincidence that I ran into you in the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom was very happy. He had a tall and strong figure, a straight back, and looked elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His handsome face with a smile was bright. His clear eyes and gentle smile made him seem approachable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled, "I'll help him transfer to Tanaxes Hospital first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's great. Diana, thank you!" Tom went to get a transfer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was about to leave but stopped by Paula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana turned around and looked at Paula with tears. Paula was trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana asked calmly, "What's up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula glanced at the ward opposite. "Diana, you know medicine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said succinctly, "A little bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula glanced at the ward. Gale also heard them. She said, "Diana, Gale is still my child. I know that if I send him abroad, he will not survive. Please save him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how much she hated Gale, he was Paula's son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula said those words in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana refused coldly, "I dare not! If I can cure him, the people who hurt him will not let me go. If I can't, I don't know what you will do to me. You have framed me many times. I remember it clearly. Please find another doctor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was Gale's fate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paula was shocked. Diana remembered everything Paula had done.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="233.html">« Prev</a><a href="235.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
