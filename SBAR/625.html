I don't have to eat with Queenie&mdash;what a relief!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was a well-mannered man. His words were surprisingly harsh, clearly revealing how much he hated Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shot him an angry glare, secretly cursing, "You bastard. Just wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noticed the fierce look on Queenie's face and felt a bit concerned for Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reminded him, "Cecil, she's really taking this personally. Be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil replied, "Diana, she likes to play dirty. I'm really scared of her. After all, we're cultured people; we can't stoop to those kinds of lows."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but chuckle. "Cecil, I hardly think that's true."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew all too well that he could play dirty himself, having experienced it firsthand in their previous lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This version of Cecil was more mature than the one before&mdash;less frivolous, more mature.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had learned from his past mistakes, where his arrogance and over-reliance on wealth had led to his death. In this life, he had grown up quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Cecil's ignorance and arrogance that Queenie found most appealing, as they could be quite useful to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since Cecil didn't take the bait, she settled for Samuel instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on his previous character, Cecil would do those bad things, but he had matured.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And lately, that nightmare had been haunting him relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, it's terrifying. I dream about it every night&mdash;my hands and feet thrown into a sewer, dying a horrible death," Cecil said.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana froze slightly while eating. She knew that he had died tragically.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she only saw it on the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she had been so focused on Steven that she had paid little attention to the world outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Try not to dwell on it," she said. "You'll be fine. But Samuel might be the one in trouble. He'll be out soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had no idea what choice Samuel would make. If he still chose to align himself with Queenie, they could be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil knew Samuel was being released in two days, but he figured it wouldn't matter much. Their company was in crisis, and Samuel would likely be too busy sorting that out.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Diana asked, "Cecil, when will they start construction on that land Queenie bought?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil eagerly replied, "Not yet. With the snow, they haven't started anything. Probably another month, but they've attracted a lot of investment recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fell deep into thought. With half a month gone, the scandal of Paula's company would be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "Soon, Queenie won't just have a stomachache; she'll be in real trouble. Just wait for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was intrigued. "What do you mean, Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait and see. Now finish up your meal," she urged, quickly wrapping up her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil, however, preferred to linger over his food and even ordered more.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted about foreign maternity products, and Cecil agreed that after Christmas, they should travel abroad together to discuss potential collaborations.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt content this winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alexander was not involved in this field, she could only cooperate with Cecil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had a pleasant meal together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie had indeed gone to the hospital. After leaving the restaurant, her discomfort grew, and an unsettling, sticky heat filled her with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, she and Levi even used sex toys for excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven anxiously accompanied her during the examination, glancing at his watch occasionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He supposed Diana and Cecil must have finished their dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a man, he could sense that Cecil had feelings for Diana.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="624.html">« Prev</a><a href="626.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
