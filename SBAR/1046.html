"Diana, you seriously questioning my feelings for Queenie?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a laugh. "Dylan, it's not that I look down on you. But someone like you? Real feelings? Come on. Queenie tried to kill </span><span>Paula</span><span>. Everyone knows </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>protect </span><span>their </span><span>mom, no matter what."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But what did you do? Did you forget?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's face turned pale. He felt utterly embarrassed, like Diana had just slapped him hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anger bubbled inside him. His heart skipped a beat. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Isn't </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Paula</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">still alive?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice trembled. "Diana, stop talking nonsense. Our family ended up like this because of you. Why did you even come back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a cold laugh. "When Queenie ran off, refusing to marry blind and crippled Steven, you all made me take her place. You know better than anyone why Jeff brought me back. If you hadn&rsquo;t look</span><span>ed</span><span> for me, I wouldn&rsquo;t return to this messed-up family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Every one is despicable and downright vicious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Diana really see all of us as despicable?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Indeed, there were things they had done to help Queenie scheme against Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie had grown up with them, and all their love had been given to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Diana suddenly came back and started picking on Queenie at every turn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, they didn&rsquo;t want to waste their time pleasing Diana anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, </span><span>we</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>re</span><span> family, you should sacrifice for us. Besides, </span><span>we</span><span> give you a life of wealth. What more could you possibly want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana scoffed, "You've enjoyed the wealth for over twenty years, so shouldn't you do something for your family too? Yet, when Paula was in trouble, where were you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When she was being humiliated in the snow by Jeff, Queenie, and your grandparents, where were you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pulled out her phone, tapped on a video, and held it up for Dylan to see.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take a look. See how your dear father and sister forced </span><span>c</span><span> to divorce, and how your grandmother insulted her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan lowered his gaze to the video.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In it, Jeff shoved Paula into the snow, while Queenie slapped her across the face, spitting out the most venomous words imaginable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan clenched his fists tightly, glaring at Diana. "Diana, you&rsquo;re really something, aren&rsquo;t you? What&rsquo;s your plan with this video? Who are you trying to threaten?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone knows what really happened. </span><span>Paula</span><span> schemed against </span><span>them</span><span> first. She deserved </span><span>it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana and Luna were momentarily struck with disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna couldn&rsquo;t help but growl, "Damn! If Ms. Barnes knew she had such an ungrateful son, would she lose sleep over it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Ms. Barnes hadn&rsquo;t figured out Queenie&rsquo;s plan, this </span><span>bastard</span><span> </span><span>would&rsquo;ve been dead already. Probably on some foreign street corner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shook her head, her voice carrying a hint of confusion. "No, she deserved it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Dylan was dumb, but she never thought he could be this dumb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was furious, feeling Diana and Luna had gone too far. "Don&rsquo;t ignore me. Dead on the street? What the hell do you mean, you damn woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna let out a cold laugh. "Frank died in the ocean. Deep down, you know exactly why he died</span><span>.</span><span> You just don&rsquo;t want to admit it. Your fate might end up even worse than Gale&rsquo;s or Frank&rsquo;s."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan's heart skipped a beat. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No, no way. Queenie wouldn&rsquo;t do that to me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna knew she couldn&rsquo;t convince him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And by the way, Queenie didn&rsquo;t even save her own brother, Noah. Let him die in the ocean. You&rsquo;re nothing but a useless pawn. She </span><span>keep</span><span>s</span><span>g </span><span>you around because you&rsquo;re still useful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie knows </span><span>Paula</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> assets. </span><span>S</span><span>he&rsquo;s definitely use you to steal her company&rsquo;s trade secrets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then she&rsquo;ll push you to fight for inheritance. If you two get your hands on that, it&rsquo;ll be enough to keep you living comfortably for a lifetime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was telling the truth. But Dylan's expression showed he probably wouldn&rsquo;t believe her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glanced at the time, then turned to Luna, "Throw him out. And don&rsquo;t let him back in again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna looked at the two security guards by the door. "Throw this man out. From now on, no strangers or anyone without an appointment is allowed in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Dylan didn&rsquo;t seem like much of a threat, no enemy should ever be underestimated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I-I&rsquo;m not leaving. Diana, I need you to do something."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As a woman, you should be home</span><span>,</span><span> taking care of your husband and kids. Give the company back to Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop trying to play CEO like a man. Today, I&rsquo;m making the decision. If you give the company back, I&rsquo;ll acknowledge you as my sister."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Dylan like he was an idiot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn&rsquo;t understand how he dared to say something like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gripped the wheelchair handles tightly in anger. She had truly underestimated the shamelessness of the Marsh family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were shameless, one more than the other!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna was stunned</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Does Dylan look down on women?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana held back her anger, forcing a fake smile. "I don&rsquo;t want a brother like you. Why don&rsquo;t you stick to being Queenie&rsquo;s brother instead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you&rsquo;re nothing. How dare you order me to give up the CEO position? It&rsquo;s the 21st century now. And you&rsquo;re still telling me women should stay at home? Fuck off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, you&rsquo;re a girl. Be reserved. Even if you&rsquo;re angry, don&rsquo;t use such foul language," Cecil&rsquo;s lazy voice drawled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan knew Cecil. "Mr. Farley, how did you end up knowing this bumpkin Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt a bit incredulous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it, watch your mouth," Cecil snapped, kicking Dylan in the calf.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan hissed in pain, furious. "Mr. Farley, I call you Mr. Farley out of respect. We can talk, but kicking me? That&rsquo;s hardly gentlemanly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were too many people around, he felt too embarrassed to rub the spot where he&rsquo;d been kicked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil let out a cold laugh. "And bullying a girl makes you a gentleman?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shot Dylan a glare, then turned to Diana with a hint of surprise. "Diana, how is he still alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana explained, "He&rsquo;s still useful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood right in front of them, yet they talked about his fate so casually.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Dylan could react, two security guards grabbed him and started dragging him out forcefully. "Let me go! Let me go! I&rsquo;m not done talking!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more he struggled, the more his hands hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at Diana and shouted, "Diana, if you don&rsquo;t return the company within three days, I&rsquo;ll make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave him a calm glance before heading upstairs with Cecil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil personally pushed her wheelchair into the elevator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching this, Dylan felt uneasy. He couldn&rsquo;t understand when their relationship had gotten so close.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1045.html">« Prev</a><a href="1047.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
