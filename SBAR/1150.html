To me, you are the real priceless treasure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt his smile carried a deeper meaning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But hearing his words, she felt very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, she envied Queenie because Steven spoiled her so much. But she was unfaithful to Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Queenie, who was bidding, suddenly hooked Steven's arm, and then gave Queenie a provocative glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Darling, I really like this diamond. You must bid for it and give it to me, no matter the cost. I love this gem so much. As long as you give it to me, I'll forgive you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven thought, "Is she being sincere, or is she saying this because Queenie is here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Alright! Darling, it's a deal. I'll definitely bid for it and give it to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he wasn't talking about this gem, it was another one, Unfading Love!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven affectionately reached out and patted Diana's head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leaned close to Diana's ear and whispered, "Diana, there's something even better. I'll bid for a better gem for you later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew he was setting a trap for Queenie, so she deliberately played along with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie sneered. She wouldn't let Diana get what she wanted. If Diana liked something, she couldn't have it, she'd destroy it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie said, "Five billion dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario softly reminded her, saying, "Queenie, our liquid funds are only five billion dollars. Don't raise the bid anymore. If it's a trap..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie replied, "Mario, I know Steven too well. As long as Diana likes it, he'd spend even a billion dollars. Since he has money, let him spend a bit more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Six billion dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil helplessly thought, "This necklace is worth at most one billion dollars. They've actually raised the price to seven billion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stubbornly said, "Eight billion dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana guessed that Queenie's liquid funds were almost used up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A lot of Queenie's money was invested in those branches she seized.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven was about to raise his paddle, but Diana suddenly held his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Steven, I don't want it anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven frowned and said, "Diana, didn't you just say you really liked this necklace?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I do like it, but we can't spend so much. We recently provided free special medicine to those patients, and now we need money."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's words caught everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many of the entrepreneurs present were conscientious ones, looking at them with admiration. Steven's good deeds were not something an average company could achieve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie was very anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Steven was very wealthy and didn't lack these few billion dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie provoked Steven, saying, "Mr. Gellar, you previously bought a billion-dollar island for me. Now, you wouldn't hesitate to buy a necklace for Diana, would you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven glanced at Queenie and said, "That island was never bought for you; it was for Diana. The owner of the island has always been Diana. It has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't even have the right to go to that island, and I recently took Diana there for a vacation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt like she had fallen into a trap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe she really didn&rsquo;t understand Steven at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Steven Queenie knew would never give up on bidding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn&rsquo;t want to spend eight hundred million dollars on a diamond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This eight hundred million dollars was all her liquid assets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven suddenly gave up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie started criticizing Diana again. "Diana, you&rsquo;re really stingy. Mr. Gellar is willing to spend money on you, but you refuse. You don&rsquo;t deserve to own an expensive diamond."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don&rsquo;t deserve to wear such a beautiful diamond necklace either. Diamonds always complement people of noble status, and you&rsquo;ll always be a bumpkin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "You..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana quickly stopped the furious Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "She can insult me all she wants, I don&rsquo;t care. But losing eight billion dollars will hurt her. I still win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn't bear to see her insulted by Queenie. Anything Diana liked, he would give to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "Ms. Marsh, since you like Stellar Love, I won't compete with you for it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Mario again and said, "I heard you're with Mario now. Didn't he come here for you today? Mr. Gillespie loves you and wouldn't want to give the diamond necklace to me, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gave them a cheeky smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last time when they were shopping for clothes, Queenie didn't fall for it. This time, she thought she knew Steven well, which is why she got tricked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's words could no longer hurt Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie and Mario were so angry their chests hurt, but they could do nothing about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Queenie mockingly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more adored Queenie was before, the more embarrassed she felt at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the host struck the gavel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eight hundred million dollars, going once."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one raised a paddle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eight hundred million dollars, going twice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, no one raised a paddle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at her with a provocative smile, very beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Queenie was distracted, the host said, "Eight hundred million dollars, sold! Congratulations to this lady for winning Stellar Love at the price of eight hundred million dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spring breeze blew in, lifting the curtains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hair by Queenie's ear was blown up. Her face was pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana held Steven's arm, not daring to laugh out loud, afraid of disturbing others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven looked at her and gently patted her back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecil and Olivia on the side were speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they were also glad that Diana could scheme against Queenie like this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie knew Steven did it on purpose. He knew how much liquid assets she had.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was too late for her to regret. Steven stopped bidding. She had to pay the eight hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie stood up angrily, looked at Steven, and said, "Steven, how dare you set me up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven calmly said, "Ms. Marsh, we were bidding normally, everyone saw it. What makes you say I set you up?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1149.html">« Prev</a><a href="1151.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
