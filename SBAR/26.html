Queenie wasn&#x27;t the one who saved me at all. I was set up that day, and something was put into the swimming pool.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And my bodyguard suddenly got into a car accident. You knew that the doctor&#x27;s examination found traces of other toxins in my wounds, but you didn&#x27;t investigate. Instead, you regarded her as my savior.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You don&#x27;t deserve to be my grandson.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As Rita&#x27;s angry voice faded, everyone turned their gaze towards Queenie in surprise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie was shocked, wondering why Rita had suddenly awakened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had planned to resolve everything here and ensure that Rita never woke up because the incident that day was her plan against Rita.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was the first time Cecil had been scolded, especially in front of so many people. He suddenly felt humiliated and shouted angrily, &quot;Grandma, I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re talking about...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Then look at the screen behind you,&quot; Rita said, signaling her bodyguard with a glance. The bodyguard pressed the remote control, and a video began playing. In the video, Queenie quickly emerged from the swimming pool, checked that no one was around, pretended to save Rita, and cried for help.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The corner of Cecil&#x27;s mouth twitched. Only then did he realize how foolish he had been.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie&#x27;s face darkened. She had destroyed those videos, so where did these come from?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Queenie looked at Rita and explained, &quot;Madam Farley, when I saw you lying motionless, I was so frightened that I fell into the swimming pool. But as soon as I climbed out, I called for help. Mr. Farley came over after hearing my cries.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rita sneered, &quot;Then please explain why my bodyguard suddenly got into a car accident.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What does your bodyguard&#x27;s accident have to do with me?&quot; Queenie asked, though she was the one who arranged the car accident.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rita snorted, &quot;I will definitely find out how my bodyguard got into an accident. It must be connected to you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rita didn&#x27;t give Queenie a chance to explain and instructed her bodyguard to continue playing the video.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, another video appeared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It showed Diana hearing the cry for help and jumping into the swimming pool to save Rita.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone was shocked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Holy crap. It was Diana who saved Madam Farley. Queenie stole the credit.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;From the video, Queenie didn&#x27;t slip accidentally but rather jumped in when no one was around. She just took the credit.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The guests began discussing the revelation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Steven looked at Diana, realizing he had once again misunderstood her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He called out, &quot;Diana...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As he approached, Diana turned around and left, looking at the astonished Cecil.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cecil met her cold gaze and then averted his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thinking about yesterday&#x27;s slap and the cruel words he had just spoken, he felt truly ashamed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rita looked at Diana and said, &quot;Ms. Bishop, you saved my life. Say whatever you want.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Diana replied, &quot;Madam Farley, I won&#x27;t take anything from the Farley family, but your grandson slapped me yesterday. Today, I want to repay him tenfold and cut off his hands. That&#x27;s what I want.&quot;</p><p><span style="color:#222222"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">Rita&#x27;s expression instantly turned stern.</span></span></span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="25.html">« Prev</a><a href="27.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
