Not yet. Not until she had uncovered all the forces behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to hold back, visibly calm, but fiercely burning inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't going to lose to this little nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Queenie and smiled faintly, "So, you feel better knowing my father's identity isn't clear? Do you think you can step on me now? Go ahead. It'll hurt a little, but if it makes you feel good, keep saying things like that. I'm not going to lose a piece of myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze and thought, "Is Diana really this angry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana," she said smugly, "I told </span><span>you,</span><span> you'll end up with nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie wanted Diana to lose everything so she could finally feel at peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied gleam danced in Queenie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow, looking at her coolly. "We're not at the end yet. No one knows how this will turn out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced indifferently at Queenie, then waved her hand for Luna to push her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dylan stepped before her, blocking her path, and warned Queenie, "Diana, didn't you hear me? I told you to apologize to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't apologize today, you're not leaving here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana slowly lifted her gaze to Dylan, her lips parting slightly, "Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cold, commanding voice stunned Dylan, leaving him momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, how dare you tell me to get lost? You shameless bastard, you don't even know who your father is! If it weren't for my mom's kindness, you wouldn't be here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's heart hurt sharply again. How she wished she hadn't come from Paula's womb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted in fury, "Dylan, I didn't choose to be born, and I didn't choose the fate where Jeff swapped me and Queenie. But if you say one more word, you'll crawl back today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tolerate a lot, but hearing him call her a bastard over and over made her furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her real father's identity was unclear, but she believed he loved her more than anyone else could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the mix-up with the paternity test, she was convinced her biological father had always been secretly protecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh," Dylan sneered, looking at her with a smirk, enjoying seeing her upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without her meddling, their family would not have fallen apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a year, Diana had torn their family apart, and Frank's life hung in the balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you've caused chaos in our family. Do you really think I'll let you off easy? You're apologizing to Queenie today, whether you like it or not. If you don't, none of you are leaving here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned, silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Nick and Barry were furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, should we beat him up?" Nick asked, knowing Dylan was her brother but still wanting to check with her first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This jerk is trying to drive Ms. Marsh into a corner, accusing us of causing trouble. What an idiot. I don't want to hear another word from him," Nick thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow at Dylan. "Sure, let's give him a little welcome gift. Let him experience the consequences of being arrogant and show him what happens when you talk too much. He's got a filthy mouth. Let's teach him some manners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!" Dylan scoffed, completely dismissing Nick and Barry. "You think these two pretty boys can take me on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, these two might look good, but are you sure they can handle me? I've had a year of training overseas. I'm strong, and if they want to try, I'll be happy to see how well these two handle themselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was furious. "Nick, Barry, don't be polite. This guy can't talk properly. Teach him how to use his mouth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick and Barry sighed with relief, finally having the opportunity to put this punk in his place. They had been holding back for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could anyone have such a brother? It was infuriating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knew Dylan believed her because he was even more naive than the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still had plans to use him to get everything back from Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Paula's fate, she would end up locked away in a mental hospital, tortured and abused by the doctors. That was her rightful end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feigning concern, Queenie said, "Diana, even though we don't share the same father, you and Dylan have the same mother. Are you really going to let your pretty boys fight him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glanced at Luna, who immediately stepped forward and raised her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's face instantly bore a bright red handprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Queenie screamed in pain, quickly shifting into a dramatic act. "Diana, I just didn't want you to fight with Dylan. Is that really such a crime?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, we're family. It's so embarrassing for outsiders to see us like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Queenie is acting up again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rubbed her temples in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie really knew how to take shamelessness to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, are you okay?" Dylan asked, his face full of concern as he looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie shook her head, looking as pitiful as she could. "Dylan, I'm fine. I didn't want you and Diana to fight. All the problems between us were because of her. She's the reason I broke ties with my brothers. I didn't want to lose you too. I didn't want to make things hard for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We had a happy family once. I can understand that Diana can't accept me, but being swapped at birth wasn't my fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them stared in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had seriously underestimated just how fake Queenie was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but mutter, "What a perfect little actress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie could play the part, and Dylan knew how to act like the good guy. They were truly cut from the same cloth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, apologize to Queenie, or I'll call the police," Dylan barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana snapped back to reality at Dylan's shout. When she heard him mention calling the police, she quickly retorted, "Go ahead and call them. Maybe the police can come and arrest us. I actually have some evidence to show them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's mind raced. She remembered the evidence related to Callie that she couldn't let get exposed. She had already come up with a plan: get Dylan close to Diana, steal her phone, and delete the evidence. After all, Dylan had been involved in that situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan furrowed his brow. "What evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie gently tugged at Dylan's hand, her eyes welling up with tears as she softly shook her head. "Dylan, please don't worry about it. It's nothing. I'm fine. I'll just put some ice on it when I get home. It was just a slap. It's okay. If it makes Diana feel better, she can slap me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh. She looked at Luna and said, "Luna, didn't you hear what Queenie just asked? She has a request, and we should help her out. Go ahead, do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna smiled, walked over, and swiftly slapped Queenie on the other side of her face.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1036.html">« Prev</a><a href="1038.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
