She turned and asked, "Steven, aren't you coming with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have something else to do. Just go home first," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling unwell, Queenie looked at him with sad eyes. "Steven, my stomach isn't right. Can't you stay with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven held back his frustration. "If you're not feeling well, I'll take you back to the hospital. I'm not a doctor, and there's nothing I can do for a stomachache."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie understood he was twisting her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Steven..." she pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My ride is here. Just go home and rest," he said, signaling the driver to pull away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Queenie cried. "Steven, you're really leaving me alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her voice was swallowed by the wind and snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fierce determination, she stared ahead. She had hesitated before, but now that she was pregnant, she couldn't afford to hesitate any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Steven could protect her in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Levi was a famous actor, his family's stability didn't compare to Steven's.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conflicted, Queenie realized she needed a solid plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instructed the driver to take her to Amelie's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she returned home, she found the place was deserted and a mess. Queenie felt speechless. Although she had hired two servants, Amelie insisted on cleaning herself, but clearly, it wasn't going well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disappointment washed over Queenie when she discovered there was no dinner prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went upstairs and found Jeff sleeping soundly on the couch. The lack of warmth made the place feel even less like home.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she lived with Paula, there would always be a meal waiting for her when she returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula had loved her dearly since childhood, showering her with gifts worth millions. If Queenie liked something, Paula would buy it without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had hoped that Amelie, her biological mother, would share that same affection, but what she found was far from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the living room in a daze, Queenie couldn't help but ask herself, "Is this the life I want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always believed that even without Paula and her four brothers, they could be happy as a family.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet every time she came back, she was filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, you're back." Amelie stirred from a nap, her hunger prompting her to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie noticed the bruises on Amelie's face and asked, "Mom, what happened to your face?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie's expression shifted to one of distress. "Your father and Paula hit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Queenie was angry. She looked at Jeff, still asleep on the couch, and her fury intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie noticed Queenie's gaze on Jeff, and she led her into the room, asked her to sit down, and said nervously, "Queenie, Paula found out about Mark and me, and your father saw the proof. He beat me, and when I tried to taunt Paula, she recognized me as the woman Jeff was having an affair with. She followed us here and discovered our history. Furious over Jeff's betrayal, she took it out on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in pain all over."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's your relationship with Mark?" she asked, feeling helpless. Deep down, she knew Amelie's affair with Mark was true, but it hadn't mattered to her until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelie wept. She then wiped her tears and said, "Queenie, I can't rely solely on your father. He's a failure; without Paula, he's nothing. Mark and I were college friends. He loved me back then, but he couldn't marry me because I wouldn't have been able to help him in any way if he married me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later on, he got married and had a child, but he kept in touch with me. Do you think I could secure a good life for your brother just with the little money your father gives me?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeff is so stingy. Every time I asked him for money, he just gave me a little. Most of what I get comes from Mark."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stared at Amelie in shock. She hadn't paid attention to it before, but now it was starting to hit her. She and Jace had entered the room, and although she hadn't let him touch her, in his mind, she was already his.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a wave of nausea, she pressed her hand against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she whispered, "Whose son is my brother?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="626.html">« Prev</a><a href="628.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
