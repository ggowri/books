Let's meet the day after tomorrow night. I'll make the restaurant reservations. It's been ages since we last saw each other, and since Althea's not around, we can go just the two of us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana replied with a smile, "Sounds like a plan! See you then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call, Diana settled into bed, ready for a night's rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The following morning dawned bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana woke up early and shared a seafood breakfast with Leopold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mind was already buzzing with preparations for an upcoming fashion show that she was determined to make a success.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she had already lost five years, so she couldn't afford to waste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Observing her recent outings and her seemingly improved spirits, Leopold remarked, "Sweet pea, you've been looking quite well lately, and you've been out for a while. Where are you heading off to today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've found some handsome young men. Care to join me tonight to take a look?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was momentarily at a loss for words, caught between laughter and disbelief. "Grandpa, can we not discuss such risqu&eacute; topics so early in the morning?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold pressed on with a spark of excitement, "Why not? Or are you really interested in Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew Leopold had seen yesterday's news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't paid much attention to it afterward, but she trusted Alexander to handle it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The trending topics designed by Frank would surely be countered by Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, I'm planning to get a divorce. I can only date Mr. Powell after I'm officially divorced," she explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold nodded in understanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After breakfast, he was surprisingly spry, changing into a suit faster than Diana and heading out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't help but shake her head in wonder, marveling at his decades-long pursuit of love. She pondered just how selective he must be on this quest after all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She then changed and headed to the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Gellar Group, Steven had just arrived at his office when Evan entered, announcing, "Mr. Gellar, Ms. Bishop's grandfather is here and wishes to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven, recalling the old man, promptly said, "Please, bring him up at once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evan noted the deference in Steven's tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swiftly went downstairs to escort Leopold up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Always meticulous about his appearance in public, Leopold was dressed impeccably in a light blue suit, exuding an air of nobility and vitality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing the scale of Steven's company, Leopold sneered inwardly. Steven was indeed capable, but he still didn't measure up to what Diana deserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Leopold reached Steven's office, Steven was already at the door to greet him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Bishop," Steven greeted Leopold respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, take a seat." Evan offered with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once seated, Leopold handed Steven a document, stating firmly, "Steven, I'll get straight to the point. This is a divorce agreement. I hope you'll sign it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned, realizing Leopold was here to push for a divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven settled into the chair opposite Leopold and posed his question with a serious tone, "Sir Bishop, marriage is considered sacred. So, why are you advising me to divorce Diana?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his words, Leopold felt a surge of anger so intense it nearly made him sick. "Why? Because you simply don't deserve it! You are only worthy of a woman like Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana didn't make a fuss, and she's already given you what you wanted. You should be grateful. If you dare mistreat her again, this time, I'll stop at nothing to bring your family and the Marsh family down to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When she was seventeen, she went out that day and saved you. Had she not fallen in love with you at first sight, I would have never permitted her to marry you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She dragged you out of that fire, and her entire back was scorched. Do you have any idea how long she stayed in the hospital because of that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She risked her life saving you. When she came back to the Marsh Villa and realized who you were, she still agreed to marry you. You dodged death once, only to end up in another car wreck. She fought tooth and nail to save you, even made me, an old man, trudge through snowy mountains for some precious herb to help. She poured her heart into saving you, and what did you do? You stomped all over that heart. And now, here you are, dragging your heels on the divorce. What in the world do you really want?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're so young, and already you dream of the joy of having two wives. But I'm afraid you won't be that lucky. Sign the divorce papers quickly and let Diana find her own happiness. Alexander is a much better match for her than you. I've been watching him for three years as a perfect husband for Diana."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leopold was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's eyes widened with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Bishop, did you just say that the person who saved me from the fire was Diana?" His voice trembled, and he couldn't stop his pupils from shaking.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="265.html">« Prev</a><a href="267.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
