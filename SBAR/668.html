"Cecil, it's Diana. Could you open the door, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was silence for a moment before Diana knocked again, her voice gentle but firm. "Cecil, please open the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the door swung open, and Cecil appeared, looking disoriented in his light gray pajamas.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you came," he said, as he immediately wrapped his arms tightly around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven, who was following, felt his face grow darker at the sight. Seeing Cecil's tear-stained face, he stopped in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven thought, "What kind of man cries to attract a woman's sympathy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana patted Cecil's back reassuringly. "Cecil, it's alright now. Everything is going to be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil forced a smile through his tears. "I know you saved me. I know it was you. If not for you, do you know what would've happened to me? I think... I think I was supposed to die today."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice broke as he sobbed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was momentarily stunned. She thought, "This is strange. Even if Cecil dreamt about events from the past, why would he be so shaken?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could there be other secrets buried in his memories?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil's cries eventually quieted, but his body was still trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up at Diana with eyes that seemed both fragile and pleading, he said softly, "Diana, I'm in pain again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was struck by the contrast between Cecil's usual charming demeanor and the current look of vulnerability on his face. His pale, jade-like skin glistened with tears, and a few loose strands of hair fell across his forehead, making him look all the more delicate and haunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, it's alright. I'm here now,"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was drawn to Cecil, and her tone unconsciously softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil felt a sense of warmth spreading through him at her gentle tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Steven, who stood watching, Diana's softening expression only made his eyes grow colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned deeply, feeling that Cecil was merely putting on an act to gain sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I'm scared. Please don't leave tonight, okay? Every time I close my eyes, I feel this pain in my legs and arms. And the icy ocean... it's so cold, so cold."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you were thrown into the ocean?" she asked, regretting the words as soon as they left her mouth. She hadn't meant to bring it up when he was already so frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I dreamed about it. It was terrifying, and now my whole body hurts," Cecil said, his voice filled with pain as if he were trying to endure a deep sense of fear and agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His long eyelashes quivered as he spoke. This nightmare had been haunting him for a long time, and all the pain and resentment he had bottled up seemed to be spilling out tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Cecil so vulnerable tugged at Diana's heart. Since she had met him, she had never seen him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's okay. I'll stay with you. Don't be afraid," Diana said, leading him by the hand into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven followed them, his anger simmering. His wife was planning to spend the night comforting another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, forcing down his fury, and stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana helped Cecil sit on the bed, but suddenly, he pulled her into a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stiffened, taken aback. She wasn't used to being this physically close to anyone, not even Steven.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, will you really stay with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice filled with uncertainty and a longing gaze fixed on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brief moment, Diana felt as if tonight's nightmare had stripped away all of Cecil's natural arrogance, leaving behind a fragile and gentle side she had never seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cecil, don't push your luck. Let go of my wife."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="667.html">« Prev</a><a href="669.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
