His real name is indeed Charlie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I found the name of Stella Pharmaceutical Company, so I reported them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I planted people inside the company. The virus they discarded was intercepted by my people, so it was eventually seized by the authorities."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never expected that Steven had already set everything up without her knowing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stayed up for three days and nights, worrying about those things for nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, since someone else was worrying for her, she felt very relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well... Steven, I underestimated you. Turns out everything is under your control," Diana said, her voice filled with exhaustion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her admiring look, Steven couldn't help but smile and ask, "Diana, do you think I'm amazing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought about his achievements over the years. If it weren't for him being deceived by Queenie, he truly would be remarkable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be honest, he is someone who lacks love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh, realizing she was making excuses for Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she still spoke the truth. "In my eyes, you've always been amazing. The things I find nearly impossible, you handle effortlessly. You're truly remarkable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, after being reborn, she didn't become enemies with Steven. Even if she disliked him, she always maintained a calm facade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in her previous life, she had witnessed his ruthless methods.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, she hadn't suffered the hardships of her previous life after being reborn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this life, after being reborn, she wasn't here to suffer but to enjoy life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gazed at her deeply. Seeing the sincerity in her eyes, he finally smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two continued watching the live stream. Suddenly, Diana's eyes widened as she noticed Edward, who had been abroad for years, appearing in the live stream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, I am Andrew's father. I can testify that every word my son said is true. From the car accident to his vegetative state, it was all a scheme meticulously planned by Mr. Charlie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To carry out their plan, they even used horrifying genetic modification technology to make their son look exactly like my grandson."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Over the years, to combat the Mysterium Organization, I have been secretly cooperating with the authorities to gather evidence. After twenty-five years of effort, I finally obtained all the evidence and eradicated this evil organization completely."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for this virus incident, it was planned by Charlie to gain illicit profits. While we were focused on investigating the Mysterium Organization, he took the opportunity to release the virus. Such heinous actions will undoubtedly lead to his eternal downfall."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, please rest assured. The doctors at Hugo Hospital, Diana and Professor Cullen's team, have developed a special medicine. With approval from the authorities, the medicine is now available on the market, and we will distribute it for free. You can go to Hugo Hospital to collect it, and then your health will gradually recover."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was stunned. "Free?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Steven and said, "Steven, you need to be a bit more frugal this time. The cost of the special medicine isn't that low."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven smiled and said, "Diana, this happened because of us. We must take full responsibility."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana thought for a moment and realized they indeed couldn't stand by and do nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sigh! By the time our special medicine is distributed and the virus is under control, we might end up in debt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven couldn't help but laugh. "Diana, it's not that dramatic. I'll earn money to support you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana rolled her eyes at him. "Who needs your support? I haven't even touched the ten billion dollars my grandpa gave me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll have the company allocate funds right now to mass-produce the special medicine as quickly as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven had long expected that she would never stand by and do nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, people were frantically discussing in the live stream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[I know Diana. I never expected her to be so useful at a critical moment, and I certainly didn</span><span>'</span><span>t expect her to be a doctor!]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[These bastards are terrifying! They want us to bear the consequences of their decades-long conspiracy. We only blew up their lab base, but that's still not enough. We should tear them to pieces!]</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Queenie was shocked after seeing the news.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately called Mario to halt the special drug production plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's company distributing the special drug for free not only ruined her plan but also cost her hundreds of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..." Queenie screamed in frustration, "Useless! You're all useless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I've fallen into Diana's hands once again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Free? How does Diana have so much money?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie screamed in frustration, but she quickly forced herself to calm down. Since something happened to George, all his companies now belonged to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she quickly headed to George's office.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, George had already married her abroad to appease her. As the heir, she would inherit all of George's assets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Edward's words, Charlie sneered, "Dad, I am your real son! Who is this useless guy in the wheelchair? Why are you helping an outsider to frame your own son?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Edward, in his seventies, had a head full of silver hair, he was full of energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, please bear witness today that I have nothing to do with this heartless beast. I</span><span>'</span><span>ve brought a medical team and will conduct a public paternity test live from multiple angles."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reporters on-site felt excited, angry, and shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlie finally panicked. If they conducted the test on-site, he would be completely exposed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, Dad, I</span><span>'</span><span>m your real son. You can</span><span>'</span><span>t do this to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then can you treat my son, grandson, and his wife like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here, I also want to announce that my only granddaughter-in-law is Diana. Four years ago, she married Steven."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To ensure her safety, we did not disclose her marriage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie is Charlie's family, and she has registered with George abroad. Queenie is George's rightful wife."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The 'Steven' everyone has seen during this time is actually George."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Edward finished speaking, George was dragged into the live broadcast room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>George shouted, "Dad, save me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlie closed his eyes in despair, thinking, "It's all over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andrew is not dead, and Edward has been investigating their organization abroad all these years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stomped her feet in anger. "Edward is too much!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, Grandpa, what's going on? You clearly know I want a divorce, and Grandma also supports me divorcing. Now you suddenly make our marriage public&mdash;doesn't this directly turn me into a man who's already been married once?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Steven's eyes dimmed. She was determined to divorce.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a deep breath and said, "Diana, we need to go to the scene."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana reluctantly said, "Why do we have to go over?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1082.html">« Prev</a><a href="1084.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
