I'll come to accompany you in a few days. Now you are the only one at home. Please stay safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar nodded dejectedly. It was difficult to find someone who could treat her sincerely, so she liked Diana a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, the person who poisoned Steven's mother has not been found yet. Well, she's had a really hard life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I never tortured her and treated her like a daughter when she married Steven's father. However, what Steven's father did make her hate our family to the core."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar felt heavy-hearted whenever she thought of Steven's mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one knew how big the future storm would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her poor grandson Steven might be devoured by those illegitimate children out there at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana comforted her in a low voice, "Grandma, Steven's mother is blessed by God. She's living a good life now. She has always understood your good intentions. Too bad she has feelings for Steven's father, which is why she was hurt so deeply."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana knew what was going on. Steven didn't even know about that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He treated his enemy as his savior, but she couldn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was not the right time yet. She had to wait a little longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Helen Gellar sighed. She was too old to protect Steven for his whole life. Now she could only make him grow up as quickly as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, I'd like to sleep for another while." Mrs. Helen Gellar felt exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana said, "Okay, Grandma. You'll be tired these days, so get as much rest as you can. I'll see you the day after tomorrow when I have time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, I'm waiting for you," Mrs. Helen Gellar said lovingly and closed her eyes to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana tucked her in and walked out quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She closed the door, went downstairs, and saw Steven in the living room. His tall figure made the spacious and bright room gave off an oppressive vibe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven had mixed feelings the moment he saw Diana. She turned out to be the designer he was looking for two years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana didn't delve into Steven's complicated look and forgot about what he said about studying abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When you no longer loved someone, you couldn't help but ignore what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana picked up the bag on the table and said, "I'm going back. Grandma is fine now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven said in a deep voice, "I'll drive you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. I drove here by myself." Diana refused firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven frowned and walked to her side. "I'll drive you home and then go to the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana took a defensive step away and looked at Steven warily. She thought he had a different attitude somehow. "Don't bother. I'm going to Alexander's company soon. It's not... not convenient for you to follow me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Steven's face suddenly darkened as he thought, "She's actually blatantly cheating on me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she said it was inconvenient?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Are they going to do something I can't know about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Diana, don't forget you're still my wife," Steven roared in a low voice, "And you should keep your distance from other men."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was speechless, her face full of disdain. "Oh please. You didn't even admit you were with me before, but now you're calling me your wife? Please, just do it like you used to and leave me alone. If you want a divorce, I'm open to it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana walked out after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bang..." Steven kicked the coffee table in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His handsome face darkened, his hands on his hips. He was so angry that he had lost his composure, and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He kicked the table too hard and his foot hurt, so he hopped twice on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana heard a loud noise. She turned around, only to see Steven hop in pain, and couldn't help laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel so good!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This bastard finally got his ass kicked," Diana thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Diana's hearty laughter, Steven turned and looked towards the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her brilliant smile and unrivaled beauty made his heart instantly miss a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and asked, "Mr. Gellar, why are you masochistic?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="427.html">« Prev</a><a href="429.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
