Did you manage to find one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan replied, "Mr. Gellar, I've checked all the villas in the area, but none are suitable. The villas around here are all in great demand. There are very few vacancies, and none are on the market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villas in this area were highly sought after and owned mainly by prominent families. Getting one was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven frowned. In his mind, money could solve anything. "Keep looking. Find a decent agent and ask around. Offer a high price if you have to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan hesitated for a moment before deciding to speak. "Mr. Gellar, the issue between you and Ms. Bishop isn't about where you live; it's about what you did before and how it broke her heart. If you really want to win her back, why not treat her well from now on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She loves you </span><span>so much, I think it may stand a chance</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's frown deepened. He had no patience for this kind of talk. The villa he and Diana used to live in had been designed entirely to Queenie's tastes. It wasn't just Diana; he didn't want to return there either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Queenie being involved with some lowlife disgusted Steven. He was grateful now that he'd never been intimate with Queenie. The extent of their contact was her leaning against his chest, nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven recalled how Diana must've felt watching him and Queenie together. The same kind of gut-wrenching pain and anger he now felt seeing Diana with Cecil and Alexander. It wasn't a feeling anyone could easily shake off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed his eyes, and memories of their time together flooded back like an unstoppable tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's stomach had always been troublesome, and Diana constantly tried to help him manage it. No matter how late he came home, Diana would prepare some midnight snacks, waiting for him to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had been gone for nearly a year, and Steven struggled more and more. His stomach problems flared up often, and there was no one to take care of him, to ask how he was, or to remind him to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven used to find Diana's constant concern irritating, thinking she was only good for doing such trivial things. Now, he realized that those small, seemingly insignificant gestures were things no one else had ever done for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a low voice, Steven said, "Let's go to the office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Gellar," Evan smiled and drove toward the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had been living at the office lately. It had been long since he went home. The office felt more like home than his actual house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Queenie arrived home to find Jeff collapsed. Panic surged through her as she turned to Tracey. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, what happened to my dad? Why did he pass out again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was puzzled. Jeff's health had been deteriorating recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey glanced at Queenie, then shifted to Eric, who stood awkwardly nearby. She directed all her frustration at him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, it's all because of your mother! Queenie only took 200 million dollars from her. Paula's filthy rich. What difference does 200 million make to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tracey added, "Today, Paula brought up the issue again when she got home. She claimed the company was short on funds and demanded the money back. She argued with Jeff, which made him faint."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric frowned at Tracey. He thought, "She knows the truth, but her words are always twisted. Before, I might have believed her and blamed my mom. What's the harm in giving Queenie 200 million dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing things </span><span>through</span><span>, Eric realized how deliberate Tracey's words were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric said, "Grandma, you make it sound so easy. My mom's company is about to go under. Do you know what 200 million dollars means to a company on the brink of collapse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't understand, don't talk nonsense. What's the point of yelling at me? If you're so tough and capable, why don't you save the company yourself?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="521.html">« Prev</a><a href="523.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
