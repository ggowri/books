"He was wearing a black windbreaker and standing with his back to me. I don't remember who he was. And I haven't heard Queenie mention him."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes were disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil was also very distressed. He wanted to remember more, but he couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Forget it. We will meet again. This time we can start all over. Don't just think about revenge. Work hard to make the company stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only with great strength can we withstand all difficulties.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will strive to be rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Cecil with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still had a lot of things to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil sniffed and said, "Okay! Let's go for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at his childish appearance and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita blinked and heaved a sigh of relief. Cecil escaped with his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said lovingly, "Come on. Let's have breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana helped Rita stand up and went to the kitchen together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breakfast was well prepared. Diana and Cecil chatted while eating. And the atmosphere was warm and happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rita was also relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing breakfast, Cecil went to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was going back home. It was still early.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snow stopped last night. The morning sunlight was a little dazzling, so she drove very slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was turning a corner. And a man suddenly rushed out and fell in front of her car. Diana slammed on the brakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in surprise. What happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered if she had hit someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the person rushed out by himself. This should be a scam.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly opened the car door and got out, only to see Lily covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help... Please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was shocked. "Mrs. Foliot, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at the villa next to her. Lily might climb up from the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's whole body turned purple from the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana helped her up and dragged her into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Diana entered the cab and turned the heater to the highest setting.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana drove quickly to the hospital, calling Tom.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Diana, do you want to have breakfast with me?" Tom asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said anxiously, "Tom, I will treat you to breakfast next time. I have an emergency patient here, and I need you to help me. Please be ready and keep the treatment confidential."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom said, "Secret treatment? What kind of patient?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hesitated for a moment and said, "I picked her up on the road."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom said, "Congratulations, you are worthy of being a doctor. Lucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Please get ready first. I will get there as quickly as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, no. It's not safe to drive in this heavy snow. Slow down. As long as the person is still alive, we can save her. Be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom reminded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled and said, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Lily. Lily had exposed Amelie's affairs last night and got hurt now.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "Who did it? Queenie or Mark?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa wasn't Foliot Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was Lily there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned on the heater on the seat and looked at Lily's legs with some concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Mrs. Foliot, we'll be at the hospital soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily had fainted and could not hear anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forty minutes later, Diana drove the car to the hospital's underground garage.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="673.html">« Prev</a><a href="675.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
