But it was just a list of names&mdash;he couldn't make sense of why Diana had written them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he flipped to the next page, what he saw hit him like a ton of bricks. It read: [Steven, Queenie, Jeff, Paula, Frank, Gale, Eric, Dylan&mdash;In this lifetime, I, Diana, will never want anything to do with any of you again.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven's eyes widened in shock, and he thought to himself, "So, she really doesn't want me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, staring at her elegant handwriting as he muttered to himself, "Diana, do you think you can just say you're done and that's it? You were the one who said you loved me. Now you're saying you don't? In this lifetime, it's not over between us until I say it's over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven gripped the notebook tightly in his hands, vowing that he wouldn't let Diana leave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized then that he had driven away the only woman in the world who had truly loved him, all because of that woman, Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven closed the notebook, and a surge of possessiveness flooded his heart. He stood up, went to his car to grab some fresh clothes, and headed straight to Diana's bathroom. After taking a shower, he came out dressed in pajamas and lay down directly next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's bed smelled sweet and felt soft, and her blanket was light and fluffy, much more comfortable than his own bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been married for two years, yet they had never shared a bed. But tonight, they finally were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven watched Diana sleep deeply, knowing how exhausted she was. For the first time, he was enjoying being in the same bed with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, their closeness didn't bring the slightest bit of discomfort or resistance. Instead, a strange sense of harmony quietly began to grow. Steven slept soundly, so much so that he didn't even dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft morning light filtered through as Diana slowly opened her eyes. Suddenly, she sensed someone next to her, and there was a strong arm wrapped around her waist, pressing down on her uncomfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly glanced over, and what came into view was a face so strikingly handsome it took her breath away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were closed, long lashes fanning out like delicate feathers, each one clearly visible. His sleeping face was incredibly pleasing to the eye, with his perfect facial features appearing even softer in the stillness of slumber as if he were a masterpiece carefully sculpted by the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was stunned, wondering, "Am I seeing this right? How did Steven end up in my bed? When did this jerk sneak in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up, ignoring the pain throughout her body, and shouted, "Steven!" Yesterday's fall had been rough, and now her entire body ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven was startled awake by Diana's angry voice. He glanced at her, seeing her face flushed with anger, and frowned slightly. "Why are you yelling this early in the morning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a sarcastic laugh. "Why am I yelling? Steven, how dare you climb into my bed?! Get off! Don't you know I find you filthy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Steven heard that, a cold glint flashed in his eyes. He fixed his deep gaze on Diana and said, "Diana, do you have to be so harsh? Who's filthy? You meet different men every day, have I ever said anything about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tilted her chin high, not backing down one bit. "Why should you care? Get out of my bed, and from now on, you're not allowed in my house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven slowly sat up. He hadn't slept so deeply in a long time. Last night, he had slept soundly, feeling refreshed and in a good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled faintly, the corners of his lips curving up as a gentle look appeared in his eyes. "Diana, do I need to remind you again? We're married. What's the problem with us sleeping together?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="484.html">« Prev</a><a href="486.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
