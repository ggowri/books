Steven's voice was low as he hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan hesitated, muttering to himself, "How am I supposed to eat in front of that ice-cold face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he knew he couldn't just skip it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing the door ajar, he stepped inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven was already seated at the dining table, fork in hand, enjoying his breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The spread included egg pancakes, steak, and milk&mdash;all his favorites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had always been satisfied with the breakfast Diana prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven pondered, "When did everything start to change?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It all went downhill after Queenie returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All her tricks were only possible because of my indulgence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan sat down across from him, eyeing the delicious spread. "Thanks for the breakfast, Mr. Gellar," he said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven took a bite of the black pepper steak before asking, "Did you look into what I asked you about last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar, you really do have a knack for predicting things. The Farley family's branch office has been facing issues lately, but they can't seem to pinpoint the cause. Cecil's been handling it, but so far, no luck. They've already lost two partnerships, which is a real shame."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven narrowed his eyes, recalling Diana's earlier words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He lowered his gaze and continued eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Noticing the silence, Evan picked up his pace, eager to fill the void.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"By the way, Mr. Gellar, was Queenie here last night? I saw Ms. Bishop come in, but she left right away. A few minutes later, Queenie came out too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Steven's expression darkened as he shot Evan a look. "How could Queenie possibly stay here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan couldn't help but interject, "Mr. Gellar, don't forget that a few months ago, Queenie was allowed to stay here. The guest room is still stocked with her designer clothes and personal items.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And she could waltz into your room anytime. Remember how Ms. Bishop mentioned that this place was home for both of you, so Queenie coming over wasn't appropriate? You remember what you said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, Steven remembered. Back then, he had thought he was going to marry Queenie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The tension between Diana and Queenie had been unbearable, especially with all the company troubles piling up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had been on edge, and his frustration often spilled over onto Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Setting down his fork, Steven said, "Get someone to throw out all of Queenie's clothes upstairs. From now on, she's not allowed back here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan blinked, nearly moved to tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Gellar! Congratulations! You've finally seen the light. Before Queenie came back, you and Mrs. Gellar were doing so well. You couldn't see, and you couldn't stand on your own. Caring for someone in your condition is no walk in the park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But Mrs. Gellar never complained. She helped you with therapy, took care of you, cooked for you&mdash;she was always running around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In Queenie's eyes, all that hard work was reduced to nothing more than being a caretaker."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evan chuckled as he polished off his breakfast, then called someone to come and clear out Queenie's belongings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Diana was seething as she headed to the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The thought of Steven and Queenie's shameless antics made her blood boil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since Queenie's return, she had constantly meddled in their relationship. Diana had given Steven countless chances, but he only had eyes for Queenie, always forgiving her misdeeds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Diana no longer loved him, the memories still stung.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Diana pushed open the office door, her eyes blazing with fury as she took in the scene before her.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="168.html">« Prev</a><a href="170.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
