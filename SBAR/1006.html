She looked down at Diana with a mocking smile. In Queenie's eyes, she had always stood above Diana, gazing down on her from a place of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, the word 'lose' has never been part of my life. One day, I'll make you pay for everything I've endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once upon a time, you were too foolish to save. Did Steven ever thank you for your kindness? No. Not only did he never thank you, he hurt you deeply. And now, he's with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at Queenie's smug expression, then laughed softly. "Just a jerk. You always love to pick up the trash I don't want. Here, take him. He's all yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take those brothers who worship you, and my mom who adores you more than anyone else. If you're so into them, go ahead&mdash;they're all yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The world doesn't stop just because I'm walking away from all of you. Getting away from people like you&mdash;people who make me sick&mdash;makes me feel better every single day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's fragile emotions shattered beyond repair when she saw Diana effortlessly discard everything she had clung to. Her eyes burned with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Queenie took were the things Diana had already thrown away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, after she'd taken them, they tossed her aside like garbage. The people she'd stolen from now hated her with everything they had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the schemes she had plotted, all the manipulations, had only led her further astray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie suddenly turned to Diana, her voice laced with anger. "Diana, I underestimated you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Queenie, so you never saw me as a threat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold had once told Diana never to underestimate any of her enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie paused, and while it might seem like that, everything she'd done was aimed at hurting Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All along, she'd seen Diana as her biggest rival. But it was only at this moment that she realized she'd been caught in Diana's game without ever really understanding what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her target had always been Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never really considered Steven a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was always a battle with Diana, but in her mind, she had belittled Diana, never thinking that Diana was her true enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd lost to Diana every time, but she just couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much did she truly despise Diana to entertain such arrogant thoughts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie sneered, "Diana, one day, I'll get back everything I've lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't believe it. Not for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cold wind, Diana's expression was ice-cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, if you still had Paula's love, I'd believe you could get everything back. I've seen how far she would go for you, how she'd risk everything for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you would just focus on being her daughter&mdash;supported by her billions of dollars, adored by your four brothers, and with Steven loving you as deeply as he does&mdash;you'd be the happiest princess in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how much I used to envy you? All you had to do was frown, and your whole family would revolve around you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Barnes, concerned about your mood, would deliberately insult me, belittle me&mdash;just to make you smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your four loving brothers would tease me just to see you happy. You see, you've always been surrounded by so much love, but you're too blind to appreciate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thrown away a winning hand, and in return, she had suffered a thousand times over because of those very people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie's chest ached terribly, her whole body in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had truly been blinded, ruining everything with her own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had used Paula and Steven's power to climb higher, life would have been easier now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been wrong&mdash;so wrong, it was almost absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had hurt the people who loved her most&mdash;her mother, who cared for her deeply, and her brothers, who truly wanted the best for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the people who loved her slowly drifted away, one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one was willing to be hurt, and no one would love someone driven by selfish ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood it all, yet still, she charged ahead, unable to turn back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she stayed down for too long, eventually, she'd snap out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears in her eyes, Queenie looked toward where Diana had been, but Diana and Cecil were already gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even know when they had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver glanced at Queenie with sympathy, his voice quiet as he asked, "Ms. Marsh, should we head back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie nodded slightly. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was soft, weighed down with sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this really how her life was going to end? Defeated, once and for all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her past confidence had come from Steven and Paula, from the love and adoration of her four brothers. That was what had given her the strength to hurt Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie blinked, staring at the foggy sky in the distance. Fine raindrops began to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her face, letting the light rain fall onto her skin. The cold droplets felt sharp against her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this had happened in the past, her four brothers would have rushed over to give her a jacket, take her home, and fuss over her well-being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as she cried, no one was there to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold had set in, and there was no one to offer her warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie had become the very image of loneliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, this was how Diana had looked&mdash;isolated and alone. Now, Diana was the shining star, the admired CEO, living the life Queenie had always wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie stood in the wind, tears streaming down her face, shivering from the deep, biting cold. It felt like the wind had torn her heart, and every part of her ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver gently helped Queenie into the car. She sank into the backseat, curling up, her gaze distant as she stared out the window, silently crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver glanced at her but said nothing. He quietly started the car and drove her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Cecil turned to look at Diana, noticing she seemed upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, he asked, "Diana, we just saw Queenie at her lowest point, and this project has no chance of success. Why aren't you happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wasn't happy. If she could, she would prefer to live a simple, peaceful life, not one filled with deception and manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She curled her lips into a small smile. "Cecil, she's quite capable. Who knows, maybe tomorrow morning we'll see a brand-new Queenie who manages to fix everything perfectly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil stared at her, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How was it that Queenie was like a cockroach, impossible to kill no matter how many times you tried?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecil, always on edge, couldn't afford to let his guard down when it came to Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called his assistant, instructing them to keep a close watch on Queenie's every move. If she so much as made a single move, he would be ready to act immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, on the other hand, forced herself to focus. The events had already unfolded, and there was no escaping them. Just then, her phone vibrated, and she saw a message from Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mood instantly brightened. She turned to Cecil and said, "Cecil, I feel so much better now. Let's go. It's time for the next act."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1005.html">« Prev</a><a href="1007.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
