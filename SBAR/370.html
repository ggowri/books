I am not afraid of Queenie," he assured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana smiled and regarded his captivating face. "Don't boast. The question is not whether you are afraid, but whether she is having designs on you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She then brought him some fruit. "Have some fruit. I will introduce you to a few mentors. If you want to stay in the country to take care of Priya, you can study with these mentors or do research with them. You must work hard to advance. That is the best choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you are successful, maybe you can achieve your desires without having to work for anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph was moved by her sincere words and nodded vigorously. "Yes, Diana, I will study hard. I want to stay in the country to be with my grandma."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Diana said. "Then I'll help you arrange a mentor. Which university did you apply to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Capitole Tech University," Joseph replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's great. I happen to know a mentor at this school. He is a good person and can guide you to where you want to go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Diana contacted Declan Gibbs and gave Joseph his contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing his name, Joseph was surprised. "Diana, do you know Professor Gibbs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He was my mentor. But he's very strict. He will not accept you just because I recommend you. You have to rely on yourself," Diana reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, Diana. I will work hard. I've always wanted to be his student, but I never had the chance to meet him," Joseph exclaimed with excitement. He hadn't expected such a golden opportunity to come his way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, he realized why Diana considered him unqualified. Given that she had been a student of Declan's, it was likely that her skills surpassed his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph felt ashamed for ever doubting Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was his past experiences that had made him so cautious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Joseph didn't question why Diana had helped him. Knowing that she was genuine was enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, Priya was out of surgery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom appeared very weary as he explained, "Joseph, the operation was successful. Your grandma needs to take medicine on time, and she will get better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears welled up in Joseph's eyes as he expressed his gratitude, "Dr. Cullen, thank you very much!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're welcome. You also need to thank Diana. If she hadn't recommended me as the dean, I wouldn't have been able to perform the surgery for your grandma," Tom said jokingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana chuckled, "Tom, you are just trying to show off that you are the dean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom's weariness suddenly vanished, and he patted Diana on the shoulder. "Diana, I'm only 25 years old this year. Have you ever seen a 25-year-old doctor serving as a dean? Come on, I want to show off to my colleague."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom smiled and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana watched him go and said, "Tom, no one can enter this floor for the time being. You have to reapply the medicine personally?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tom was stunned. "Why?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="369.html">« Prev</a><a href="371.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
