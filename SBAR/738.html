Queenie was calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing that Queenie might be behind this, Diana answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, you got a call, didn't you? I signed you up for the designer competition. I'll be competing too. Like you said, I have real talent and a good eye for design, so in this competition two weeks from now, I'm going to beat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt a wave of exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Queenie, are you out of your mind? If you want to enter, go ahead, but why did you sign me up? Are you not sick enough of scandals already? Going as far as that old man...really, Queenie? Maybe if you focused on your career instead of collecting men, you'd get somewhere. What could you possibly gain from dragging me into this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt Queenie was ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's scathing retort left Queenie fuming. She shot back, "What's wrong, Diana? Are you afraid of competing against me? Afraid you'll lose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Diana was afraid of losing, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, since you think I'm some country bumpkin, desperate to compete with you, I'll make sure you get a clear look at just how lacking your talent really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana hung up in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head was starting to hurt, but she also knew that entering the designer competition could increase her work's visibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wasn't what she wanted, though. Based on her past-life experience, she needed to keep a low profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steven had several half-brothers waiting in the wings. Only by staying under the radar could she ensure those men wouldn't feel threatened or try to harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she shone too brightly and became an asset to Steven, her life would be at risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why she hadn't exposed Steven and Queenie's relationship yet. After all, the moment Queenie's abilities mysteriously improved, she'd be the target for Steven's half-brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of those half-brothers was undoubtedly Queenie's lover. All Diana needed to do was figure out who, and she could finally knock Queenie off her pedestal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had taken on a low-profile role as a designer to cultivate a sense of mystery. In today's digital world, as long as her clothing styles caught on, people would focus on the clothes and rarely remember the designer's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Queenie wanted her to prove her skills but also wanted to humiliate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rested her head on her desk, expressionless, thinking about how to bow out of the competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her name was already on the list, she decided she might as well go through with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sly smile crept onto her face. All she had to do was let Queenie win.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, then it would just look like an unknown designer lost to a brilliant, famous celebrity designer, giving Queenie even more attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her plan settled, Diana laughed quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Luna came in with a glass of warm milk, she saw the mischievous glint in Diana's smile and felt a shiver. She could feel that Diana was planning something.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, please calm down, that smile is terrifying." Luna set the milk on the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana tapped the desk irritably.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, Queenie's a real piece of work. She went behind my back to sign me up for that competition, clearly up to no good. I just got a call from the Fashion Association telling me to get ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna took a deep breath. "Diana, Queenie's a total snake. And today, you're actually going to bail her out and make peace with her? You're really just asking for trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana knew Luna didn't understand what she was planning. Only by releasing Queenie could she make her downfall all the more spectacular.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="737.html">« Prev</a><a href="739.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
