She completely let herself go, no longer pretending to be innocent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Diana with a smile. Queenie came to buy a dress; they would definitely attend tonight's banquet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie looked at Steven beside Diana. He was still as handsome and aloof as ever, but the sense of security he exuded was what fascinated her the most.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said helplessly, "Queenie, I saw this dress first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled at her. Diana, nourished by love, looked even more beautiful. What she envied most was Diana's face. "You haven't paid yet, have you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana said, "I haven't paid, but the dress is in my hands. Queenie, do you really like taking the things I don't want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie was slightly stunned. Diana threw the dress into her arms and said, "Since you like it, I'll let you have it. I like all the styles here. Are you going to take them all?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana provoked Queenie, curious if she would fall into the trap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie held the dress Diana threw at her, furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at her with a bright smile, casually linking arms with Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven gazed at her tenderly, admiring her proud demeanor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Darling, if you like them, I'll buy them all for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Queenie's heart ached sharply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared blankly at Steven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at her coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie knew that if Steven treated someone well, it was with his whole heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, even though he pretended to be affectionate toward her, that version of Steven was so gentle it made her unable to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at that time, Queenie didn't see her own heart clearly. If Queenie had known back then that the person she liked was Steven, she definitely wouldn't have helped George.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bet her entire life on George and lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are all her fault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie clearly knew George wasn't as good as Steven, yet she still helped him without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps it was the events of that year that made her unable to forget the melancholic boy hiding in the dark.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His identity was just like her illegitimate daughter's identity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie believed Charlie's words and thought about how easily she fell for George. She actually thought he was better than Steven back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never treated George unfairly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Queenie just turned 18, she was raped by Charlie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of this made her feel disgusted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now they are in prison and will never get out for the rest of their lives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Queenie is still alive, determined to live well and be the center of attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie smiled at Steven and said, "Steven, why bother putting on a show in front of me? I know you two don't really love each other. You hurt Diana so much because of me, she'll never forgive you. The two of you will definitely break up because your past can't be brought up. Once you mention the past, Diana will be in pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She waited for you all these years, only to be deeply hurt by you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, do you remember how you used to spoil me? Every time Diana sees you, she thinks about the past. She&rsquo;s sick of you," Queenie said with a deliberate smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just wanted Diana to remember that pain, to make her hate Steven to the core, ensuring they could never be together in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face suddenly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven tightly held Diana's hand and said coldly, "Queenie, I have always loved Diana, and you were nothing more than a tool I used to put Charlie at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If being slightly kind to you can protect the woman I love, why wouldn't I do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know why I didn't believe you even when you showed me the video framing Diana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because foolish you didn't realize at that time that my concern for you was fake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I clearly knew you were humiliated by Charlie when you turned 18, yet I still endured the disgust and acted with you, just because I wanted to protect Diana."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The times I was good to you were probably the happiest years of your life, as no man will ever pretend to treat you so well again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, the one who should suffer is you, the one with nothing is you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the future for Diana and me is happiness, while your suffering has just begun."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie's eyes filled with tears. From the very beginning, Steven knew it was all a scam."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But he walked away effortlessly, while she was deeply trapped."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie obsessively said, 'No, Steven, you clearly love me the most. You clearly care about me so much. You said you would marry me, you said you would love me. You can only love me. Everything of yours can only belong to me.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Steven, everything of yours can only belong to me," she obsessively repeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven said, "Impossible. You only know how to cling to the powerful, ignore your own parents, and enjoy playing with men. What about you is worth liking?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven is so mean!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie took a step back and bumped into Mario's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mario looked at Steven with cold eyes. Tonight, he would make Steven suffer unbearably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, calm down," Mario whispered in her ear, "don't forget tonight's plan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie calmed down, looked at Diana, and gave a strange smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She returned the dress to Diana and said, "Diana, you've had a tough time these years. Steven gave all the good things to me, not even letting you wear dresses. Now you can wear them, buy a couple more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie frowned and asked, "What are you laughing at?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at her with a radiant expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queenie, is it possible that Steven didn't want me to wear dresses to keep other men from having improper thoughts about me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie trembled all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Steven sneered and said, "Why were those dresses you wore before so revealing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Queenie asked loudly, "Why?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="1140.html">« Prev</a><a href="1142.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
