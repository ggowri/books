He's a complete failure. Only you see him as some kind of treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In your mind, I'm just a cash machine. Your son is the one you care about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew deep down that Amelie favored her brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were her in trouble, Amelie wouldn't be bending over backward like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie froze for a moment. She did love her son more, but in moments like this, her daughter was the lifesaver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her son wouldn't even bother spending 30 million dollars to save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana was her only way out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Queenie, how can you think that about me?" Amelie's voice cracked. "I care about you. Haven't you felt that over the years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man standing nearby chimed in, "Quit the waterworks. When's the money coming? You've got 30 minutes. No money? You're out of this villa, and your daughter's going straight to the casino to work it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your daughter's way more valuable than you. I did my homework. She's a big-time celebrity and a champion designer. If we take her, her life's over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she couldn't do it, he would give her a little push.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was all about intimidation. Scaring people was his specialty. He looked terrifying, but he didn't hurt anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His bulky frame made him perfect for this line of work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie, hearing his threats, was furious. "Mom, where are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm at home," Amelie sobbed. "They came here for the money. Queenie, you have to help me and your brother. I swear this is the last time. I won't bother you again, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fat man cut in with a snarl, "Tell your daughter. If she doesn't bring the money, we'll come for her tonight. She is not getting out until the debt is paid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've got half an hour. Decide."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie was shaking, her fear obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man mocked her, "Scared? What good does that do? If you'd kept your son in line, you wouldn't be in this mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No money? No gambling. It's that simple."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words stung.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie started crying, overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew Queenie cared about her reputation more than anything. Queenie would bring the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie clenched her fists, tears streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't understand why anyone thought they could walk all over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had once been the cherished young lady. But now, even casino thugs dared to threaten her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath, looked out the window, and said, "Mom, I'll have Mario bring the money. Sell the villa after this. I'll buy you a small apartment. You're on your own now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie knew Queenie was having it hard too. If something happened to her company, Queenie might not be able to feed herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie quickly agreed, "Alright. I'll sell the villa. I promise I'll talk to your brother and make sure he never gambles again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie sneered, "This is the last time. From now on, he's not my brother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie froze, realizing she hadn't told Queenie about Paula's schemes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with the thugs staring her down, she couldn't do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she tried to calm down, her phone rang again. It was Jean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A bad feeling washed over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She answered, "Hello?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jean's voice was full of mockery. "Amelie, your son's about to lose his life in a casino on Christmas. Remember when I said you'd pay for making me lose my mom? Well, now you're going to lose your son. Even if your daughter coughs up the 30 million dollars, do you think your good-for-nothing son will turn over a new leaf?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie's hand shook as rage boiled over. "Jean, you set him up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jean screamed back, "Of course I did. You ruined my dad, and you tricked my mom into abandoning me. Did you think I'd let you off the hook? You'll pay for everything you've done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie snapped, "You bitch! How dare you mess with me and my son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was 30 million dollars. That money could've been her retirement fund.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now it was gone. Not only that, but her relationship with Queenie was in tatters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew she would never get the money back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thug nearby interrupted, "Hey, when's the money coming? Our patience is wearing thin. Tell your daughter to hurry up, or we'll go find her ourselves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie, startled by his outburst, quickly hung up and stammered, "It's coming soon. My daughter's bringing it now. But I want to go with you to pick up my son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine," the man said, "once we get the money, you can take him home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was the deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amelie let out a shaky breath of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Diana stared at her cards and felt helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd lost again. The whole evening, she hadn't won a single hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm done," she said, slumping back. "Why am I the only one who keeps losing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter the lifetime, luck at cards just wasn't in for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nolan and Nick exchanged helpless looks. They'd even tried letting her win, but she just couldn't do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luna chuckled nervously, "Diana, just accept it. We've been trying to help you win, but you haven't gotten a single hand. Even Barry sat in your spot once and couldn't win either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana groaned, propping her chin on her hands. "So, what does that say about my luck?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="965.html">« Prev</a><a href="967.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
