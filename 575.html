  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made up his mind without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we'll all go together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Zoe and Kendra he was bringing along. Osborne was determined to move everyone into the Third Estate. He was set on making it their new home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After yesterday's competition, where his supporters had faced nothing but derision from the other branch bloodlines, he was more resolved than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The insults and scorn had clearly stung, and Osborne wasn't about to let them go unchallenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had taken the jabs and sneers in silence, but now it was time to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Osborne found Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac said, his worry evident, "Osborne, are you really sure about this? It's not too late to back out. We might be looked down upon, but I'd rather you stay safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm old, and my strength isn't what it once was, but I can handle this kind of humiliation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied calmly, "Isaac, no more talking. We're moving into the Third Estate today. I can't stand this anger any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's determination, Isaac didn't press further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, let's get going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, everyone was assembled. There were just over thirty of them, but they all looked at Osborne with fiery resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move out!" Osborne said, leading them out of the Ninth Estate and up the mountain towards the Third Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they made their way, the other branch bloodlines watched in astonishment. The reaction was immediate and intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Eighth Estate, where the branch bloodline of Clifford was based, people stared in disbelief as Osborne and his team from Dampston passed by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John watched them with a heavy sigh. "I can't match him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were in his shoes, even if I had somehow won first place, I wouldn't dare demand that Ransford vacate the estate. Maybe that's the difference between us," he said, a hint of frustration in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others from Clifford exchanged uneasy glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, should we check this out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said, "They're just asking for trouble. Ransford is way stronger than Dampston. Osborne challenging them seems downright reckless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reckless, you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John shot the speaker a piercing look. "Is it reckless to stand alone in a competition where everyone doubts you and still come out on top?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That man killed David and overcame the combined strength of Sam and Rodney!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he's the next in line for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! If anyone's being reckless here, it's us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as John finished speaking, everyone exchanged bewildered glances. Just the day before, he had been fuming at Osborne, but now he was defending him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made people wonder if Osborne had somehow managed to win him over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go see what's happening! You all think Osborne is making a huge mistake. I'm starting to think Ransford might be in for a surprise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he led his group to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, John had been deeply impressed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had merely beaten him and Henry, John might have still held a grudge. But Osborne had gone beyond that. He had defeated Sam and Rodney and emerged as the top winner in Branch Bloodline Competition. That level of achievement demanded respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry was similarly convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne's group passed the Seventh Estate, Henry gathered his people and decided to follow, eager to see how Osborne planned to take over the Third Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group from Dampston made their way past the Eighth, Seventh, and Sixth Estate, heading resolutely towards the third one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, people from the Donovan, Stayton, and Norlend came out to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even representatives from Yalynch and Marcelin, occupying the First Estate and Second Estate, emerged to witness the unfolding drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most spectators thought Osborne's challenge was a foolhardy move, a dangerous gamble destined to fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though David was gone, the Third Estate still had plenty of skilled fighters, including three formidable elders at Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Dampston, besides Osborne, had no real heavyweights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many onlookers sneered, ready to enjoy the spectacle of Osborne's inevitable downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the weight of their disdain but brushed it off. He stayed focused and led his group confidently towards the Third Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived, the gates of the estate were wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Larry and his entourage stood at the entrance, his faces cold and full of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you actually dared to come?" Larry said with a sneer. "You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile was calm and unshaken. "Why wouldn't I come? I'm the winner of Branch Bloodline Competition. I have every right to choose any manor on Mount Seven as the residence for Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've chosen your estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, get out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or else, we'll settle this with a fight!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
