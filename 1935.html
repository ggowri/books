  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne found himself on the western side of Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose this location because it was the furthest from Supreme Sovereign City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of getting too close to the city, nor did he plan to use Satan's Eye to spy on it from a distance. After all, Lord Malevolence was firmly in control there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to be discovered, escaping with his life would be a serious gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Play it cool! Now is not the time to provoke Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I finish gathering resources from Epochal Divine Peak, I'll head straight back to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to digest everything I've collected so far!" he muttered, gazing at the towering peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Epochal Divine Peak, much like Primordial Divine Peak, was colossal, dwarfing the other divine peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It exerted a powerful suppression on his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stood there, Osborne felt a familiar weight pressing down on him, an unsettling sensation he had only experienced at Primordial Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to stay sharp! Just because nothing went wrong at Primordial Divine Peak doesn't mean I can let my guard down! Both the God of Night and Lord Malevolence suffered serious injuries here at Epochal Divine Peak," he thought, his expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to scan the area. Despite the suppression, his Satan's Eye still allowed him to see clearly within a sixty-thousand-mile radius of Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his delight, he spotted a wealth of Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals glittering in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hop</span><span>e</span><span> the bounty at Epochal Divine Peak is just as good as what I found at Primordial Divine Peak!" he mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne ventured into Epochal Divine Peak, launching into a frantic search for Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals like a swarm of locusts descending upon a field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Primordial Divine Peak, Epochal Divine Peak was rich in resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, everything went smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just five days, he scoured six areas, netting nearly 200 thousand Miracle Elixirs and close to 300 million Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, his haul was on par with what he had gathered at Primordial Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, he had thoroughly searched the western, southern, and northern outskirts of Epochal Divine Peak, leaving only the eastern sections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, those areas were perilously close to Supreme Sovereign City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could clearly sense that the eastern outskirts were crawling with Paramount Supreme Clan warriors, and the number of Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals there was shockingly low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the Paramount Supreme Clan had already swept through and taken most of the good stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned at the realization, thinking, "What a shame! Normally, these two areas should yield around 60 thousand Miracle Elixirs and nearly 100 million Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seems the Paramount Supreme Clan beat me to it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This just goes to show how affluent they are! Unlike me, who only searched within a one-hundred-and-twenty-thousand-mile radius, they've gone deeper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it looks like they've only raided the western side of Epochal Divine Peak. Oddly enough, I haven't seen a single Deathborn around here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's almost like this place is the Paramount Supreme Clan's private garden!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Lord Malevolence and the Deathborn within Epochal Divine Peak have struck some kind of deal? Allowing the Paramount Supreme Clan free rein in the western regions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found that scenario highly plausible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the dangers of a divine peak weren't limited to the Deathborn. The greatest threat was the Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should get out of here!" Osborne decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no further gains to be had, Osborne prepared to leave Epochal Divine Peak and head back to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he felt a surge of terrifying battle energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened as he sensed the intensity of the combat energy&mdash;it was far too violent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the source of the battle was deep within Epochal Divine Peak, he could feel the powerful fluctuations clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The intensity of this battle far exceeds what an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King can unleash! Even an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King would struggle to match it!" Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't rush toward the source of the commotion out of curiosity. His respect and wariness for the divine peak had always kept him cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when he spotted more Miracle Elixirs deep within the peak using his Satan's Eye, Osborne resisted the urge to chase after them, sticking to the outer regions instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with such a fierce battle erupting in the depths of the divine peak, he was not only hesitant to investigate but was also mentally preparing himself to flee at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle energy surged, growing more intense by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused, and he could sense a variety of different energies exploding in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fire elemental energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Water elemental energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earth elemental energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Light elemental energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even life energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, weighing his options. "What kind of battle is this? Why are so many energies clashing? Could it be a free-for-all among Supernal Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should I take a peek? If I keep my distance and don't get involved, I should be fine! After all, I've got spatial power. If things go south, I can just bail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of temptation crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With so many Supernal Deity Kings fighting, who's going to notice me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, he set his resolve. "I'll take a look! But if anything feels off, I'm out of there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale of the battle energy was too extraordinary to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel that if he didn't witness it firsthand, he might regret it later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life wasn't just about caution. Sometimes, a little calculated risk was necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne convinced himself and quickly made his way toward the source of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he found himself 300 thousand miles deep into Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he was still quite far from the actual battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They must be fighting at least 1.2 million miles deep! That's almost the core area of Epochal Divine Peak! What's going on down there?" he wondered, his curiosity piqued as he quickened his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne arrived at a depth of 1.2 million miles, and the battle energy around him was nothing short of cataclysmic. The sheer force unleashed felt apocalyptic, a wild eruption of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a little closer! I should be able to see it soon!" he urged himself, pushing ahead a few more thousand miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, he caught sight of the scene unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief, his heart racing with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About 30 thousand miles away, he saw dozens of powerful Paramount Supreme Clan warriors converging on a single figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That figure was all too familiar to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Shadow Terror Fiend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, over 50 Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan were currently engaged in an all-out assault against the Shadow Terror Fiend!</span></p><div class="pagination">
