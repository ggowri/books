  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's face was ashen, his body trembling violently, and despair flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the addition of the League of Divine Descent and Eityreia Organization's two hundred Class S warriors, the tides of battle had tilted dramatically. What had once been a standoff now resembled a ruthless slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, slaughter&mdash;that was the only word for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The presence of these elite Class S warriors had completely reshaped the battlefield dynamic; their prowess was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, there were six top-tier Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, the Eityreia Organization's mastery of Stealth Arts was downright terrifying. They moved undetected, and by the time anyone noticed their presence, it was already too late&mdash;death struck before they could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more alarming was that their sights weren't even set on the Blood Demon members. Instead, they wreaked havoc within the coalition forces with unrestrained glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as energy cannons fired relentlessly at them, they pressed forward, undeterred in their bloodlust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wails of anguish filled the air, growing louder as the coalition forces, once numbering over 40 thousand, dwindled to barely 20 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than half had fallen, mostly comprised of members of over a hundred various Ancient Families and a dozen powerful factions, though quite a number of them were still from the main bloodline and branches of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining forces struggled to fend off the onslaught of the Aberrants' army, and the addition of the two hundred Class S warriors had left their ranks in utter disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaos only accelerated the slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's body shook uncontrollably, his eyes burning with fury. As he watched his comrades get massacred, madness flickered within him. Gripping the Godfather's scepter, he aimed to join the fight but found himself relentlessly entangled by Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo taunted coldly, holding Wesson at bay, "Wesson, you might as well just stay put and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enjoy the show as the Augustine family meets its end. Sit back and witness every single one of them getting wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's frantic attempts to break free were futile; Gerardo's strength dwarfed his own. Even with the Godfather's scepter, defeating Gerardo was simply out of reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was watch in horror as the coalition forces were mercilessly cut down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Blood Demon members were too preoccupied with their own battles. They were still engaged with over three hundred Class S clones, who surged toward them without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their super energy guns had become ineffective, forcing them into close-quarters combat, slowing their onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the over three hundred Class S clones weren't formidable enough to defeat the Blood Demon members outright, they were more than capable of tying the Blood Demon up, preventing any chance of rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First's brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Bryce, Greyson, and the others. "We'll handle these three hundred clones! You guys need to support the coalition forces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce and Greyson shared equally grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't anticipated the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization to coordinate so effectively in their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition forces were being slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With thousands of Aberrants' forces still pressing forward, accompanied by dozens of Class S clones and the two hundred Class S warriors on the opposing side, they felt the weight of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were six top-tier Class S fighters among them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they, with their thirty-odd Class S fighters, possibly hope to turn the tide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be nothing short of a death sentence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the coalition forces were their kin, their descendants. How could they simply stand by and watch as their family members were mercilessly butchered? They had to try, no matter the cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thirty-plus Class S warriors launched themselves into the fray with reckless abandon. However, as was expected, their desperate attempt to change the tide of battle proved futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, amidst the chaos, they swiftly found themselves ambushed by assassins from the Eityreia Organization. Before long, casualties began to mount, and the pace of their losses only quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine Estate had transformed into a veritable slaughterhouse. Each passing moment saw a fresh wave of bodies hitting the ground. Even the warriors from the League of Divine Descent and Eityreia Organization were starting to suffer injuries amid the chaos of energy blasts and frantic counterattacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it was painfully clear to anyone paying attention: the coalition forces were on the brink of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in strength was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With eight hundred Class S clones unleashed by the Aberrants and bolstered by the combined might of the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization&mdash;making it a total of one thousand Class S warriors&mdash;this was an overwhelmingly terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that the coalition forces had held on this long, managing to take down over four hundred Class S clones, was a minor victory in its own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, their fate was sealed&mdash;the outcome was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson was drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked upon the ever-strong Gerardo, then back to the coalition forces still being mercilessly slaughtered. His eyes burned with rage, his body trembling with a mix of fury and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this it? Are we really powerless to stop this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of Sebastian and Osborne flickered in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they were here, could they save the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation had taken root in Wesson's heart, suffocating any glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a long, drawn-out sigh echoed across the battlefield.</span></p><div class="pagination">
