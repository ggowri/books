  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro Ramsey, an elderly man with white hair, quickly said, "Now, all participants, please come on stage for the group draw."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A total of 109 participants will be divided into ten groups, and each prince and princess as seeded players will not be placed in the same group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each group will engage in a free-for-all. Teaming up to attack the same opponent is not allowed. In the end, the last person standing in the ring and the last one to lose the match will be the top two of the group, advancing to the top 20 together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top 20 will draw lots again, with group winners facing other group runners-up. Losers will be eliminated, and winners will advance to the top 10."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top 10 will draw lots again for elimination matches to determine the top 5."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top 5 will all compete against each other, with each person playing four matches. The final champion, runner-up, and third place will be determined based on the number of victories."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The competition rules are actually simple, and the pace is quick. All battles must conclude within a day, directly determining the final champion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to these rules, winning the championship only requires participating in one free-for-all, two elimination rounds, and four point matches."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is very satisfied with these rules."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Compared to state duel and zone duel, he still prefers this simple arena battle. Strong is strong, weak is weak, with little element of luck."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If luck has to be involved, it can only be during the draw, using luck to get into a better group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For example, if there are only nine princes and princesses competing but they need to be divided into ten groups, one group will inevitably have no prince or princess. Those in this group will definitely find it easier to make it into the top twenty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, being in the same group as Seraphina, ranked first on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, is obviously different from being in the same group as Yvonne, ranked ninth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, there is some luck involved, but not much. To make it into the top ten, or even the top five, it ultimately depends on strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, the participants were all talking eagerly, each hoping to get into the group without a prince or princess, all hoping to make it into the top twenty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Osborne didn</span><span>'</span><span>t care. To him, which group he entered didn</span><span>'</span><span>t matter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he was in the same group as Seraphina, Osborne firmly believed the first place in the group would be his."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, Osborne has always had good luck."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He was the last to step onto the stage to draw lots, and by then, everyone else had already drawn theirs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara drew the ninth group, ending up in the same group as Yvonne, who ranked ninth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy had good luck and drew the tenth group. There were no princes or princesses in the tenth group, but Brenda was there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda sneered at this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy also sneered and looked at Osborne, who was the last to draw lots."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Actually, Osborne didn't need to draw lots anymore because his luck came into play once again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The first nine groups were full, and only the tenth group was missing one person. Unless there was a mistake in the drawing, he would definitely be in the tenth group with Leroy and Brenda."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, Osborne ended up drawing the tenth group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our luck is pretty good," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara drew Yvonne, ranked ninth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, the weakest among the nine princes and princesses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And he and Leroy directly drew the tenth group."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their luck was indeed very good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At least, Clara and Leroy were both satisfied, their eyes full of fighting spirit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Brenda was also very excited, thinking, 'My luck has arrived.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I actually drew the tenth group, avoiding all the princes and princesses, and ended up in the same group as my most hated Osborne and Osborne's 'follower,' Leroy, who ranks last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, in the tenth group, the highest rank on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings is only seventeenth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, not only can I take revenge on Osborne and teach Leroy a lesson, but I can also smoothly advance to the top twenty. I might even have a chance to become the group leader. As long as I become the group leader, I can avoid other group leaders in the first elimination round."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The first place in other groups will definitely be those princes and princesses, while my opponent will be the second place from another group. This way, I even have a chance to enter the top ten. Even if I end up only ranking tenth, that would be enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My name will echo throughout the Glorious Divine Kingdom, becoming the top warrior among those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness, aside from the princes and princesses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Brenda was extremely excited, as if she could already see herself becoming the group leader and successfully entering the top ten."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On the other hand, Mason's expression was a bit grim because he was placed in the first group, the same group as Seraphina, who ranks first on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it were another prince or princess, I might have a chance to become the group leader. After all, it's a melee, and anything can happen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But to be in the same group as Princess Seraphina, I can only aim for second place in the group. Luckily, the second place also has a chance to enter the top ten."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I really envy Brenda. She's in the tenth group, and there</span><span>'</span><span>s no one strong in that group. If I were placed in the tenth group, I could easily take the first place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, not only could I teach Osborne a lesson, but I'd also have a high chance of making it into the top ten."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! I'm ranked tenth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, so why didn't they treat me as a seed player and put me directly into the tenth group?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mason felt a bit upset but didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare to say anything and could only quickly adjust his mindset."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, the grouping was already complete."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Some were happy, some were worried. The happiest were naturally the participants of the tenth group, as they all felt they had entered the easiest group and had the best chance of advancing to the top twenty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But no matter how the groups were divided, it couldn't be changed now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, the group battles of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel officially begin. The first group stays on the stage, everyone else steps down and waits," Zorro said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, Clara, and Leroy left the stage and then looked toward the platform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The melee of the first group is about to begin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the first group could be called the group of death, as it included Seraphina, ranked first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and Mason, ranked tenth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In addition, there was one contestant ranked in the top 20, two in the top 30, and three in the top 50 of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In other words, seven out of the eleven people in the first group are ranked in the top 50 of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This group's competition will be extremely intense."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, apart from Seraphina calmly standing at the very center of the arena, everyone else looked serious, even Mason felt the pressure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The second place in this group won't be easy to secure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fight!" With Zorro's command, an intense battle erupted on the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Except for Seraphina, the other ten took out their respective Sacred Artifacts. After selecting their targets, they unleashed Sacred Power wildly and engaged in fierce combat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Notably, to speed up the pace of the battle, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel prohibits the use of any Defensive Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, with Defensive Sacred Artifacts, it would be hard to break each other's defenses when their strengths are similar, making it difficult to determine the winner quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With a loud boom, terrifying battles erupted in every corner of the arena. Soon, someone was defeated, blood spraying wildly, and was knocked off the stage."</span></p><div class="pagination">
