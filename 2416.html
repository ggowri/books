  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, the arrow exploded. The unleashed power engulfed the Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy attacking Clara and Leroy, yet it didn't harm Clara and Leroy at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was one of Osborne's gains </span><span>from</span><span> his previous training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His control over power had reached an extremely formidable level, allowing him to fully command the Sacred Power Arrow even after it had been shot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's powerful arrow force, the Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy around Clara and Leroy were </span><span>taken down one by one.</span><span> However, more Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivies remained hidden in the desert, surging toward Clara and Leroy like a tide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy couldn't see the dangers hidden in the sand, but Osborne saw them clearly through Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Clara and Leroy are not out of danger yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" Osborne urged Flash to rush over quickly while drawing the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow was still a low-grade Sacred Artifact, after being nurtured by the Warfare Ancient Tree for some time, it had become much stronger than before, and the speed of condensing arrows was also faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shouted, "The first form of Solar Sacred Arrow, Meteor Arrow Tempest!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a Sacred Power Arrow swiftly formed again on the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. This was Osborne's first time using the Solar Sacred Arrow, which he had recently mastered, in actual combat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the Sacred Power Arrow shimmered with light, swiftly shooting out, quickly reaching near Clara and Leroy, and then began to split.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A single Sacred Power Arrow split into nine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The nine split into eighty-one!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eighty-one split into seven hundred twenty-nine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, they kept splitting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a single Sacred Power Arrow split into thousands of arrows, like a meteor shower, falling toward Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in Clara and Leroy's eyes, they were surrounded by terrifying Sacred Power Arrows with no escape route.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were very tense but not afraid because they knew Osborne would never harm them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thousands of arrows ultimately landed within a three-mile radius around Clara and Leroy, piercing into the desert rapidly before exploding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the three-mile radius of the desert seemed as if it had been intensely bombarded. Except for the spot where Clara and Leroy stood, arrows fell everywhere else, densely packed without a single gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next second, black blood seeped from the desert, staining it entirely black.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was the blood and sap of the Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, many Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivies perished under Osborne's Solar Sacred Arrow's first move, Meteor Arrow Tempest. Within a three-mile radius around Clara and Leroy, all Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivies hidden in the desert were locked onto and killed by Osborne's arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, staring at the blackened desert, smelling the stench of blood, and watching the not-yet-dead Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivies twist and crawl out from the desert before writhing a few times and dying, Clara and Leroy were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's arrow had killed at least a thousand Abyssal Snakes and hundreds of Bloody Ivies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His power is terrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having spent time searching for Bloody Ivy in the desert, Clara and Leroy were well aware of the strength of Bloody Ivy and Abyssal Snake. Though not very powerful, they were difficult to deal with. They had to use both Sacred Power and Sacred Artifacts to pierce the snake skin of Abyssal Snake or cut through Bloody Ivy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne killed a whole group with just one arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy swallowed hard, exchanged a glance, and then looked toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was sitting on Flash's back. They were still far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Flash appeared in front of Clara and Leroy, as if teleporting, moving so fast it startled them both.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne!" Clara and Leroy said simultaneously with some surprise, "You saved us again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "As long as you're okay, that's all that matters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne looked at Clara and frowned, "You were bitten by the Abyssal Snake? You can't move?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy quickly said, "Clara was bitten by the Abyssal Snake accidentally while trying to save me. Luckily, you arrived in time. Otherwise, we might have already..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Leroy's eyes were still filled with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand. "This matter is over. From now on, just follow me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne placed his hand on Clara's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he activated the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity</span><span> </span><span>and quickly purged</span><span> the toxins from Clara's body. Soon, Clara's pale face regained its color, and she was able to move again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara exclaimed in surprise, "Osborne, you can detoxify?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "I know a bit. Besides, the Abyssal Snake's toxin isn't strong. It's not fatal, it just prevents you from using Sacred Power for a while and makes your body feel weak. So, detoxifying it isn't hard. If it were a deadly toxin, it wouldn't be this easy for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara widened her eyes, thinking, "The Abyssal Snake's toxin isn't strong? How is that possible? Many contestants prepared antidotes, including Sacred Elixirs. However, after being bitten by the Abyssal Snake, none of the antidotes worked."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, the contestants wouldn't have been so terrified and frantically fleeing. Yet, Osborne said the Abyssal Snake's toxin isn't strong. He even detoxified it effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Osborne didn't use any antidote at all, just a special energy that flowed through my body. Then, the poison was quickly neutralized. And my body has already returned to its peak condition. This is incredible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance, both feeling that Osborne was becoming more and more mysterious, like a true abyss, with no clue what other abilities he might have.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they tactfully chose not to question him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they all looked at Flash beneath Osborne. Staring at the blood-red warhorse with three pairs of wings, their eyes were filled with curiosity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speed Osborne displayed earlier was simply too fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And clearly, it was all thanks to this blood-red warhorse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy looked closely, then revealed shocked expressions. "Empyrean Sacredness! This is a warhorse at the level of Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Let me introduce you. Its name is Flash, my newly acquired pet beast. Flash, they are my friends."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Flash glanced at Clara and Leroy arrogantly, nodding slightly as if greeting them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy widened their eyes. Clara thought, "Is this the pet beast Osborne just got? And it's a pet beast at the level of Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy thought, "Osborne is just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. Yet he managed to tame a pet beast at the level of Empyrean Sacredness. Its name is Flash? Judging by its speed, the name truly suits it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they couldn't figure out how Osborne managed to do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A beast at the level of Empyrean Sacredness is extremely proud. How could it willingly become a pet beast and mount for an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy couldn't figure it out, but they still didn't ask. Feeling the battle waves behind getting closer, Clara anxiously said, "Osborne, we need to leave here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Magma Devourer is approaching. The judges can't stop it at all. If the Magma Devourer catches up to us, we're doomed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We need to leave here quickly and catch up with the team ahead. Right now, all the native creatures on Abyssal Planet have started a riot. Our only hope of survival is to stick together."</span></p><div class="pagination">
