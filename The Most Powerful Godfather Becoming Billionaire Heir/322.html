        <h1>Chapter 322 Breaking News</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos originally wanted to gather his father's men to teach Alexander a harsh lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, he was surrounded by hordes of reporters and fans, creating utter chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Marcos finally regrouped with the dozens of burly men, Alexander's </span><span>group was long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! They actually got away! You're all useless... just a bunch of useless idiots..." Marcos roared in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find them! I will have my revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporters hadn't gotten much from Marcos, but with their keen instincts, they quickly gathered firsthand accounts from other passengers on the flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, major entertainment news outlets and viral video platforms were all filled with stories about Marcos harassing a woman on a flight and getting a serious beating from her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was so furious he nearly vomited blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, look at this! These reporters are terrible! How am I supposed to face anyone after this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the guy who hit me is even worse. I have to find him and make him pay for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him, a well-preserved, elegant woman embraced him, comforting him repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, my son. Your father will definitely help you get revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you have to find that bastard who hit me; otherwise, how will I ever show my face again?" Marcos pleaded to his father, Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was tall and burly, with a square face and piercing eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You call yourself my son? You've brought nothing but shame to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elegant woman wasn't pleased, scolding him. "Why are you getting mad at your son? He's the victim here; it's not his fault he was attacked. You'd better find that culprit within three days, or you'll answer to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed and scolded Caleb as he grew increasingly annoyed but could do nothing about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! That's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb slammed his hand on the table, finally silencing the furious woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You keep spoiling this waste of a son. One day, the two of you are going to bury me. I'll send someone to investigate, but if this doesn't end well, I won't be able to hold my head up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, both of you had better keep quiet for now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb's eyes flashed with anger, and he stormed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was overjoyed; his dad was one of the most powerful figures in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>. He was sure they'd soon find that bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the time came, he'd kill the man and have fun with the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos sneered with anticipation, barely able to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Marriott Hotel...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Price, welcome, welcome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman stood at the door to greet Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly said, "Thank you, Ms. Foster. This is Mr. Alexander Hawthorne, one of our firm's VIP clients."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Avery Foster showed no warmth towards Alexander and said coldly, "Mr. </span><span>Hawthorne, I heard you hit Marcos on the plane? Maybe it felt good for you, but this could bring a disastrous setback to our firm's work in Tijuana."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just Marcos? That's nothing. If any issues arise that you can't handle, I'll help out for Madelyn's sake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn felt a sweet warmth in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just bragging," Avery scoffed and ignored Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't care to interact with this inexplicable woman. After settling in, Madelyn immediately contacted her cousin, Roman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the call, she had a delighted smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Foster, good news! My cousin has arranged a meeting with Mr. Dukes from Tijuana Bank in a private room at the restaurant this afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not bad, as long as it solves the issue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander arranged for Walter to coordinate with Quentin and set a time to meet Quentin's grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madelyn, I looked into it just now. If you want Tijuana Bank to unfreeze the funds, it's unlikely that just a director would have the authority. You'd need Tijuana's President, Mr. Dawson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery gave him a harsh glare and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're smarter than us, don't you? Do you really believe we're unaware of what you've figured out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Myers isn't someone you can just meet on a whim. No one asked for your opinion, and aside from causing trouble, what else are you capable of?"</span></p></div>
