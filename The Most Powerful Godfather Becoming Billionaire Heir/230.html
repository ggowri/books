        <h1>Chapter 230 Recommended</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his whole body was extremely heavy as if it was filled with cement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after slightly using the Force, his mind immediately became extremely clear and his body quickly recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert was a very good hypnotist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had never suffered such a strange attack before and was almost defeated by the opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Rober could only make Alexander feel dizzy, which was the limit of Robert's ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could hypnotize a Warrior, that would be incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beads of sweat were already oozing out of Robert's forehead. He knew that if he failed, he would suffer severe backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander launched a counterattack, the Force flowed to his eyes, and a strange light flashed in his pupils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's eyes suddenly went dark and he felt an excruciating pain in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Puff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat out a large mouthful of blood and staggered back several steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, this is a misunderstanding..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert quickly explained, his eyes full of shock and horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I had no ill intentions. I just wanted to assess your strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert explained in a panic that if his hypnosis ability was cracked and counterattacked by the other party, he would become a lamb to be slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Milton? What on earth do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very unhappy that Robert hypnotized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't resist the other party's hypnosis, all his secrets would be revealed, and he might even be controlled by the other party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Milton! I am a member of the Brilliant Group and a top client of the trading center. Why are you being rude to me? What is your intention?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued to question angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with murderous intent. He looked like he was ready to attack at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, please don't misunderstand me! This is my fault. I didn't explain it clearly. Everything is my fault..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's face turned pale and he hurried to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you have passed the test of strength. I wonder if you are interested in working at Treasure Island?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can recommend you as the security chief of the trading center!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a moment of silence in the hall. Lynne was so surprised that she couldn't speak. She covered her mouth with her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? You want to recommend me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was delighted, it was a good opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security chief of the trading center did not hold a high position but had real power. With this identity, he could find Guzman's hiding place as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not agree immediately, but asked, "What will be my salary?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Robert heard him ask this, he finally believed Alexander's identity completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If an undercover agent wanted to sneak in and cause trouble, he would agree without hesitation to such a good opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert was happy in his heart. If he could recruit a strong man, it would be a credit to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Supervisory level employees can enjoy high salaries and benefits, purchase any product at a 10% discount, and can also use the internal intelligence system."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And a strong man like you will definitely be able to reach a higher level in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert enthusiastically introduced the salary, and then asked expectantly, "Mr. Hawthorne, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pretended to hesitate for a while before nodding and agreeing, "Okay, I can try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, before officially taking office, the general manager of our trading center has a small assessment. I hope you don't mind..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Robert spoke, he observed Alexander's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander didn't say anything, Robert was very embarrassed. He was afraid that Alexander would be angry, so he explained again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Hawthorne. With your ability, you are more than qualified to be the security director. The assessment is just a formality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted lightly, and the atmosphere suddenly became more tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bone-chilling chill emerged, permeating and sweeping across the entire room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert felt as if an iceberg was pressing down on him. His legs trembled uncontrollably and his whole body felt cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very afraid that Alexander would get angry and attack, which would be a big trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, since it's just a formality, I'll go with you to meet the general manager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded indifferently, looking dominated.</span></p></div>
