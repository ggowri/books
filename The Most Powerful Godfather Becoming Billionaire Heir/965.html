        <h1>Chapter 965 Gamble</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you seen Alexander's personal profile?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver answered honestly, "I've seen it before. I've seen it many times before, but I never understood how he became so successful. If he was so capable, why did he marry Jane and spend her money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin frowned and thought it was really strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was like a meteor falling from the sky and suddenly became successful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for his identity as the Godfather's illegitimate son, it did not mean that Alexander relied on the gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the wealthy and powerful people in Loscity were able to be conquered by Alexander not only because of his power, but also because of the profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The magic powder and beauty ointments could bring huge benefits to everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Neither of them spoke, each thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, Gavin said, "He must be hiding something. Many of us in the Ghost agree on this. Therefore, some people are targeting him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver didn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was so frightened to hear the Ghost that he trembled and dared not say a word. He had to protect himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Go back. Don't get involved in what happens the day after tomorrow. This will be good for you. I will speak to Mr. Blunt and give you a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Gavin Lawson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver felt much more relieved and was secretly glad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned around to leave, then suddenly thought of something, and said carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gavin Lawson, if Grace really loves Alexander, I think it will be better for me to stand on Alexander's side..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A smile appeared on Gavin's face, and he nodded with appreciation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin said, "Very good, Oliver. You are much better now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver's back was immediately covered in cold sweat. Gavin was obviously testing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Oliver had left just now, everything would have been ruined. He would never get promoted again and might even be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin said, "I suggest you choose Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Gavin Lawson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed to take a gamble. If he won, he would be successful. If he made the wrong choice, he started all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver had gone through many hardships and obstacles to reach his current position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was getting older. If he didn't get promoted, he wouldn't have a chance in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin warned Oliver with a serious expression, "What I just told you is confidential."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gavin Lawson, don't worry. I'll keep it a secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he dared not reveal the secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Grace was coming out of the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been lying in bed until now and thinking of Alexander, making her feel dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tempting aroma, accompanied by a familiar chuckle, came from the kitchen. Someone was cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace walked over and saw her mother, Ave Lawson, wearing an apron and busy in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her mature and graceful figure, wrapped in the apron, looked more attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Grace's father, Gale Lawson, laughed and hugged Ave tightly from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't scare me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave exclaimed and almost dropped the ingredients on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale didn't care about that. He held her breasts with both hands and started rubbing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave said coquettishly, "What are you doing? Grace might see us. I still have to cook..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale said, "Gale hasn't gotten up yet, and my dad is meeting the chief of the police station. We still have time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale held Ave and pressed her against the kitchen cabinet, letting her lift her buttocks. He put his belly on her hip and rubbed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace, who was hiding nearby, suddenly blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always been a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing such an exciting scene, which was performed by her parents, Grace immediately lost her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace thought of Alexander's tall and strong body and imagined that she and Alexander had made love in the same posture.</span></p></div>
