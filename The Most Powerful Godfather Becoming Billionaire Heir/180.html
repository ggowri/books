        <h1>Chapter 180 Make the Move</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic was fuming, realizing he had underestimated Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer holding back, he unleashed his full power, launching himself like a speeding bullet straight at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a punch that seemed to tear through the air, his fist emitted a thunderous crack</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's my turn!" Alexander shouted, retaliating with a punch of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two fists collided with a thunderous impact, like a meteor striking a planet, unleashing an invisible shockwave that rippled outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic was sent flying back, crashing to the ground like a rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually broke my arm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with anger and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>also</span><span> took a slight step back, astonished by this old man's unexpected strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time since becoming a Warrior that he had been forced back, </span><span>proving</span><span> that Dominic was no slouch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary stood frozen</span><span>. He widened his</span><span> eyes wide in disbelief. Dominic, a top-tier fighter from the Federer family, had been effortlessly defeated by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive smirk, Alexander scoffed. "Is that all you've got? You might as well leave now while you still can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mocking tone stung, leaving Gary humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swallowing his pride, he gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait. You'll regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group, once threatening, now retreated like whipped dogs</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were gone, Alexander and Ava strolled into the villa, </span><span>chatting and laughing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, an undeniable warmth began to bloom between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had previously mentioned that once her period was over, they'd finally be able to </span><span>do it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, she said, "I... I'm going to take a shower now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's excitement surged at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava found his adorable reactions endearing, leaning closer to whisper in his ear with a playful tone, "Sweetheart, you'd better wash up too and be a good boy, waiting for me on the bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Alexander's arousal was undeniable; a little tent sprang up in his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stifled a giggle, playfully pinching his dick before swaying her hips and entering the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the sound of water filled the air, the gentle trickle echoing in the bathroom. Through the glass door, a silhouette of her form emerged, further igniting Alexander's desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he pushed the door open and stepped inside, eager to join her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava jumped in surprise, quickly covering her chest with both hands. However, her ample bosom was too </span><span>big</span><span> to conceal, and the attempt only made it more tantalizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So beautiful," Alexander murmured to himself, entranced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smooth skin, perfect hourglass figure, ample bosom, and shapely legs exuded an irresistible allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava giggled at his stunned expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I really look that good? No wonder you were in such a rush. Did I steal your breath away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved confidently towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her naked form was right in front of Alexander, her intoxicating scent filling his senses, and Alexander felt his restraint slipping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava teased him, "You haven't even bathed yet. No funny business&mdash;but I can make the moves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned close, her fingers tracing tantalizing lines over his body, a mischievous </span><span>smile appearing on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a naughty boy, just like all those other men. What are you planning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, Alexander pulled her into his embrace. "I want to join you in the bath. Come on, be a good girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathtub was spacious, large enough for several people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ava knelt to turn on the faucet and fill the tub with hot water, her movements revealed her stunning form, driving Alexander's excitement to the boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the water was ready, Ava guided Alexander into the bath, making him comfortable before settling herself in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kissed passionately, their exploration deepening with each embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze lingered on her voluptuous breasts, and Ava, sensing his desire, pressed them against him willingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So big and soft... just perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava teased, "All men like big ones, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I know I do." Alexander grinned, unable to hold back any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gasped, "No, we haven't bathed yet. That part's... dirty..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll clean up later," he said with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aah! You're such a rascal!" Ava exclaimed, her body suddenly tensing in surprise.</span></p></div>
