        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been carefully exerting his Force Control, subtly influencing Nancy's consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with the influence of the magic powder in the wine, Nancy couldn't control her heart with desire in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said solemnly, "I only want the Kaylon Pill, so I don't have to touch you. No matter what means you use, you can take your blood, or with other men..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me the Kaylon Pill, and I will help you get rid of this marriage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy rolled her eyes at him and let out a meaningful giggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was good at acting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was good-looking and had a special temperament that no one else had, which was hard to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time in her life, Nancy found a man attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of the Force and magic powder, Nancy could no longer control her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe being with this man, she could cancel her marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No man in the world could tolerate his fianc&eacute;e being with another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not knowing when, the bar was cleared and closed, even the security guards and waiters left, it was obvious that Brittany was in charge of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two cheered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's cheeks flushed, her heartbeat quickened, her eyes emanated a message of desire, and she couldn't control herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want the Kaylon Pill, and the Kaylon Pill requires my blood from my first sex with a man, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and licked his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy came closer and her charming body fragrance filled his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do me a favor and I'll help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Alexander agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My shoulders are a bit sore lately, can you give me a massage..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy spoke in a delicate tone and moved to sit next to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but put her hands on her chest, and with a gentle touch, an electric shock-like feeling immediately swept through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but widen his eyes, attracted by Nancy's coquettish behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you promise to give me a massage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's tone was delicate, and it was obvious that she was extremely horny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her with a complicated expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Nancy was no worse than Ava and Brittany. She even looked like a combination of Ava and Lynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy took Alexander's hand on her chest, and said in a coquettish voice, "You invented the beauty cream, didn't you? It's amazing. After I applied it, I felt my breasts swell up and grow a size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about you help me strengthen the effect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Alexander to answer, she took the initiative to lie down on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out the ointment, put his hand directly into Nancy's camisole, and started massaging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy didn't wear a bra underneath her camisole, and her plump breasts were swinging under her clothes, looking very tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was like a great pianist, playing world-famous music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dexterous fingers slid over her breasts, caressing and kneading, lingering on her nipples to tease. Nancy couldn't help but let out a moan, shivering with excitement as if she was electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, how come you are so good at touching? Do you often give women massages?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy blushed and said, "I have no right to be jealous, I just feel that being touched by you is much more comfortable than me touching myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a woman felt more comfortable touching herself than touched by a man, then what </span><span>was the role of men?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Nancy, who had a coquettish look on her face and pressed her legs together, and his heart was burning with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, if the Kaylon Pill can save my daughter, I will share the formula of the potion and beauty ointment with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made a solemn promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's a lot of money. Are you willing to give me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While enjoying the massage, Nancy reached out her hand to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned forward and whispered, "Money is nothing. If I can get a woman like you, any amount of money is worth it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hot air he exhaled sprayed on her plump breasts, and Nancy couldn't help but let out moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you have a girlfriend and Brittany. Do you want me to be your mistress? You are such a pervert!"</span></p></div>
