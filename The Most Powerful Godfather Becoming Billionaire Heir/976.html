        <h1>Chapter 976 Giving Gifts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher smirked at the comments around him, displaying a mix of contempt and smugness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, I was looking for you!" he exclaimed, approaching Grace with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his surprise, Grace coldly snorted and dashed towards the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander entered, Grace quickly returned to him, like a bird to its nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, Grace, and Madelyn chatted and laughed together, completely ignoring Asher as if he were invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had come to Loscity not only to handle his grandfather's grave but also to win Grace's affection, believing it would elevate the Vance family's status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To assert his claim, he had publicly announced that he was Grace's fianc&eacute;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, in front of everyone, Grace was dismissing him and enjoying herself with another man, which felt like a public humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was intolerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether in Kingsdon of Eagle Empire or Avalora, Asher was a person of significance, accustomed to respect from high-ranking officials and tycoons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Determined to take action, he called out, "Grace, look! I've prepared a birthday gift for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a wave, several subordinates approached, carrying exquisite gift boxes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, these are masterpieces from world-renowned jewelers, necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets. These are all for you," he declared, opening the boxes to reveal dazzling jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was affluent and had a keen appreciation for jewelry, which was valued at least in the tens of millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was just an ordinary birthday, Asher's ability to give such extravagant gifts highlights his remarkable financial strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their surprising and envious expressions pleased him greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Step aside! Can't you see I'm giving Grace a birthday gift?" he snapped, casting a disdainful look at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced at the jewelry and shook his head dismissively. "What a waste of money! It's not useful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher gasped, his face turning pale before he burst into laughter. "You can't afford these, right? A man can be poor but shouldn't speak nonsense. What gives you the right to stand next to my fianc&eacute;e?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!" Asher shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, there was dead silence at the scene. It was obvious that Asher didn't know Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, many in attendance knew Alexander was a top figure in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Asher insulted Alexander in public, and Alexander was vindictive and ruthless. Everyone felt that something big was going to happen today and became uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave stepped forward, pointing at the small gift box Alexander had given. "You're so stingy. Look at your gift compared to Asher's. It's worlds apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, remember, if a man doesn't like a woman, he won't spend money on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha!" Alexander laughed lightly. "How do you know my gift isn't valuable enough? That seems a bit presumptuous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His casual remark made Ave uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Alexander, you're talking nonsense! Asher's jewelry is far more valuable than what's in that little box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're being ridiculous. What a shameless man! I can't even take you seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing who Alexander was, Asher sneered, "So you're Alexander, the developer of magic powder. Don't worry, you won't be so smug for long. Even your magic powder belongs to our Lawson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, to impress you, I'll reveal the grand final gift I prepared for Grace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A final gift? What could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It must be more valuable than those jewels. That's incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was talking about it and became excited.</span></p></div>
