        <h1>Chapter 956 Digging the Grave</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged, burly man in a cemetery worker's uniform waddled up, surrounded by a few others, all armed with shovels and tools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were full of menace, clearly not here with good intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here?" the fat man, Ryder Maddox, barked. "Get lost! This plot's been taken!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you hear? Mr. Maddox ordered you to leave. This land's been requisitioned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move it. Stop standing around!" They ordered, giving Ava a lingering, not-so-friendly look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes widened, and she instinctively grabbed Ryder's arm. "What do you mean? This is our family's grave! You can't just take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder scoffed, pushing her aside with a smug grin. "Oh, really? This land's been chosen by Sir Vance. Now get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily didn't budge, her face a mix of anger and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could say another word, Alexander stepped forward and slapped Ryder across the face, sending him sprawling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze was icy as he glared at Ryder. His eyes burned with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare touch me?" Ryder screamed, clutching his swollen cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped onto Ryder's face, pressing down hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder yelped in pain, squirming helplessly as he was pinned to the ground, like a fish gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lackeys froze, too stunned to move. They were used to intimidation, but this was different. They had never seen anyone so ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily gasped, rushing forward to pull Alexander back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Don't be reckless! If they call the cops, this'll blow up. Just let them go as long as they don't touch the grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder staggered to his feet, his face now a swollen mess. "You think hitting me is enough? No way!" he </span><span>spat,</span><span> his words laced with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half of his face was a bruise, with a boot print clearly visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, let's teach him a lesson!" he growled to his crew. "I'll take the heat for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his signal, the men raised their shovels, circling Alexander, ready to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry! It's my fault. We'll pay you for the trouble. Just don't touch the grave, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder spat at her feet, sneering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry doesn't cut it. You think you can buy me off? Sir Vance's paying two million dollars for this land, and I'm digging up this grave today, no matter what."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Alexander's mother's tombstone with a derisive grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smash it! What are you waiting for? Get rid of them, dig up the grave! If anything happens, I'll take the fall. Sir Vance will back me up!" he barked at his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men around Alexander suddenly charged forward, like they'd been injected with adrenaline, swinging their shovels and preparing to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who touches that grave is dead!" Alexander growled, his voice ice-cold and filled with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Ryder, what the hell do you think you're doing?" A loud, angry shout cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly man rushed </span><span>over,</span><span> his face red with exertion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he saw him, the expression on Ryder and his crew changed. They immediately dropped their shovels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The newcomer was Lennox Wilder, the cemetery manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stormed up to them, fury written all over his face. "Ryder! What is this nonsense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder rolled his eyes, scoffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lennox, don't think I'm scared of you. Sir Vance wants this plot, and he's paying two million dollars for it. I'm here to dig up the grave, and nothing's </span><span>gonna</span><span> stop me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lennox's eyes widened in disbelief. "What? You're out of your mind! This is illegal! I'm not letting you do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shouting now, his anger rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all going along with this? Digging up a grave for money? Are you all really okay with that? Don't you have any shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men around Ryder lowered their heads, suddenly looking small and uncomfortable. The bravado drained from them as they realized just how messed up the situation was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder, still nursing his swollen face, let out a mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lennox, don't be naive. Sir Vance wants to be buried here, in his hometown. This plot is his. End of the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you really think you can stand in the way of the Vance family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're one of the most powerful families in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, with generals and </span><span>high-ranking officials on their side. You? You're nothing."</span></p></div>
