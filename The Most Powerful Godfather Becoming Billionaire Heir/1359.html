        <h1>Chapter 1359 A Big Deal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the table beside him lay a silver sword, its scabbard intricately engraved with the word "Dragon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he wore a stern expression as he fixed his gaze on Dexter, who was trembling in the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter wiped the sweat from his brow, feeling the weight of his brother's formidable sword energy. He tried to steady himself and stammered, "Rhodes, Alexander is taking advantage of his status as a disciple from the outer courtyard of Dominion Church to bully me. With all the commotion they've caused, the vendors are now waiting to see if you'll continue paying the fees. I'm worried that your matter will be delayed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes Monroe snorted in disdain. "Alexander? How arrogant! I'll deal with him in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living room was thick with oppressive sword intent, making Dexter feel as though he might collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes was a martial arts prodigy from the outer courtyard of Dominion Church, having reached the rank of level-four warrior before turning 30, and he ranked among the top 100 on the martial arts moral list. He was the most likely candidate from the outer courtyard to become a fifth-level warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a servant entered the hall and announced, "Mr. Rhodes Monroe, Julius Wetherall wishes to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show him in," Rhodes replied coolly, clearly unconcerned about the Marshal of the Darwin Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius entered, visibly pale and fanning himself with a folding fan. He couldn't help but shiver at the chill in the hall. When he looked up, his anger flared as he saw Rhodes casually sipping coffee, seemingly oblivious to his presence. When had he ever been treated this way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius took a seat in the chair to Rhodes's left, his expression stern and silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His henchman, sensing the tension, quickly stepped forward and greeted Rhodes and Dexter with a smile, "Hello, Rhodes, Dexter. I'm your cousin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes's demeanor softened slightly at the sight of Julius's follower, and the atmosphere in the room became less hostile. He spoke slowly, "What brings you here today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wetherall has come to discuss a big deal with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What kind of deal?" Rhodes replied, shaking his head with skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wetherall is prepared to offer a million gold coins in exchange for your assistance in eliminating someone during the outer courtyard competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity piqued, Rhodes asked, "And who would that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius interjected eagerly, "Alexander from the outer courtyard of Dominion Church!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you! Who do you think you are? Do you really believe you can just eliminate the disciples of Dominion Church at will? Do you know who I am?" Rhodes suddenly shouted, his voice echoing in the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius's face flushed with rage as he leaped up and shouted back, "You're so arrogant! My father is the Grand Marshal of the Army and a level-five warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes didn't even glance at Julius, dismissively stating, "A level-five warrior? Soon, I'll be one too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Julius snapped his folding fan shut, about to storm out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his expression shifted, and a sly smile crept across his face. "Excellent! I heard you're a level-four warrior? A million gold coins isn't enough. How about I throw in a first-class farm in the south of the city?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes's expression changed; he urgently needed funds. Both the Manual House and the Treasure Library required substantial investments, and he needed resources to build his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, why would Dexter be collecting protection fees? A farm spanning over three miles was considered a prime asset, not something easily acquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Rhodes's silence, Julius smirked, pulled out a stack of bills and a deed from his pocket, placed them on the table, and turned to leave with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They took my money, so they better deliver. Let these two fools battle it out; I have plenty of cash!" Julius laughed as he exited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander had been seeking help from various sources, hoping to secure a decent house or manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in Darwin, the capital, not only were properties expensive, but finding satisfactory land proved challenging. Therefore, he had temporarily housed Vegeta, Nova, and over a hundred tribesmen at the Moon Inn. Fortunately, Alexander had enough funds to cover their hotel stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Hrodvik New Year approaching in two months, a significant competition in the outer courtyard loomed, where students would be grouped based on their gold, silver, and bronze medals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a tad disheartened, Alexander noted that as a silver medalist, he would likely be placed at the bottom of the rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Consequently, he dedicated himself to practicing martial arts with even more determination, striving to reach the rank of level-four warrior, but progress remained elusive. It seemed that achieving level-four warrior status wasn't something that could be attained through mere desire. Nonetheless, he felt that his golden body had made notable advancements.</span></p></div>
