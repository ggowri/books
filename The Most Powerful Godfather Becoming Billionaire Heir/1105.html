        <h1>Chapter 1105 There Is Salvation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should we do? Is Dad really going to die? He coughed up so much blood just now... what do we do?" Gale mumbled in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad! What do we do? If Grandpa dies, the Lawson family won't be as powerful as before!" Howard wailed, and his face was contorted with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even he knew, despite his foolishness, that if Gavin died, the Lawson family would fall from grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside, the sound of hurried footsteps and anguished cries echoed as more members of the Lawson family arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was pacing nervously around the yard, their faces etched with worry, like they were on edge, not knowing what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale took a deep breath to steady himself. Howard's cries were only making things worse, adding fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up!" he barked, his voice harsh, and Howard instantly fell silent, startled by the fury in Gale's tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the doctors, caught off guard, looked up at Gale, but quickly returned to their frantic work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander noticed an older man, his hair graying, drenched in sweat. He was guiding the other doctors in their desperate attempts to save Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strain on his face was evident, as if he were carrying a heavy burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dr. Matt, how is my father doing?" Gale asked, his voice grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matt wiped his forehead, clearly at a loss for words. He paused for a long moment before speaking, as though trying to find the right words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Gale Lawson, Gavin has suffered a stroke. The clot is located in the brainstem... It's a very complex area, and I'm afraid the damage may be irreversible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if Gavin survives this, he may never recover... He could be left paralyzed, helpless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Matt's words sank in, the entire Lawson family's faces drained of color. Was this the end of the Lawson family's fortune?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden clenched his fists, his body trembling with anger and frustration. He grabbed Matt by the arm, demanding, "Aren't you a Bell Medical Award recipient? Aren't you a world-renowned expert?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I command you&mdash;no matter the cost, no matter what methods you must use&mdash;save my father! If he dies, I will hold you responsible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matt's brow furrowed deeply, and regret washed over him. If he had known things would escalate like this, he would never have been swayed by the millions of dollars in diagnostic fees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Gavin let out a tortured scream, followed by another violent cough, spewing blood all over the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he went limp, as if all the life had drained from him. His face turned an ominous shade of black, and there was no sign of life left in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heart monitor emitted a steady, unyielding beep&mdash;a flat line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dr. Matt, what do we do now?" The doctors and nurses shouted in panic. They were at their wit's end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew that Gavin wasn't just any patient&mdash;he was the pillar of the Lawson family. If they failed to save him, not only would their careers be over, but the family could face ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prepare to inject adrenaline, get the defibrillator ready!" Dr. Matt ordered, his hands trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sweat dripped from his face, staining the floor beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the adrenaline injected and the defibrillator in place, Gavin's body convulsed violently. Then, a weak heartbeat returned, flickering like a dying ember.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, there's still hope! We can still save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"His heart is beating! Keep going!" The doctors cheered, relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as everyone exhaled in relief, Gavin's head jerked to the side, his body going limp once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heart monitor shrieked again, the weak pulse vanishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Matt's heart sank. He felt as though the ground had been ripped from beneath him. He almost fainted from the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Lawson family members staggered back, their faces pale, their legs weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Gavin died, not only would the Lawson family fall from grace, but the repercussions would send shockwaves throughout the entire power structure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the room fell into a heavy silence, hope all but gone, a calm but authoritative voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. Gavin won't die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone turned in shock and confusion, staring at Alexander. What was he saying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Matt's temper flared, and he pointed an accusing finger at Alexander. "Who are you? This is no time for jokes! Are you mocking us? What are you trying to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander ignored him. Without a word, he walked up to the bedside, placed his hand firmly over Gavin's heart, and channeled his Force directly into him.</span></p></div>
