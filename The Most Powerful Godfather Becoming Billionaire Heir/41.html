        <h1>Chapter 41 Submission</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William coughed violently, spitting out a mouthful of blood. His voice was weak as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, even if I tell you, you'll still kill me. There's no way you'd let me live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I may be just a hitman, but even hitmen have principles. Just kill me and be done with it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gave a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Actually, I think you've got potential. Perhaps I could let you live after all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William trembled, his eyes widening in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... you'd let me live? I don't buy it. You're just trying to trick me into betraying my employer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked down at him, his deep eyes glinting with an enigmatic light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even an ant clings to life. Are you truly unafraid of death?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He continued, his voice smooth and persuasive. "You've got skills. It'd be a shame to waste them. I can heal your wounds and take you on as one of my men. All I ask in return is the name of your employer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't believe it! Are you... are you messing with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William felt dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's gaze terrified him. Despite appearing so calm and collected, William felt a chill down his spine, beads of sweat breaking out on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William, a battle-hardened veteran who'd seen his fair share of bloodshed, found himself unable to meet Alexander's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I always keep my word, provided you obey me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's voice dripped with persuasion as he channeled The Force into his eyes, fixing William with an intense stare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a technique from Ultimate Legacy called "Force Control", working on principles similar to deep hypnosis but far more potent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By manipulating The Force, he could influence his opponent's mind and will, embedding a portion of The Force in the target's psyche to exert long-term control and ultimately subdue them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's eyes glowed with a faint purple hue, captivating and otherworldly. The Force flowed through him, lending an eerie power to his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stared at Alexander, dumbstruck. Already severely wounded, his resolve crumbled under the threat of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, with Alexander using the Force to influence him, William's mind grew even hazier, his thoughts turning to mush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's excitement grew at this. There was hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you start obeying me right now, I'll not only spare your life, but I'll make you my subordinate. From then on, no one will ever be able to harm you again..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's persuasive words, amplified by the Force, resonated through William's neural pathways at a specific frequency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's body swayed unsteadily, his gaze growing vacant, eyelids heavy with fatigue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was drenched in sweat, utterly exhausted from the effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a top-tier assassin, William had spilled blood and taken lives, his will unyielding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If not for his severe injuries, Alexander wouldn't have entertained the notion of controlling him with the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his current Novice Warrior abilities, even if he used up all his Force, he couldn't possibly control the mind of a top-tier assassin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... you really want me to be your subordinate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's expression was full of hesitation, clearly engaged in an intense internal struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander slammed his palm against William's forehead, channeling the last surge of The Force into William's skull.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sharp crack echoed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's eyes bulged, something inside his mind shattering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes rolled back, and he passed out cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gasped for air, unable to hide his excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Judging by William's reaction, it seemed the process had worked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gaining control over such a formidable assassin made all his efforts worthwhile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After The Force controlled William's mind, he became highly loyal. Only Alexander's death or intervention by a more powerful Warrior could break The Force's grip on William's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander meditated briefly, regaining some of his Force energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then used The Force to begin healing William. He'd expended considerable effort and couldn't let the guy die now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's injuries were indeed severe. Alexander had to meditate several times before he could barely keep William's condition from worsening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The once bloody wounds had stopped bleeding. Even the places where bones were shattered began to knit together under The Force's influence, though full recovery would take time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, William slowly opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at Alexander with a dazed expression, his eyes full of confusion and bewilderment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said coldly, "William, I saved your life. Now call me Boss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William shook his head hard, unable to remember what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He only felt that Alexander was incredibly kind and powerful, making him want to trust and submit instinctively.</p></div>
