        <h1>Chapter 28 The Ball</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander returned to immerse himself in meditation to enhance the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the hours ticked by, the evening dance drew nearer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The entire upper echelon of Loscity buzzed with excitement, each member preparing to attend the ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">First, everyone was eager to witness if Ryan would indeed become the vice president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Second, they all sought an opportunity to meet and ingratiate the enigmatic new chairman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's phone alarm sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at the time, noting the ball would commence in an hour, and he immediately felt a surge of energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He showered, donned the attire Ava had chosen for him, and prepared to depart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne had the car ready and kept waiting outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Alexander was settled, Anne promptly handed him an exquisite wooden box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, this is a custom-made mask for you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander opened the box to reveal an intricate silver mask. Its surface was smooth and emanated a soft glow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He placed it on, instantly exuding an air of mystery that left Anne in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go!" Alexander commanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne's car raced towards the Saint Tower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Saint Group occupied the top floor of the 108-story Saint Tower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As evening descended, the parking lot teemed with luxury vehicles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Men and women in dazzling attire formed a long queue at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Security for the ball was tight; no one without an invitation was granted entry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, I'll go in alone," Alexander declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stowing the mask away, he exited the car and approached the building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava stood by the steps, resplendent in her finest attire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her beautiful face and alluring figure, accentuated by her evening gown, radiated an aura of nobility and elegance akin to a goddess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was momentarily spellbound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not our first meeting. Why the astonishment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava blushed, playfully rolling her eyes at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile graced Alexander's face. "Sorry, I'm a bit late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava admired his suit, clearly pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You look quite dashing. You should dress up more often and not always so casually," she remarked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I am honored to be your dance partner tonight," Alexander said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He extended his arm with gentlemanly grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled, taking his arm, and together they walked towards the Saint Tower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With their striking appearances, they drew the eyes of countless admirers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those familiar with Ava were shocked, speculating about Alexander's identity and assuming he must be the scion of a prominent family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, with Ava's status as the president of the Saint Group and her aloof nature, she would never show interest in an ordinary man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faced with the curious and eager gazes of the crowd, Ava remained aloof, distancing herself from the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Alexander's first time attending such a grand ball. His first time under the scrutiny of so many complex stares made him feel a twinge of nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. Just relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From today on, everyone here will vie for your favor; you're at the pinnacle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava whispered reassuringly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but chuckle. "So, am I officially a loverboy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Judging by your current appearance, it's too soon for you to think of living off women!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava playfully pinched his waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once they entered the venue, Ava offered Alexander a few words of advice before seeking out Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To this moment, Ava remained unaware if the new chairman would grace the ball with his presence, a fact that irked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander spotted Ryan, seated in a wheelchair, being pushed in arrogantly by Jane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite his inability to walk, Ryan was impeccably dressed and carried an air of pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander looked their way, they also noticed him. They looked shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing here? Who let you in?" Ryan demanded, his voice laced with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had yet to seek revenge for his broken legs, and here was Alexander, brazenly appearing before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Security! Security! You must have sneaked in. You definitely don't have an invitation. How did this happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane called out imperiously as if she were the hostess of the ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered in response, "If even you two can gain entry, why wouldn't I be allowed?"</p></div>
