        <h1>Chapter 1228 Late Night Spaghetti</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could've let us know you were back," Lynn said softly. "Here, I figured you might be hungry, so I whipped up some spaghetti. Nothing fancy, but it'll hit the spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed the plate into his hands with that motherly insistence that made any resistance futile. Looking at her caring expression, Alexander felt the tension melt from his shoulders. He set the plate down and opened his arms for a hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, stop that and eat your food. I should be getting back to bed," Lynn pretended to scold him, but instead of leaving, she shooed him toward his desk chair, making sure he actually sat down to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>This smells</span><span> amazing," Alexander said between bites. "Tastes even better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn stood behind Alexander's chair and gently massaged his neck and shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her touch filled him with warmth as he finished his spaghetti. After pushing his bowl aside, he turned and guided Lynn to sit next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?" Alexander smiled softly, caressing Lynn's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's cheeks flushed pink as she settled closer. She felt a bit lightheaded from his nearness and rested her head against his shoulder, her arms finding their way around his neck. Her breathing quickened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You smell wonderful. I really like how you smell." Alexander grinned, slipping his hand into her dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already noticed that there was nothing inside Lynn's dress, and her breasts were fascinating, too large for one hand to manage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't stop squeezing her breasts, feeling how soft they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Lynn melted further into his embrace, her mind going pleasantly hazy from his tender affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sank deeper into Alexander's embrace, her thoughts growing deliciously fuzzy from his gentle touch. Every caress sent sparks of electricity through her body, making it hard to think straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss me?" Alexander teased, his hands wandering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like crazy. Though I bet you weren't missing me at all. Ava told me you went to see Brittany. Had fun with your pretty little friend, didn't you?" Lynn's voice dripped with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but grin. Seeing Lynn all worked up like this gave him quite the ego boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took off Lynn's nightgown and moved his hands down, reaching into Lynn's pussy part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, stop that," Lynn protested weakly, her cheeks flushing pink. "Ava's right next door. What if we wake her up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made a half-hearted attempt to push him away but quickly gave up and pressed herself closer against Alexander's chest instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're always lecturing Ava about not being shy and working on her self-control," Alexander teased, trying not to laugh. "Yet here you are, getting all flustered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn felt her face burning even hotter. Right then, she would've given anything for the floor to open up and swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Alexander stood up and pinned her down on the desk, her butt puckered high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn couldn't hold back anymore, humming softly as she turned her head to look at Alexander seductively. Her expression alone was enough to drive Alexander crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the room reached its peak as Alexander shed his shirt, his masculine presence filling the space between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's heart raced as she lay there, powerless, knowing she'd have to face the </span><span>consequences of seducing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His huge cock was already staring at her</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a sight that both thrilled and intimidated Lynn, despite all her years of experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of giving her what she wanted right away, Alexander took his time, teasing her with gentle touches that drove her wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please stop teasing," Lynn whispered, her voice trembling as she blushed. "Just get on with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally </span><span>thrust</span><span> his cock in, leaving Lynn breathless and frozen in place, overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips parted as waves of pleasure washed over her, building steadily until they consumed her entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The study was filled with the soft sounds of their passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, they rested together on the sofa, Lynn nestled in Alexander's protective embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a few more days until we head to Treasure Island," Lynn said wistfully. "You need to join us there soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we're there, we can live happily as a family on the island, away from all the chaos everywhere else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a slight smile. Lynn's vision was naive, but he shared her dream. At the very least, he'd make damn sure Lynn and Ava were safe.</span></p></div>
