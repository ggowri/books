        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Ava lay trembling incessantly, motionless, clearly at her limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voluptuous, pale body was drenched in sweat, with several red marks across her ample buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Lynn could react, Alexander firmly held her head and plunged aggressively between her red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn struggled to keep up with Alexander's ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange smell hit her nose, but thinking of its origin in her daughter, Lynn felt a rush of heat and trembled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched with satisfaction as Lynn served him, his fierceness becoming more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted Lynn and pressed her onto Ava's back, stacking their pale, plump backsides together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, it was time for Alexander to show off his skills truly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room filled with the overlapping moans and cries of the two women...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't wake up from her deep sleep until the following day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Lynn lay unclothed in bed while Alexander had already gotten up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering the wild night with the three of them, Ava felt her cheeks flush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carefully slipped out of bed, quickly freshened up, and prepared to head to the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> epidemic in full swing, Ava had important matters to handle today, but she was already running late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending Alexander a quick message, she hurried toward the parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the crowded parking from last night, she had to park in the underground garage across the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't notice Bruno watching her intently from the shadows of the parking garage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno had practically melted into the environment as if he didn't exist at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava jogged a few steps, slightly out of breath, her chest heaving with the exertion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She located her car and was about to open the door when suddenly, several shadowy figures rushed out from the side, surrounding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their leader, a burly man in a ski mask, stared at her like a predator sizing up its prey, his eyes filled with menace and dark intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's stunning features and alluring figure had them drooling with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you people? What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stepped back, starting to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen that predatory look in men's eyes too many times before to mistake their intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look what we have here! What a big tits and fat ass!" the thug sneered. "Come here, pretty thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly man lunged for Ava like a tiger going for its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava slapped away his hairy hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare refuse? Let me tell you something! We've already dealt with two households here. No survivors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We poor folks are ravaged by this plague, losing so many lives, while you rich folks go on living the high life. Why should you get to stay comfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His buddies sneered in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, why should you live so well? </span><span>You</span><span> parasites got rich by exploiting us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dick, we don't often find someone this fine. We should all have our turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick Payton gave a cold laugh. Though reluctant, he didn't want to dampen their enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, you'll all get your chance. But I'm going first," Dick assured his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava could see the hungry gleam in their eyes as she frantically tried to think of an escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security at her villa was tight, with Rosalia indeed guarding Ashley's door, but Alexander could be anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off! Stay away from me! You'll regret this if I call for help!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick wasn't intimidated. Instead, he burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They waved their weapons menacingly, sneering, "We've got the numbers and the guns. Who'd dare to challenge us? Even the police have practically shut down. You're dreaming if you think anyone's coming to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold her down!" Dick commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men rushed forward, twisting Ava's arms behind her back and forcing a cloth into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmph</span><span>! He...</span><span>lp</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's muffled cries were barely audible as she struggled against their grip, but she was no match for their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dick's face twisted into a cruel smile as he reached toward Ava's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava felt sick to her stomach, overcome with despair.</span></p></div>
