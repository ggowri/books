        <h1>Chapter 1134 Boosting the Morale</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Carson&#x27;s eyes tracked a shadow rolling down the hillside, tumbling wildly before crashing to the ground.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Another one down!&quot; he shouted, a grim smile spreading across his face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The rest of the team whooped their nerves now replaced by pure adrenaline.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Prepare yourselves. We&#x27;re hitting back!&quot; he ordered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The remaining soldiers gripped their rifles, their bodies taut with readiness. They were waiting for the signal to charge.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Less than a minute passed before another gunshot split the silence, followed by a blood-curdling scream.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ah!&quot; A second shadow came rolling down the hill, crashing into the dirt below.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Carson squinted, catching a flash of fire from the trees. It was the muzzle flare from the enemy&#x27;s gun.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Gunfire erupted from the woods, the sound of bullets tearing through the night. The glow of gun flashes pierced the darkness like lightning strikes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, an earth-shaking explosion rocked the hillside. A massive fireball erupted from the trees, sending debris flying like hail in a storm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The team fell into a tense silence, the crackling flames the only sound.</p><p style="text-align:left;">William emerged from the trees, rifle in hand, his figure framed by the smoke. He waved over to Carson.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Carson, bring your team up, but stay alert!&quot; William&#x27;s voice crackled through the radio.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a surge of excitement, the men sprang into motion, climbing the slope with renewed urgency.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marvin led his squad in as well, quickly arriving at the body of one of the fallen ambushers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">William was already searching through the man&#x27;s gear.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The soldier was a beast of a man, his ID tag marked with symbols from Risun.</p><p style="text-align:left;">William&#x27;s single bullet had blown the man&#x27;s head apart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The front of his face was still recognizable, but the back was nothing but a bloody mess.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marvin quickly scanned the surroundings through his night-vision goggles, making sure no enemies were lurking. After confirming the area was clear, he moved to inspect another body.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The enemy wore high-tech combat gear. They were light, tough, and breathable, equivalent to Silver Shield Security&#x27;s finest.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And their weapons were top-of-the-line military hardware, like assault rifles, rocket launchers, and sniper rifles. Whoever had arranged this attack had a serious network behind them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marvin&#x27;s lips twisted in disgust. &quot;Sakra Society... So, it&#x27;s Yinson&#x27;s people, huh? Didn&#x27;t think that old bastard would have the guts to pull a stunt like this.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">William sneered, his face twisted with amusement, &quot;They&#x27;re making a grave mistake. Whoever they send, I&#x27;ll drop them. All of them.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marvin narrowed his eyes, a dangerous gleam in them. &quot;It&#x27;s not just Sakra Society we need to worry about. These weapons didn&#x27;t just appear out of thin air. Someone in Loscity is in bed with Yinson. That&#x27;s how they&#x27;re getting this kind of firepower.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">William chuckled, his grin icy, &quot;Then, we&#x27;ll find out who. And when we do... we&#x27;ll wipe them off the map.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The two of them gestured for their men to load the bodies into the vehicles.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Thanks for saving us, William,&quot; Carson said, offering a respectful salute.</p><p style="text-align:left;">William patted his shoulder, sighing, &quot;Don&#x27;t mention it... but it&#x27;s a damn shame we lost some good men.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Carson&#x27;s voice was tight with anger. &quot;Who the hell are they? Who wants us dead?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yeah, ambushing us like this on a highway? They&#x27;re playing with fire!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We&#x27;ll make them pay!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The whole group was boiling with rage now, ready to tear into anyone who dared oppose them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marvin&#x27;s voice rang out, cutting through the noise. &quot;Quiet!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The men immediately fell silent, the tension in the air thick enough to cut with a knife.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marvin&#x27;s eyes were hard as steel as he looked at each man. &quot;Someone wants to take down Ultimate Alliance. They don&#x27;t want us to have peace. So, are we going to let them get away with it?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;No!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Exactly! Anyone who dares cross us, we&#x27;ll take them down!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The men shouted in unison, their voices a solid wall of defiance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As elite members of Ultimate Alliance, they were no strangers to danger. Their skills and dedication earned them not just a hefty salary but also unparalleled benefits and compensation for their families.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The idea of abandoning all that to scrape by in hardship was unthinkable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Good! We&#x27;re not cowards. They have guns, but so do we. Ambush us? Big mistake. They all ended up dead anyway!&quot; Marvin lifted his assault rifle high with a defiant gesture that was a symbol of their unyielding resolve.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The team also raised their weapons, cheering as one. Their morale was higher than ever.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Boss will make sure the families of our fallen brothers are well taken care of. No one will be left behind!&quot; Marvin added his words like fire, pushing the team into a frenzy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">William cast a strange look at Marvin. Usually, the guy came across as rough and carefree, but in this moment, he knew exactly how to lead.</p></div>
