        <h1>Chapter 1060 Sensible</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having been fighting on Aetheris Street for more than 20 years, Chase had never met such an invincible yet young figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, suppressed his anger and fear, and said, "Sir, I admit that you are very powerful! However, I am deeply rooted in the Obsidian Gang. You can't help Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will give you a dividend of 50 million dollars every year if you give up helping Ariella. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella immediately panicked and glanced at Alexander worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, 50 million dollars was a fortune that most people couldn't earn in a few lifetimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, thinking that Chase, capable and composed, still attempted to bribe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to die, I can give you a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat down on the sofa arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase was overjoyed at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fright, Ariella trembled uncontrollably, wondering if she was abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nothing left and being poisoned, she lost her confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, go ahead. I will satisfy you as long as it is within my reach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase assumed a respectful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some members of the Sakra Society from Risun have come to Aetheris Street. Do you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at Chase with great interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase was stupefied. The members of the Sakra Society, those losers, had offended this big shot. Were they courting death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. In fact, there are just about 20 people, all of whom have stolen into the country. They only play with women. They are all immoral."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "They only play with women? Do you know that they are ogres?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They injure women and children. This is in Aetheris Street, the territory of the Obsidian Gang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ogres? T-They..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase became anxious, and everyone present shivered in fear a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Obsidian Gang dominated Aetheris Street and had a good relationship with the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if a severe case involving perverted ogres happened, the Obsidian Gang and the Aetheris Street would be implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know they are in Riverside Hotel. I'll have them caught and sent to the police station. Thank you for reminding me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase couldn't wait to prepare for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase, covered in cold sweat, gazed at him carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ariella is the rightful heir to the Obsidian Gang, but now you have forced her into desperation. Shouldn't you give up the position of the head of the gang first, according to common rules?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, you poisoned Ariella's father and fed her chronic poison. How will you pay for your crimes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at Chase fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's deep eyes betrayed his murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase freaked out and understood that he couldn't run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fought many a bloody battle and had been on the verge of death a thousand times, but Alexander's icy eyes made him petrified as if he had fallen into an ice hole.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander made a move, Chase rushed to him and pleaded, "I-I'm willing to give up my position as the head of the gang and become a loyal follower of Ms. Clarkson. But... But I have no antidote to the chronic poison. Please don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dumbfounded, the other members of the Obsidian Gang looked at Chase, once so domineering, begging for mercy like a dog in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella was hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lost her martial arts and was now dying. Even if she could get the position of the head of the gang back, it would be a bubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled playfully, "Oh? You are really sensible and smart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Chase was able to usurp the head of the Obsidian Gang. He was decisive, sophisticated, and not afraid of losing face.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, d-do you forgive me? I can serve you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase gazed at Alexander with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his finger and said coldly, "I don't want a subordinate that will betray me at any time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase shivered, pivoted around, and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his great strength, he was faster than a rabbit, but he was as slow as a snail in Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flicked his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible Force hit a machete on the floor, which flew over, penetrating Chase's chest and nailing him to the floor.</span></p></div>
