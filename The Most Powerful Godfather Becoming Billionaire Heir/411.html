        <h1>Chapter 411 Argument</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon shivered and stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every step he took back, Alexander moved one step closer, his anger intensifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thud, Simon involuntarily slumped down in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Simon confronted Felix, he had never felt such deep fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel did it on his own, and he just loves to catch pretty girls. I'm his cousin, so I can only defend him for the sake of us being related..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon blamed it on Daniel unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was shocked. Then, he growled angrily, "Simon, screw you! It was clearly you who wanted me to catch that woman and little girl!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could it be me? You obviously wanted to get that woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two start arguing, and they hit each other in front of Alexander, looking awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was confused. She had mixed feelings watching Simon act so cowardly in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was the director of the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Institute of the Red Umbrella Group, and he was an important person, but he was surprisingly so inferior in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you hit me for that bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep sense of loss and resentment enveloped Jane's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was another tumultuous rush of footsteps outside. A crowd had obviously come, and it was interspersed with shouting and yelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, don't let that asshole ran away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect Daniel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen men rushed in with various weapons in their hands, protecting Daniel as soon as they entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the security guards of the water park, Daniel's subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that, Daniel was delighted and thought that he was going to survive in a desperate situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instantly jumped up from the ground and pointed at Alexander, cursing, "Son of a bitch, how dare you hit me? Do you realize I'm the supervisor here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh, thinking, "You're just a supervisor at a water park. You are so short-sighted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare he laugh? Go ahead and break his hand first. If anything happens, I'll take the responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel arrogantly ordered his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way, all of you!" Alexander took the action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already moved around the crowd quickly without being noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sound, the men's machetes, crowbars, and other weapons fell. The guys who had just rushed in fell to the ground with screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you a devil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was horrified to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the one who will send you to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped Daniel on the forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crack, a crisp sound of bone cracking rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel fell to the ground like a rotten log that had been cut down, and he wailed as he held his head, which was cracked open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others all turned pale and didn't dare to speak again. Alexander was ruthless, they didn't dare to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you get out of here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander yelled, and the man who had fallen to the floor got up and ran outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the room fell into silence again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was already sweating profusely, not daring to imagine what would happen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane stared at Alexander blankly, and she couldn't remember how many times she'd been blamed by Alexander, and she'd become numb to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel wailed miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong! It was truly my fault! Simon came to me today and urged me to do it... It was him! It was really him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon immediately started arguing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't, I truly didn't do it. It's obviously you who likes pretty girls, and you tried to kidnap them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon looked angry as if he had been wronged by Daniel, and he was good at acting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had long been staring at Simon, his All-Seeing Eyes catching Simon lying like a lie detector, and Simon's heartbeat and blood pressure shifted dramatically as he lied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lying. You're from the Red Umbrella Group, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked Simon with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon kept stepping back in fear, thinking, "How did this guy know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander became even more certain of his suspicions and took large steps towards Simon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every step he took was like a sledgehammer hitting Simon's heart so forcefully that it was as if a death knell had sounded in Simon's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't come any closer. You will not die if you touch me, and I am a senior executive from the Vanderbilt family, so you'd better not make any trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon completely panicked. He threatened Alexander as he stepped back nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered </span><span>contemptuously,</span><span> his eyes filled with anger.</span></p></div>
