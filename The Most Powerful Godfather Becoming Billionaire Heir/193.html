        <h1>Chapter 193 Too Much to Bear</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Federer guy didn't bully you, did he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face flushed as she looked down, feeling embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, but he touched me a few times. You won't be mad, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I be mad? I'm more worried... If he dares to touch you, I'll definitely chop off his hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was filled with anger and jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava hugged him tightly, saying, "Darling, thank you for protecting me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Ava and kissed her, and soon they fell onto the big bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, this thong looks amazing on you. So sexy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers danced over her like he was playing the piano, gently caressing and lingering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was immersed in a wonderfully blissful world, reluctant to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was going to wear it just for you... but then that scoundrel Gary kidnapped me. His facial mask was incredible, exactly like Dominic's! It was developed by the Federer family, and it looks so real," Ava panted as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind raced at the thought of such a realistic facial mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They definitely need to get that. It would </span><span>be useful</span><span> on Treasure Island and give him another reason to deal with Gary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's body was soft and fragrant, especially her plump breasts that emitted a faint, alluring scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's uncomfortable; stop teasing me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was lost in Alexander's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of Alexander's previous powerful </span><span>actions</span><span> flashed in her mind, causing a warm rush between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed her down, kissing and </span><span>touching</span><span> her passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's mind was foggy, and she urged. "Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her eager expression made Alexander's breathing heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Ava was completely undressed, her smooth, white body exposed to the air, radiating irresistible charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but play and explore, lost in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned and softly complained. "It hurts; be gentle..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and continued his exploration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s </span><span>eyes were filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped hesitating and went straight for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Ava was completely spent, her gaze dreamy. She was mumbling...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the night, lightning flashed across the sky, followed by a booming thunder that was quite terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, with her eyes closed, sleepily nestled closer to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour of intense "exercise" had truly worn her out, and coupled with the fright, she fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander couldn't sleep at all; he was busy contacting Augusta and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much had happened recently, and it was all so unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, the Fraternity attacked the headquarters, and then Alexander </span><span>took</span><span> Ian</span><span> as </span><span>a subordinate</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Gary kidnapped Ava, but thankfully she managed to escape, although the </span><span>problem</span><span> was far from over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary and Oscar both sent messages about big moves from the Federer family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gathered more than a hundred people overnight, including Edward, the top </span><span>fighter</span><span> from the Federer family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a large operation couldn't </span><span>go without notice from</span><span> The Blood Gang and The Kaylon, who had </span><span>spies in</span><span> the Federer family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered; Gary really thought he was </span><span>easy to take down</span><span>. After failing to kidnap Ava, he was now trying to break in at night&mdash;how overconfident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain poured down heavily as Alexander quietly got out of bed, glanced at the soundly sleeping Ava, and then leaped out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mere second floor was nothing for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from William protecting his daughter, Augusta, Marvin, Charlize, and over a hundred members from Ultimate Alliance and the Fraternity were already </span><span>hiding</span><span> in ambush around the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't inform Alice; he couldn't hide from her eyes if he established his own operation, but he had to keep a low profile to avoid angering Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain drizzled down, and Alexander showed no intention of seeking shelter. He stood proudly in the rain, letting it wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the storm, Alexander's eyes and ears could detect any movement </span><span>300</span><span> </span><span>feet</span><span> away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already past three in the morning, and with the heavy rain, there was not a single person or car in sight, yet a large convoy was </span><span>coming quickly</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three big buses and </span><span>a dozen of</span><span> black sedans rushed forward.</span></p></div>
