        <h1>Chapter 681 Unlocking Potential</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than an hour, Betty lay weak in Alexander's arms, gently stroking his firm chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, Charlize is being discharged tomorrow. Will you be picking her up?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'll be there!" Alexander replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize had been injured in the line of duty, and he wasn't about to neglect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few more minutes in each other's embrace, Betty left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt the Force coursed through his body, filling him with an invigorated vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain himself, he left the study and headed to a small grove nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single punch, he tore through the air, his fist force splitting it with a booming sound and driving straight through a tree trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tree as thick as a bowl cracked and snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single punch, exerting only a fraction of his strength, had generated a sonic boom and broken a sizable tree trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those so-called fighting masters couldn't even block a single punch from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Punch after punch, Alexander's strikes came faster and faster. In mere moments, he had leveled numerous trees, his strength far surpassing what it had been before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he just wanted to test his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His punching speed increased rapidly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seventy-two consecutive punches, he finally felt his chest tighten, a breath he could no longer hold in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who saw what had just happened would be in utter disbelief. Knocking down over seventy trees in a single go was the feat of a superhuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was equivalent to Alexander defeating seventy-two martial arts masters in one breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was quite pleased with the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next few days, Alexander used high-grade gemstones to craft a new batch of protective amulets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone </span><span>close</span><span> to him received one, even the top members of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, in particular, received special attention. Although she was fully healed, her appearance and figure perfectly restored, Alexander decided to help her reach new heights in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using a spell from the Ultimate Legacy, Alexander crafted 108 enchanted gemstones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the gemstones was engraved with intricate magical runes, faintly glowing </span><span>with an air of mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlize, I'm going to use this magic circle to help you unlock your full potential. It might be painful. Can you bear it?" Alexander asked solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize blinked, then nodded resolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm not afraid! Go ahead; I can handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, I promise you won't regret it. Think of this as a reward for your loyalty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied, Alexander patted her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arranged the 108 gemstones into a magic circle and instructed Charlize to sit cross-legged in its center, preparing for meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander activated the magic circle, there were faint arcs of electricity that began to crackle around it, and a mysterious vortex formed around Charlize, swirling steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From within the vortex, the reflections of all 108 gemstones appeared, glowing with an extraordinary radiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlize, I'm now raising your potential limits. It will hurt, but you must endure it. Can you handle that?" Alexander asked solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's face was set with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I crave strength. Go ahead. I'm not afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander praised her, then began channeling the Force into the magic circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 108 gemstones pulsed continuously, and a surge of life energy emerged from the vortex, rapidly integrating into Charlize's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's vision darkened, her blood seeming to boil, her body on the verge of exploding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a searing energy flooded into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! It's so hot... it hurts..." she cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bear with it," Alexander reminded her. "Didn't you say you desired great power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne, I'll endure it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize gritted her teeth, her face contorted with pain but remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the pain began to subside, and tiny specks of gemstone light started to glimmer beneath her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several hours later, the 108 gemstones had lost their luster, shattering into fragments of ordinary stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The energy within each gemstone had been fully absorbed by Charlize's body.</span></p></div>
