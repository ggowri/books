        <h1>Chapter 1233 Race Against Time</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wild </span><span>cat's</span><span> jaws gaped wide before it tore the guy's head clean off, sending blood spraying like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wild cat let out an excited shriek, its blood-red eyes wild as it kept picking off the people at the front of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time, it went straight for the head, killing its prey with savage efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson couldn't stand to watch anymore. "Snipers, open fire!" he barked. "Save whoever you can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rifle shots cracked through the air. Several rounds tore into the wildcat, leaving wounds the size of a ball and making the beast howl in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even after taking multiple hits from high-powered sniper rounds, the thing wouldn't go down. Instead, it turned and charged straight for the wall, more enraged than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill it! Now!" Karson shouted, his face going pale. He knew these mutant cats could leap incredible heights. If it made it to their makeshift wall, they'd be looking at a bloodbath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More shots rang out in rapid succession. Two bullets found their mark in the beast's massive skull, with one shot going straight through its eye socket and into its brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the mutant wildcat let out one last horrific screech before it collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone broke into a cold sweat. These mutant beasts were getting tougher to kill&mdash;their hides were thicker, their flesh more resistant. That wasn't good news for anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last group of survivors was closing in now, about </span><span>220 yards</span><span> out from safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move in for the rescue," Karson ordered through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy iron gates swung open, and dozens of dock workers charged out with their assault rifles at the ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, they were just ordinary workers before all this, but fighting these mutant beasts had turned them into hardened fighters. They opened fire on any creature that dared get near the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them had lost contact with their own families and friends&mdash;probably dead by now&mdash;so they had a bone to pick with these monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp cracks of sniper rifles mixed with the rapid-fire bursts of automatic weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the heavy barrage, dozens of mutant beasts of all sizes hit the ground howling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike zombies or the living dead, these creatures could still feel pain even with their tough hides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet storm was too much for them. The mutant beasts started backing off with pained yelps and growls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lucky survivors finally made it through the iron gates and behind the makeshift walls. As soon as they were safe, they broke down crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fall back, now!" A sharp command cut through the air from one of the female squad members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workers quickly huddled together in a circular formation, moving backward step by step. Some were already swapping out their magazines, not taking any chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the stench&mdash;followed by the roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mutated ape, standing over seven feet tall, suddenly launched itself through the air. The beast cleared nearly 100 feet in a single bound, aiming straight for the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its eyes glowed blood-red, and its mouth was packed with razor-sharp fangs. Each massive paw ended in gleaming claws that looked sharp enough to slice through steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature slashed down at one of the dock workers, who stood frozen in terror. The poor guy had gone white as a sheet, his gun forgotten in his trembling hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like hell you will!" A woman's voice rang out as she burst into action. She was quite a sight&mdash;built like an athlete but rocking a squad machine gun like it was nothing. Brass ammo belts crossed her body like some kind of deadly fashion statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened up with the machine gun, her battle cry mixing with the weapon's roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muzzle flashed like a miniature sun as she let loose, the stream of rounds cutting through the air like a whip made of fire. Her aim was dead-on, catching the mutant ape right in the head with the burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regular bullets would've just wounded that mutant ape, maybe slowed it down a bit. But this woman was something else&mdash;her bullets had this faint glow around them. That was the kind of thing only see from metahuman with firearm power, and she had to be at least a level-two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shot connected, and the ape's head just exploded. Blood and brain matter went flying everywhere while its massive body hit the ground, thrashing around like a fish out of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workers, both on and below the wall, erupted in cheers. The sight of their success fired them up, and they started hitting the mutants even harder than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That ape had been the biggest threat among all these mutant beasts, and now that their leader was down, the rest of the pack started scrambling away like scared dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Karson and the woman weren't celebrating. If anything, they looked more worried than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were burning through ammo just to take down a handful of these mutants. Without backup, they were in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the signal relay stations were toast, leaving them completely cut off from the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though this crisis had only started yesterday, Karson felt like he had been fighting for ages.</span></p></div>
