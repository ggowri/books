        <h1>Chapter 913 Evil Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered coldly. He hadn't expected to see that shameless woman here. And not only was Elaine present, but she seemed to be running the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine's dazzling smile lit up her delicate features as she addressed the room with unrestrained enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Focusing his force, Alexander tuned into their conversation. The voices in the room came through crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the researchers practically beamed as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Bell, this is a breakthrough! With our latest progress, the launch date for the Apocalypse Project can be moved up again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine </span><span>nodded,</span><span> her satisfaction evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fantastic. Eddie is already gathering forces on the outskirts of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. He has a zombie army of over a hundred, ready to strike at any moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice brimmed with excitement as she continued. "Once Eddie makes his move, we'll collect even more data. That will bring us closer to unlocking true immortality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone in the room let out a derisive laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can destroy </span><span>Loscity</span><span> in the process, even better. Let them see who they're </span><span>messing with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are destined to rule the world. We are the most superior race, and soon, all of humanity will kneel before us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we," Elaine declared, her voice rising to a crescendo, "will live forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her arms dramatically, like a charismatic leader rallying her troops. Her fervor was contagious, and the researchers cheered wildly in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden in the shadows, Alexander clenched his fists. These people were deranged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His suspicions had been correct. Sakra Society was planning to unleash chaos in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. A bioweapon attack wasn't just on the table. It was imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind raced. If he could take out their research team, the Apocalypse Project would be dead in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From there, he'd hunt down every living dead they'd created and snuff out this nightmare before it truly began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A researcher interrupted his thoughts. "Dr. Bell, should we test the new immortality serum? Let's see if it works as expected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine showed a self-satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already conducted the tests, and this new immortality serum behaves very differently from the earlier versions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Previously, anyone injected would immediately transform into one of the living dead. But this time, our monitoring revealed some fascinating anomalies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gestured toward a screen nearby, her excitement spilling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The subject's brainwaves are heightened, incredibly active. There's even a hint, just a hint of consciousness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps filled the room, followed by an eruption of applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine, however, raised a hand to temper their enthusiasm. "Unfortunately, the subject eventually lost that spark of awareness. It reverted to a typical mindless undead state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this anomaly proves we're on the right track. Give us three more months, and we'll have a perfected immortality serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will be the most groundbreaking discovery in human history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And all of us, each and every one of you, will go down in the annals of greatness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The researchers cheered, their faces alight with zeal. Satisfied with their energy, Elaine clasped her hands together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've worked hard. Keep at it. I have other pressing matters to attend to. But soon, very soon, the Apocalypse Project will come to fruition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We, the </span><span>Risun</span><span> people, are destined to reign supreme. The world will bow before us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The researchers roared their agreement, thrilled at the thought of restoring their country's former glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave it to us, Dr. Bell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final wave, Elaine strutted out of the room, her movements oozing confidence and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his hiding spot, Alexander's gaze turned icy. His rage simmered beneath the surface, threatening to boil over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These maniacs!" he thought, grinding his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human experiments, immortality serums, world domination? They're out of their minds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes sharpened, his fury simmering beneath a calculated calm. He knew he couldn't let their twisted plans come to fruition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The urge to take Elaine down right then and there was almost unbearable, but he restrained himself and stared at those researchers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a burly man with a smug grin stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll grab a fresh subject for our next test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes narrowed as he silently trailed the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now wasn't the time to act impulsively. He needed to find Hazel first. Only then could he dismantle their operation.</span></p></div>
