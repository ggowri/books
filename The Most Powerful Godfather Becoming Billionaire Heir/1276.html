        <h1>Chapter 1276 Shifting Target</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutant panther growled low in its throat as it backed away slowly, not daring to turn and run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the animal kingdom, turning its back on a predator meant certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature made rumbling noises deep in its throat, searching for any opening in Alexander's defense while continuing its careful retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept his eyes locked on the beast, following its movements unhurriedly, shopping basket still in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood continued to flow from the panther's wound, dripping onto the ground below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, the mutant panther realized it wasn't just trapped. The pain from its wound was getting worse by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, driven by desperation, it lunged at Alexander once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You beast!" Alexander roared as he grabbed the mutant panther's massive head with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand looked almost comically small against the panther's skull, yet it acted like a powerful magnet, holding the panther in place despite its desperate struggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutant panther let out furious roars, its huge body twisting and thrashing, but it couldn't break free from Alexander's iron grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die," Alexander said coldly, his voice dripping with lethal intent. The Force exploded from his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crack, the panther's reinforced skull split open, and its body collapsed to the ground in violent spasms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared down at the creature with cold eyes. Even as it lay dying, the panther's blood-red eyes remained fixed on him, burning with a mixture of hatred, savagery, and pure loathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback. The mutant clearly possessed a high level of intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to turn away and leave the creature to its death, a blast of searing flames shot out from behind him. His lightning-fast reflexes saved him, but the edge of the flames still caught him, burning through his clothes and singeing his hair, leaving behind an acrid smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After unleashing that final burst of fire, the mutant panther immediately weakened, its eyes sliding shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander delivered one last crushing stomp to its head. Only when he saw the panther's skull cave in did he finally let out a breath of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a close call. The flames had been intense enough to do some serious damage. If he'd been hit directly, he would've been lucky to survive at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up!" Alexander's eyes caught a glimpse of something gleaming inside the mutant panther's shattered skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be what he thought it was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a careful inspection, Alexander's hunch was right. He'd found another low-level energy core. That made two in total now&mdash;one from the Mutated Monkey King, and this one from the panther.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd taken down his fair share of mutant beasts and zombies, but these were the only cores he'd found. It seemed like only the higher-ranked mutants carried them. Alexander did the math&mdash;he needed ten cores total to upgrade his Lightsabers to level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking it over, Alexander hacked off one of the panther's massive legs and stuffed it into his shopping basket before heading into the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never tried mutant panther meat before, but with the Force protecting him from any negative effects, he figured it was worth a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The zombies that had scattered earlier when the panther was alive were now picking up the scent of its blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came pouring in from every direction, drawn by the smell. Within minutes, hundreds&mdash;maybe thousands&mdash;of zombies packed the street, shoving and clawing at each other like rabid dogs as they fought to get to the panther's carcass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending several more days waiting at the hotel with no new leads, Alexander decided it was time to move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His next stop would be the Dragon Gang headquarters to find Norma. She might be his best shot at getting information about Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander packed his travel bag with some cooked leopard meat, bottled water, and canned food. He threw the backpack over his shoulder and headed downstairs, humming to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day before, he'd lucked out and found a decent bicycle. It was perfect for getting around&mdash;faster than walking, required less energy, and best of all, he wouldn't have to deal with all the abandoned cars clogging up the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pedaled toward the Dragon Gang headquarters, but the debris-covered streets and occasional zombie encounters kept slowing him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In normal times, the trip from Sakra Tower to the Dragon Gang headquarters would take about an hour by car. Now, Alexander figured it would take him two or three days to get there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his paper map to check his position and spotted a potential shortcut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of pushing through the city center, he could swing through the suburbs before heading back into the city near the Dragon Gang headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suburbs had fewer zombies, which meant he could maintain a decent speed on his bike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the route was longer, he'd probably get to the Dragon Gang headquarters faster this way.</span></p></div>
