        <h1>Chapter 714 Devoted</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spread Cloe's buttocks and licked them directly with the tip of his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were extremely tender and smooth, with a shower gel scent mixed with a hint of sweetness that turned him on.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe got slapped on the buttocks and couldn't help but moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Mr. Hawthorne, you are awesome..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander activated the Force and pressed his hands on her buttocks, kneading and stroking. Cloe was going crazy and felt burning hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her slightly drooping large breasts swayed with her movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I can't stand it. I want you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe clasped Alexander's arms tightly with both hands and pulled him towards herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He admired her coquettish and lustful look and was filled with a sense of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please. What are you waiting for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Where is the lubricant you prepared? I need it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's body suddenly went limp, and she lost all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-It's ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed as she stumbled to the bedside table, opened the drawer, and took out a bottle of lubricant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe knelt between Alexander's legs, holding the lubricant in her hands, and her beautiful eyes betrayed her pleading and expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned back on the sofa and made a gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After obediently unzipping his pants, Cloe took out his penis, buried her head deeply, and tried hard to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he couldn't help it. He touched her pretty face, stared at the saliva at the corner of her mouth, and chuckled, "Kneel down, little slut."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly stood up, lay down compliantly, and pulled her buttocks with her hands, begging impatiently, "Mr. Hawthorne, welcome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the lubricant, injected it, and then squeezed his penis inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss! It indeed feels different. It's terribly tight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's speed gradually increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe lay there limply. Every time he entered her, she felt as if her internal organs were being moved...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander began to breathe heavily, his waist and hips swinging faster and faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was almost beside herself. Her body was writhing like a snake, and she was rubbing her ample breasts with both hands.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander came, she had already fallen into a coma. She trembled slightly, immersed in sexual pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carried Cloe, who was completely weak, to the bed and held her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After resting for a while, she finally woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I am going crazy, but I like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing out loud. As long as he could conquer a woman in bed, she would be devoted to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a slut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spanked her big buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe groaned, snuggled into his arms, and fell asleep happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, was still energetic and not drowsy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his cell phone and found that there were dozens of unread messages, all from Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been busy with the decisive battle with Felix and the affairs of Treasure Island. His phone had been silent the whole time, and he hadn't texted back, so Ava must be worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 09:12, she asked: [Is everything going well? I miss you so much!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 09:50, she said: [Did something happen? I am worried.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 10:30, she asked: [Have you been seduced by a beautiful girl? Why don't you reply to my messages?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 10:45, she continued: [God bless you. I don't dare to call you for fear of disturbing you. There is a mysterious man who has been constantly appearing recently. I think he is following me. It is really annoying.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 11:12, she asked: [Something is wrong in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> recently, with so many people suffering from colds and coughs. Could it be that the influenza has broken out early?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled helplessly. He was indeed to blame for not responding in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's words gave him a premonition. A mysterious man was following her? An early outbreak of influenza?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, eager to go back, quickly messaged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I'm sorry. I was really busy and forgot about it. Also, the situation was special, so my phone was on silent mode, and I didn't see the messages! Don't worry. I'll be back as soon as possible.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he contacted Betty and Marvin and asked them to protect Ava.</span></p></div>
