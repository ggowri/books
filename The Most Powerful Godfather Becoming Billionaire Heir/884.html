        <h1>Chapter 884 Reliable Intel</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! They've even got this stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin couldn't help but curse. There was even a Vulcan cannon and shoulder-mounted portable missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined, these weapons could outfit an entire reinforced company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll pick out a few for ourselves and give the rest to the guys. The Sakra Society is a local force in </span><span>Risun</span><span>. Wiping them out completely would be tough for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Mafia's different. Their branch is right here in </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>. If we destroy it entirely, it'll be a major blow to them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually flipped open a few wooden crates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ammunition crates, nailed shut with rivets, were effortlessly pried open by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incredible strength made Shadow and Marvin's faces change slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they could pull it off themselves, they certainly couldn't do it with Alexander's ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I've been itching for some action!" Marvin exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, Marvin began selecting his weapons of choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Too bad we can't take this beast," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin ran his hand over the Gatling gun, commonly known as the Vulcan cannon, grinning foolishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With its terrifying firing rate of thousands of rounds per minute, the Vulcan cannon was an absolute killing machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once fired, it could unleash a storm of destruction, leveling everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from someone like Alexander, most mutated individuals would be reduced to a pile of minced flesh under such firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If several Vulcan cannons were combined with elite snipers in a coordinated ambush against Alexander...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he would find it difficult to escape unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow pulled two folding submachine guns from one of the crates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These compact submachine guns boasted high firing rates and modified oversized magazines, offering a perfect blend of mobility and firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Alexander, Marvin, and Shadow equipped themselves with a full set of combat gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This included tactical suits, bulletproof helmets, vests, night-vision goggles, binoculars, knives, pistols, and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They packed everything into large tactical backpacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, Alexander prepared a sniper rifle and two sharp mountain-cleaving blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Force, Alexander could use the sniper rifle to take out enemies from several miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the cleaving blades, Alexander had specifically instructed Shadow to have them forged by a blacksmith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In "Resident Evil," the protagonist Alice favored the kukri dagger, but Alexander believed the cleaving blades packed more power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a middle-aged man in a gray suit frowned as he scanned the latest reports.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander's in </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>? Is the intel reliable?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man and a woman stood respectfully by his side, too afraid to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Assemble the strongest forces in the branch immediately. I don't want Alexander leaving </span><span>Kylaville</span><span> alive. Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chilling order seemed to drop the temperature in the room by several degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Welsh!" the woman replied loudly, her ample chest trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man gave a mysterious smile and said, "Alexander is too arrogant to come to </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>. We've already hired a legendary ninja. He's as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A legendary ninja?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman immediately lifted her head, her previously hesitant expression now replaced with joy and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the legendary ninja made a move, no matter how powerful Alexander was, his end would be inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander," the man chuckled, "once you're gone, I'll become the second-in-command of the Mafia, just below the Godfather himself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the suit curled his lips into a sinister smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and his two companions climbed into a Toyota, their tactical backpacks in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them followed over a dozen vehicles, carrying Shadow's heavily armed subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander checked the time. It was almost midnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark, windy night was perfect for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single command, Alexander ordered, "Move out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Shadow eagerly suited up, their adrenaline pumping in anticipation of the upcoming battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Toyota led the way, keeping his men trailing at a safe distance behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Alexander and his team infiltrated the Mafia branch, the elite squad would begin their assault from the outside, tightening their encirclement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander and his companions arrived at their destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden wind had picked up, and dark clouds blanketed the sky. The streets were deserted, cloaked in an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Alexander stepped out of the car, he quickly turned, his sharp gaze locking onto a shadowy corner.</span></p></div>
