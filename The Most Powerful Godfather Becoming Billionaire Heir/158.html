        <h1>Chapter 158 Have a Look</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jennifer noticed Xavier still hadn't given her a straight answer, she huffed in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't even take me to see it? This little thing shows just how unreliable you are, and you claim to love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier didn't want to lose Jennifer now, especially after finally getting her alone for some fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was curious about the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor himself and wanted to see what made it so special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been empty for ages. What are the odds the owner would show up just when we do?" Xavier mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, he gritted his teeth and relented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, babe, I'll take you. It's just a chance to meet the neighbors, right? What's the big deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Mr. Ulysses, you're an owner here too, so what's there to be scared of?" Jennifer exclaimed, her excitement bubbling over as she snuggled into his arms, her hand slipping into his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier felt a jolt of energy course through him at her playful touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After we check it out, I promise to take good care of you, Mr. Ulysses," she teased, her laughter ringing like music in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling invigorated, Xavier took her hand, and they set off toward the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire estate sprawled over a vast area, even wrapping around half of a </span><span>picturesque hill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they climbed the elegantly designed path leading to the manor halfway up the slope, Xavier kept glancing around nervously, worried they might get caught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the surroundings were serene, with lush trees blocking any prying eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, he relaxed, even starting to playfully tease Jennifer as if they were just a couple out for a leisurely stroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't realize was that as soon as they stepped onto the private grounds of the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor, they were already under the watchful gaze of the patrol team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of his status as an owner and the fact they were just on the outskirts of the villa, the patrol reported their presence but chose not to take immediate action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been incidents in the past where a thief had ventured onto the property only to be caught by the patrols and left bruised and battered. The thief had been hung up at the estates' entrance for three days before being released, only to hire a lawyer and sue for assault and false imprisonment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the powerful figures behind Grand Hyatt Estates made sure that the thief simply vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they continued their trek, Jennifer was panting, beads of sweat glistening on her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her top was soaked through, and even the back of her denim shorts bore dark patches from the heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of mansion is built halfway up a mountain? Climbing up and down like this is exhausting!" she complained, wiping her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier playfully smacked her on the backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad we're not the owners of the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor. If we were, we could drive right up or even hop on a cable car. I heard there's even a helipad halfway up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who can afford a billion-dollar mansion surely isn't shy about buying a helicopter. They say the view from up there overlooks all of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. It must be stunning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer's eyes widened in awe. "Wow, only the super-rich can enjoy a place like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The owner of the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor must be one of the top tycoons in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Mr. Ulysses, do you know who it is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier rubbed the back of his head awkwardly, struggling to keep his cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, of course, I know the owner. My mom is a pretty well-known jeweler in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>! The owner here is that mysterious chairman from the Saint Group, but I can't just go spilling the beans about him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Mr. Ulysses, you're impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer coiled around him like a playful serpent, her affection palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their exchanges interspersed with kisses and playful embraces, they finally mustered the energy to conquer the last few steps, arriving at the sprawling lawn in front of the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stood before the grand, castle-like edifice, they were taken aback, feeling as though they had been transported back in time to a world of medieval nobility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, let's go check it out!" Jennifer urged, excitement sparking in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier hesitated, a frown creasing his forehead. "I don't know if that's a good idea..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Mr. Ulysses, please? There's no one inside. Just think about it&mdash;we could get cozy, and it would be so romantic, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She caressed his chest gently, her voice dripping with persuasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught up in the thrill of the moment, Xavier felt his resolve begin to crumble. Before he knew it, he swept Jennifer into his arms and headed towards the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the grand door, ready to make their break, the sound of a booming voice sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few imposing figures clad in matching uniforms swiftly closed in on them, their fierce glares setting the atmosphere ablaze with tension.</span></p></div>
