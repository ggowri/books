        <h1>Chapter 1009 The Unexpected Twist</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty didn't even have time to blink. The enemy's movements were a blur, faster than anything she'd ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This guy is an expert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "He's so strong that he defeats the many all by himself, utterly crushing his enemies in a one-sided slaughter. This guy has to be a high-level speed metahuman, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Windwolf</span><span>, back to me!" Asher demanded indifferently. </span><span>Windwolf</span><span> obeyed without a moment's hesitation, slipping into position behind Asher like a perfectly trained dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher smirked, his eyes drinking in the shock on Betty's face. He was loving this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty," he said slowly with smug superiority, "they say smart folks know when to get on the right side of the fence. So, what'll it be? Join me, or do you want to die today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let his gaze linger on her, especially on her hot body, a sly grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He warned viciously, "Here's the deal. Every three seconds, if you don't surrender, I'll have </span><span>Windwolf</span><span> take out one of your people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's face flushed with rage, her body trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher was about to hit "three" when his phone buzzed to life. It was Ethan </span><span>Vance,</span><span> the leader of the task force Asher had sent to take down the Ultimate Alliance's stronghold in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he swiped to accept the video call, he muttered, "Guess you're in luck. I'll deal with this first. Ethan, you guys..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even finish his sentence, his eyes darted to the video screen on his mobile phone, and fear shot through him like a jolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, covered in blood, appeared on the screen. Behind him, a group of similarly bloodied figures huddled together. They were all members of the Vance family, all looking terrified and wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, a large group of men in black surged forward like a pack of tigers pouncing on their prey. In an instant, they had Ethan and the others completely surrounded. They weren't as fast as </span><span>Windwolf</span><span>, but they were brutal and efficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's heart raced. "What the hell is going on? Those screams I heard earlier were from our people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan and his team were trapped, like deer caught in the headlights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video, Augusta slowly rose to his feet, a sinister grin spreading across his face. He looked directly into the camera and waved his hand dismissively as he declared, "Kill them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of shouts and screams erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Ethan's allies fought with all they had, their efforts were no match for the relentless and overwhelming skill of their opponents. With each passing moment, the number of people still standing beside Ethan dwindled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Mr. Vance, they're too strong! We're surrounded! We're going to be wiped </span><span>out!" Ethan yelled with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this desperate moment, he could only clutch at one last thread of hope, Asher. Faced with Augusta's overwhelming power, their entire group was being crushed without mercy. Every attempt to fight back was swiftly snuffed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ethan screamed as his phone slipped from his grasp and went flying. The phone, still recording, wobbled violently and finally hit the ground with a dull thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher's face darkened, but his eyes were glued to the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, someone picked up the phone, turning the camera back to Ethan and the others, who were forced to their knees, heads bowed in defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asher," he sneered, revealing a set of slightly sinister white teeth, "you're a dead man tonight. And before you join your ancestors in hell, you'll watch your beloved family meet their end, one by one. Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his command, one of his men swung his blade in a brutal arc, severing Ethan's head from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered across the ground and walls. The severed head flew through the air and rolled several feet, coming to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in death, Ethan's eyes were wide open, staring into the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video, members of the Vance family were murdered one by one, their screams echoing through the phone's speakers, filling the room with the gruesome sound of slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and the members of the Ultimate Alliance watched, hearts pounding with excitement. They initially assumed Alexander was not taking any immediate action. But what they never could have imagined was that the ones being slaughtered weren't members of the alliance at all. Those falling under the blade were actually members of the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher watched in horror as the members of the Vance family dropped to the ground, each one writhing and wailing in their final moments. His face had gone from pale to a deep, livid red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even through the screen of the phone, he felt like he could smell the pungent, metallic stench of blood hanging heavy in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the last member of the Vance family collapsed to the ground, and the video call went dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Asher shouted, "Goddamn it! Damn you, Alexander! I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice shook with uncontrollable fury, veins bulging in his neck as he clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Windwolf</span><span>! Kill them all! Don't leave a single one alive! Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, </span><span>Windwolf's</span><span> eyes flashed with a savage light. He surged forward, lunging at Betty with a snarl of rage.</span></p></div>
