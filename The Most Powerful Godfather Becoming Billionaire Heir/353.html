        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "I am playing a long game! You go back first, and I'll follow them and see who is behind Arthur."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany asked worriedly, "Are you going alone? Isn't it too dangerous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. They are just the Mafia, and they are no match for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blushed slightly. "Okay. I'll go back to the hotel and wait for you. Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned for a moment. Instead of going home, she decided to wait for him at the hotel. Her intention was self-evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take the room card. I'll be back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander handed over the room card without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll wait for you. Come back soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany gently touched Alexander's hand and gazed at him tenderly with her watery eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending her to a taxi, he chased after Arthur and his men. They supported each other and staggered into several cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow the cars ahead. Don't let them notice us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hailed a taxi and gave the driver a few large bills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver became excited and stalked them carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, Arthur and his men pulled up in front of a bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't walk in calmly until they all entered the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't very big, only a few hundred square yards, but it was crowded. The air was mingled with the odor of alcohol and the distinctive aroma of the magic powder.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced around and found that most of the customers were enjoying the pleasure brought by the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned. The more popular the magic powder became, the greater the profit he would make.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur waved all his men away and then stepped into a quiet corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waited for a while. After confirming that no one was paying attention to him, he secretly entered the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very long. He turned left and spotted a thick wooden door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander vaguely overheard the conversation within. Like a cat on the attack, he kept his every footstep as silent as possible.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, an unattractive middle-aged man, Timothy, lay on his back comfortably, with two young women in scanty bikinis massaging him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Arthur enter the room dejectedly, he asked seriously, "Arthur, I heard that you were beaten up. What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur replied with a dark face, "Timothy, it's Alexander Hawthorne who is wanted for 100 million dollars on the Dark Web. He attacked us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy immediately sat up and pushed the two women aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure it's him? He's a man worth 100 million dollars, and he has the magic formula. We can't let him leave </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur showed a fearful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Timothy, Alexander is too powerful. I brought more than a dozen of my robust men with me, but he defeated them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy calmed down in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur was his most capable right-hand man, and he had many ruthless men under his command who had fought a lot, but they had all been beaten up by Alexander, so Timothy had to think hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arthur, this is our best chance to make a great contribution! A reward of 100 million dollars is nothing compared to the magic powder formula. We must get the formula!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Timothy, Alexander is formidable. We are really no match for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur couldn't help shivering and was very scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy snorted coldly, "Loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid. I'll take care of it this time. I've been fighting underground for twenty years and have won the </span><span>black market</span><span> boxing championship several times. Can't I beat a twenty-something brat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur suddenly became thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Timothy, if you lead the team, we will definitely take Alexander. After all, you have worked hard to get to your current position in the Mafia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity that there are so many capable people in the Mafia that I can only be a mere two-star member."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur thought of something and asked cautiously, "Timothy, I heard that our Godfather is going to deal with that old guy, right? Making great achievements in the operation will help you be promoted to a four-star or even a five-star member."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Godfather, Mr. Satan, and Reaper, also at the Godfather level, will have a final battle to decide who is the true king of the Underworld!"</span></p></div>
