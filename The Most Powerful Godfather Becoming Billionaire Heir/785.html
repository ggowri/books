        <h1>Chapter 785 Kill Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew that the strong were respected in the City of Sorcery. Only Monica was a white wizard before, so everyone acknowledged that she was the city lord and the master of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now that Rock had also become a white wizard, the relationship between the two had become very delicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, if Yvonne hadn't used the amulet as bait today, she wouldn't have allowed the two to fall out openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Alexander's planning, the distrust and mutual fear between Monica and Rock broke out ahead of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock's eyes were filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Alexander, you are too arrogant! You are not allowed to sow discord between Ms. Quinn and me. Today, I will kill you in front of everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica pointed at Alexander. "If you kill him, I will share the power and wealth with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock became excited at once. He didn't expect Monica to give in so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although half of the power couldn't satisfy Rock's ambition, Rock did not want to fight with Monica for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill him! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of wizards roared wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock was like a tiger about to start hunting, with murderous intent in his eyes. He locked onto Alexander and was ready to attack at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled contemptuously, "It's still uncertain who will be killed today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock couldn't bear it anymore, thinking, "This guy is too arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slammed the Ancient Grimoire hard, and black gas enveloped his body. He pounced on Alexander like a devil from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black gas suddenly expanded and turned into a giant palm that pressed down toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The evil aura surged like a tide, submerging the entire hall. The air around Alexander seemed to solidify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attack of the white wizard was indeed powerful. But Alexander stood there motionless as if he was frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock grinned grimly. The giant black palm was about to smack Alexander to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne screamed in fright. Her pretty face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sneered, "How dare you compete with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bright light flashed and cut the giant black palm in half instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alexander swung the Lightsaber, all the wizards involuntarily stiffened up and broke out in cold sweat. Even the soles of their feet were soaked with sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander just stabbed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without any tricks, the saber pierced through all the black gas and directly pierced Rock's left arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A shrill howl sounded. Rock, who had just been arrogant just now, had his left arm cut off by Alexander's saber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood gushed out like a fountain, and Rock's expression was terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised his broken arm violently, and his blood splattered onto the Ancient Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like a drunkard craving for liquor. It absorbed all the blood and immediately burst out with an unprecedented, terrifying aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Monica felt this terrifying evil aura, and her face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A jet of inky black mist rushed out from the Ancient Grimoire and instantly condensed into a giant black ghost head, which opened its bloody mouth and flew towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a weird and terrifying scene made the wizards present tremble in fear. Was this the devil from hell?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander swung his saber without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Black energy burst out from the ghost head, and the two violent forces collided fiercely, creating a hurricane in the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone staggered and couldn't stand steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who were closer flew backward and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That terrifying black ghost head was actually split in half by Alexander's saber, just like cutting a cake with a knife, effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock's expression changed drastically. He and the ghost head were one, and he immediately felt that his body was cut in half by a sharp saber, painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned and wanted to run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you want to run? Can you?" sneered Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Lightsaber was swung towards Rock's back, and a scorching hot saber light rushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying energy cut Rock in half in an instant. Even the hard floor was cracked into a bottomless groove, emitting scorching heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander unleashed Level 2 Lightsaber's strongest energy, making it indestructible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two halves of Rock's body were still twisting on the ground, and black gas appeared at the wound, trying desperately to stick the two halves together.</span></p></div>
