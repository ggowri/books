        <h1>Chapter 1220 Storming the Base</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved through the pitch-black forest like a ghost, leaving only brief screams and the dull thuds of falling bodies in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The darkness was so thick that other people might not even see their hand, but that didn't slow him down. He spotted each guard post long before they had a chance to spot him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came across a makeshift treehouse perched on an old oak tree that would've taken two people to wrap their arms around. A faint orange light flickered inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without making a sound, Alexander appeared next to a black-clad guard who had dozed off at his post.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One quick tap to the forehead was all it took&mdash;the Force blast scrambled the guy's brain stem before he even hit the ground below, never knowing what hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night turned into a silent killing field. One by one, the sentries dropped, none of them living long enough to realize they were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metallic smell of blood drifted far on the night breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had cleared out all the guards in front of them pretty quickly, but there was still no word from Jonah, who'd gone to check the left flank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the situation up ahead?" Quentin asked, his eyes hopeful as he looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All clear," Alexander replied with a cool smile. "There's nobody left breathing up there. We're good to move forward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! I knew I could count on you!" Quentin clapped his hands together, clearly pumped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona's eyes lit up as she stared at Alexander, practically hanging on his every move with that starry-eyed look of hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team waited around for a while longer, but there was still no sign of Jonah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's taking him so long? You think something went wrong?" Quentin was starting to get antsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't say a word. He just closed his eyes to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew they'd be in for one hell of a fight once they got into Sakra Society's hideout, and he needed to stay sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Jonah came jogging back from the left side, drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't moving nearly as smoothly as before, breathing hard with his massive </span><span>sword</span><span> </span><span>dripping blood onto the ground through its grooves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been wearing a pretty satisfied grin until he spotted Alexander&mdash;then his face fell. Clearly, he'd been hoping to beat Alexander back, but no such luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, people, let's roll!" Quentin threw his hand forward. "We're storming their base. Anyone who resists&mdash;take them out. No mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole team sprang into action, making a beeline for the secret entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sakra Society had picked a sweet spot for their hideout&mdash;tucked away in a cave halfway up the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ilona, Jonah, each of you take a squad and hit them from the sides," Quentin barked out orders. "We'll punch through the front. Time to box these bastards in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah gave a quick nod, and he and Ilona each took command of their squads before heading out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone else, stay sharp and follow my lead. Let's move!" Quentin ordered as he led the remaining troops in a fierce charge toward the nearby base entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dead of night erupted into chaos as gunfire and battle cries shattered the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike team's surprise attack caught the Sakra Society completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their advantage was overwhelming&mdash;fifty metahumans against a base staffed mostly with regular personnel. It wasn't even going to be a fair fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The timing couldn't have been better. Most of the base's staff were just stumbling out of their beds, still groggy and disoriented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Alexander in the mix&mdash;that walking nightmare&mdash;no one stood a chance of </span><span>lasting more than a few seconds against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's team stormed the facility, breaking into smaller combat units that swept through the maze of corridors. They systematically cleared each section, pushing steadily toward the heart of the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team's silenced weapons made quick, quiet work of any resistance. Bodies of Sakra Society members hit the floor one after another, leaving trails of blood in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams echoed through the halls as panic spread like wildfire throughout the compound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, the strike team had secured half the facility, leaving over a hundred casualties in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their momentum only grew stronger. With captured personnel leading the way, they carved a path straight toward the command center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, blaring alarms ripped through the entire base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dares to attack us? They must have a death wish," a middle-aged man in a green uniform roared from the command center, his face twisted with rage.</span></p></div>
