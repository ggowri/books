        <h1>Chapter 3 Vice President</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather pondered for a moment, then suddenly laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting... Alexander might just surprise us all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He issued another command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell Augustine and Anthony - they can fight all they want, but Ashley isn't just Alexander's kid - she's my only granddaughter. No one is to lay a finger on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Jane's so blind, have Ava Blackburn marry Alexander. She's Saint Group's CEO, and with Alexander as chairman, they can run it together as husband and wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But as Alexander said, his identity must remain secret. Don't tell Ava for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice trembled slightly. She and Ava were now tied to Alexander's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The game was on. The cruel and bloody battle for the Godfather's inheritance had begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode to the hospital cashier, briefcase in hand, ready to pay for Ashley's surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spotted Jane and Ryan whispering about the helicopter fleet that had just landed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still hanging around, Alexander? Can't get over me?" Jane's voice dripped poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off, loser. Try anything with Jane and you're dead meat!" Ryan snarled menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. "Open your damn eyes, Jane! Here's 500 thousand dollars for Ashley's surgery. I'm rich now, bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane gaped at him in disbelief. Alexander snapped open the suitcase and hurled it, money and all, straight at Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>WHAM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cash exploded everywhere, raining down like confetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's hand flew to her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How the hell had this nobody gotten his hands on that kind of money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way he could get a fortune in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What did he do?</span><span> She thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, well, Alexander," Ryan sneered, his voice thick with sarcasm. "How'd you manage to score half a million dollars? Rob a bank? Dealing drugs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being shown up by Alexander in front of Jane was killing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at Ryan like he was already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, I know everything. You planted those drugs to get me fired. I could end your life with a single phone call, but I don't want you to die that easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your precious Hawkins family's worth hundreds of millions, right? Well, I'll make sure the Hawkins family goes bankrupt. I'll make you taste the bitterness of losing everything and let you die struggling in pain and regret! Only then will I be satisfied!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spitting out those harsh words, Alexander stormed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was dumbfounded, entirely overwhelmed by Alexander's domineering aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's so...different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Where did he get half a million dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Had he been hiding his true capabilities all along?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did I make a terrible mistake? Maybe I shouldn't divorce him...</span><span> She thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face paled with regret. It was too much to process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan caught her wavering expression, and he saw through her instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pang of jealousy shot through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced a calm sneer and said, "Jane, don't fall for his act. If he was so powerful, why'd he hit rock bottom? And now he dares threaten me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Jane slowly breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ryan's right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No one could hide that kind of power for a total of five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He must be bluffing.</span><span> She thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane snorted, "Bet he either borrowed the money from his drug buddies or loan sharks. He's hopeless, just like I know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tossed aside her earlier regret and started making out with Ryan right there as if no one else was around...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the ward, Alexander gazed at the unconscious Ashley, guilt and hope warring in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, Ashley, I'll become the Godfather. No one will ever hurt you again!" he vowed, his voice thick with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone who hurt us is going straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled through tears, eyes soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his phone and dialed Alice's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hollister, get the best doctors and security here. I need to ensure Ashley's health and safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, and his voice turned deadly. "And destroy Ryan. Make him lose everything and worse than a beggar. Do it where each citizen of Loscity can watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir. Let me arrange this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a bombshell piece of news rocked Loscity, sending shockwaves through the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In three days, the Saint Group would hold a grand ball and select a vice president in charge of financial investment at the ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes locked on this event, everyone hoping to become the vice president and skyrocket to success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambitious families and individuals were salivating over this golden ticket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after the news, ball invitations were almost impossible to get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and Ryan were also trembling with excitement. They believed it was their </span><span>perfect </span><span>chance to climb the social ladder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Hawkins family partnered with Saint Group, they could snag an invitation to the ball in a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got this, baby!" Jane exclaimed, her eyes sparkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan pumped his fist, brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That vice president position is bound to be mine!" he declared.</span></p></div>
