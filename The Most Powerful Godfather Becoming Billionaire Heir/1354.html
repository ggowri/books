        <h1>Chapter 1354 Shocking the Church</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just defeated a level-four warrior, made millions, received a reward from the King, and became an Earl. No! I am the last Warrior, and I don't belong to this world!" Alexander thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of past events rushed through his mind, and he coughed up blood before losing consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander finally came to, he found himself covered in black dirt and reeking. He quickly called for Clyde to fetch some water for a bath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Settling into a large wooden tub filled with warm water, Alexander savored the comfort of the hot bath. He felt incredibly relaxed and lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure if it was the Spiritual Awakening or something else, but he had somehow grasped the secret of the Golden Body Technique. It probably wouldn't be long before he mastered it completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy technique was truly remarkable&mdash;it could purge impurities from the body. Alexander felt his muscles and bones growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense that emotions could be contagious; it was their very essence that influenced others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When someone was heartbroken, others could pick up on that sorrow; when someone was joyful, that happiness radiated to those around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced down at his left chest. In the past, his golden aura would only manifest during martial arts practice, but now he noticed a faint golden shimmer even in his normal state. Could it be that as his strength increased, it would become even more apparent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, with an iron rod in hand, Alexander arrived at the martial arts field, where Sellers and two young men rushed over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers embraced Alexander and exclaimed, "Alexander, you're incredible! You're a celebrity now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked puzzled. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers feigned disdain and replied, "Come on, stop pretending! I heard you were granted the title of Earl and awarded 100,000 martial virtue points for your bravery in rescuing Princess Isolde."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred thousand martial virtue points?" Alexander was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers blinked in surprise. "Yeah! You didn't know? It shocked the outer courtyard! After all, you just joined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dominion Church had learned of Alexander's heroic act in saving Isolde and vanquishing a level-four warrior from the cult alongside Zain. They rewarded him with an impressive 100,000 martial virtue points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was just pondering how to spend those points on the Marrow-Cleansing Classic. Even though he was still a level-three warrior, he needed to save up for level-four martial arts techniques too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers introduced the two young men, saying, "Alexander, these are my brothers, Enoch and Hogan. They insisted on meeting you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two smiled and bowed. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly returned their greetings, taking a closer look at them. Enoch, Sellers's older brother, was handsome with thick eyebrows, big eyes, and a strong build&mdash;he looked like a true warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hogan was the younger brother, sharing a fair complexion and refined demeanor, though he appeared a bit leaner than Sellers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice called out, "Hey! Isn't this Earl Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius and a few followers approached. "Earl Alexander, Finn came to discuss something important with you a few days ago. What happened? Why hasn't he returned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, "Finn's in his sixties or seventies, and you expect me to babysit him? Are you out of your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Julius's face flushed with anger, and he turned to leave. One of his subordinates whispered, "Mr. Wetherall, should we teach him a lesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius shot him a fierce glare. "Teach him a lesson? How? Finn's still missing, which probably means he's in danger! Besides, Alexander's an Earl now. According to court law, assaulting an official is punishable by exile at the very least."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wetherall, I have a cousin in the outer courtyard of the Dominion Church who was favored by our family when he was young. His name is Rhodes Monroe," the man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhodes Monroe? I've heard he's a prodigy who became a level-four warrior before turning 30. He's ranked 89th on the Martial Arts Ranking of the outer courtyard and is the most likely candidate in the outer courtyard to reach level five. But what does that have to do with me?" Julius replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man continued, "Mr. Wetherall, don't forget that in two months, it will be the Hrodvik New Year&mdash;the annual competition. By then, we can..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius chuckled. "Alright! You can benefit from this afterward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, Sellers, and their group regarded Julius with disdain as he stumbled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to Sellers and asked, "I have a question. I still don't know where my 30-mile fief is. No one from the officials has come to inform me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Enoch burst into laughter. "You have to pay for the land! His Majesty only grants you a fief of three miles."</span></p></div>
