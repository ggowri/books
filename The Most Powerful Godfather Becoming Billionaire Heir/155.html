        <h1>Chapter 155 Conspiracy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get the hell out of here! Don't disturb my aunt while she's trying to rest," Alexander snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, we're leaving right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton growled, slapping Nick across the face, "Can't you hear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick, already battered and bruised, was completely dazed. He never imagined he'd hit rock bottom like this, really stepping on a landmine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to curse Alexander, but fear had tightened his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton and his crew dragged Nick away, leaving him to wallow in his own misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lily sat quietly, tears streaming down her face. She had only one son, and yet he turned out to be such a disappointment. Any mother would feel crushed in her shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Lily, don't be sad. I'll take care of you," Alexander said softly, checking her leg injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some time to recover, her leg was still healing but had improved significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An idea struck Alexander. He should take Lily away to ensure Nick didn't come back to harass her while he was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, he shot a quick message to </span><span>Alice</span><span>, asking her to arrange a villa for Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, </span><span>Alice</span><span> was busy entertaining </span><span>Houtte</span><span> from the Cripples and Mary from the Blood Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile plastered on his face, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> asked, "Ms. Hollister, when can we meet with the chairman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We want to discuss some deeper cooperation. Ms. Blackburn can't make those decisions on her own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice</span><span> flashed a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As soon as the chairman returns to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, I'll definitely let you know. But really, how much deeper can our cooperation get?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're hoping us to share the magic powder formula, I suggest you let that idea go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes revealed that she saw right through </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exchanging glances with Mary, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> sighed in resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They left the Saint Group with frustration hanging heavy in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> frowned and asked, "Do you get the feeling that </span><span>Alice</span><span> is lying to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary stifled a laugh. "She's definitely spinning a yarn. I can't believe you, a man, are so perceptive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression turned serious as she continued, "That chairman is shrouded in mystery; something's definitely off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> frowned deeper. "What the hell are they up to? Are they keeping the chairman under wraps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary scoffed, saying, "Who cares what they're doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as we join forces, we'll get our hands on the magic powder formula."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> nodded vigorously, a sly grin creeping onto his face as he reached for Mary's curvy butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Cripples and the Blood Gang shaking hands, we'll dominate </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Just imagine what we could accomplish together..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His flirtation was abruptly cut short when Mary pressed a silver handgun against his abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your filthy hands off me! If you touch me again, you'll wish you hadn't been born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's icy tone was laced with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> awkwardly withdrew his hand, though he couldn't shake the memory of her enticing curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary tapped the barrel of the gun against </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The magic powder formula is worth a fortune. You guys from the Cripples can take the lead, and our Blood Gang will back you up. Once we strike a deal, we'll split it sixty-forty&mdash;our way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span>, hearing that his side would get the larger cut, dropped his reservations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then said, "But is Alexander really the one behind the magic powder?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've gone through every scrap of information about Alexander&mdash;from his marriage into the Fairfax family to his sudden rise. It's like he just popped up out of nowhere, becoming a big deal overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget, Joseph's death and the fire that killed Sebastian and his son? All of it ties back to Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's brow furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's strange. This guy was a nobody for five years, then suddenly he's a powerhouse. There's definitely something fishy going on. Do you think it has anything to do with that mysterious chairman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their high-ranking positions in their respective gangs, both were baffled by Alexander's rapid transformation, finding it hard to believe such a peculiar character even existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> snorted in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can't figure it out, then don't bother. When I get my hands on him, he'll sing like a canary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People from the Cripples never die in vain, and especially not someone like Joseph&mdash;he was our </span><span>Loscity</span><span> chapter leader. If we don't avenge him, how are we supposed to hold our ground in the future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The funny thing is, the Saint Group actually thinks we're in some genuine alliance with them."</span></p></div>
