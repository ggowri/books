        <h1>Chapter 432 The Lightsaber Core</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia gazed fearfully at the ominous presence before her. It had been over an hour, and there was no sign of it letting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, how are you getting stronger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia felt a mix of shyness and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't done yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He settled onto the couch, motioning for Rosalia to sit on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" she gasped, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted not letting Charlize take over for a bit longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was overwhelming. Rosalia was shaken like a knight on a horse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was nearly in tears, the depth of it all nearly too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pleasure mixed with a hint of pain coursed through her, and she slumped against Alexander, lost in a wave of sensations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let him hold her butt, and waves of tingling pleasure filled her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, the experience became more intense. The rhythm continued, and she felt herself spinning in a dizzying dance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander couldn't hold back either, a wave of indescribable joy washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander embraced her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Rosalia murmured, overwhelmed by the heat surrounding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I truly admire your strength..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She breathed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you admire it, then we can continue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, he hugged her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please! I need a break... I really can't take anymore. If it weren't for Charlize, I'd be in trouble..." she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed as she stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She staggered slightly, feeling the lingering effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you don't want to continue?" Alexander asked playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia shot him an exasperated look. "Go find Charlize if you want more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still want more?" He reached toward Charlize, who was visibly nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not right now, please!" Charlize exclaimed, waving her hands frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It&rsquo;s too intense! I need to rest&mdash;I feel like I might burst!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said this, she spread her snow-white thighs and took a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, there was some obvious redness and swelling, and there was still a faint stickiness left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just make sure you're both satisfied; I wouldn't want anyone to think I'm playing favorites," Alexander said, signaling for them to help him tidy up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That evening, he told them they could rest while he kept watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two girls were exhausted and left hand in hand, ready for a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, felt invigorated. His Force, once depleted, surged back to life and enhanced further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists excitedly and felt full of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out the top-quality yellow gemstone and got the carving knife ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would be a crucial night for the forming of the Energy Convergence Matrix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>.....</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night passed, and as dawn broke, Alexander opened his eyes, a sharp focus illuminating his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force he had spent was fully restored. If it weren't for his fear of being controlled by desire and becoming a Corrupted Warrior, he would have sought out beautiful women to regain his strength instead of meditating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his desk lay a top-tier yellow gemstone, its surface alive with a dance of </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all one hundred-eight patterns successfully inscribed, he had completed the energy core for his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elated, he knew that with this core, he could finally forge his own weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the former high-quality yellow gemstone with the magic circle, it would serve as a protective talisman, and he had made it a necklace for Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to craft another gemstone for his daughter, ensuring she was safeguarded as well.</span></p></div>
