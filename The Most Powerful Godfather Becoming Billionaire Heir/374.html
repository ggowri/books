        <h1>Chapter 374 Get Out</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last two men tried to fight back, but Alexander twisted their necks in one quick motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their spines broke, and they fell hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William knelt on one knee before Alexander, respectfully saying, "Boss, the </span><span>secretary's only unconscious, and Ms. Blackburn is still safe inside. That's why I didn't intervene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved indifferently. "Got it. Leave this to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William finally exhaled in relief, retreating into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a mere rebuke from Alexander, William had broken into a cold sweat, his respect for Alexander's power growing even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved silently toward the door, as quiet as a falling leaf, using his All-seeing Eyes to peer inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw Ava, dressed in a fitted black suit that emphasized her curves and gave her a strikingly professional, yet seductive appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bernard, get out of here right now!" Ava </span><span>yelled,</span><span> her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, red-faced and heaving with anger, pointed furiously at the middle-aged man in a suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard smirked, and his expression sly. "Ms. Blackburn, my feelings for you are genuine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son Byron is about to marry your friend, Rebecca. Once the Hansen family joins with the Clifford family, adding the Saint Group to the mix would be a brilliant move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava wanted nothing more than to slap him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! Don't you know the Godfather is backing the Saint Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard let out a dismissive scoff, saying, "Ms. Blackburn, the Clifford family, has secured the support of the Red Umbrella Group and Satan. That old man behind you is no threat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava slammed her hand on the desk, shouting, "If you don't get out right now, I'll call for help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Ms. Blackburn, you're infatuated with that worthless leech Alexander. Aren't you afraid I'll just have him taken out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In what way am I worse than him? He's not even the creator of the magic powder; you just handed over the Saint Group's formula to him. Am I right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Bernard stepped closer to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava backed up slowly, snapping, "Stop talking nonsense! What do you think you're doing? This is the Saint Group; don't think you can do whatever you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard licked his lips, his desire flaming uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, your people can't get in here; I've already secured the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop pretending. You're obviously desperate if you've settled for a loser like Alexander. I know he's good in bed, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, I'm even better. Come here, let me show you what I've got!" Bernard sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard's face twisted into a wicked smile as he began unbuckling his belt, intending to expose himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're insane! Get out now, or I'll shoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly pulled a small silver pistol from her drawer, aiming it at Bernard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bernard flinched, then waved his hands in retreat, saying, "Alright, alright, don't </span><span>shoot. I'm leaving, I'm leaving..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around, appearing as though he was about to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Ava sighed in relief, Bernard pounced on her like a wolf, pinning her to the desk, kissing and groping her wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her shock, Ava's gun was knocked from her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! Get off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava struggled desperately, screaming for help, when suddenly Bernard let out a pained cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had seized Bernard by the neck, lifting him off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow! Help... let go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw him across the room, where he landed painfully on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're back!?" Ava cried, overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw herself into his arms, her eyes glistening with tears, full of relief and emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shut the door behind him, locking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Not in the office..." Ava protested, grabbing his roaming hands,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shyly grabbed Alexander's wandering hand, her cheeks flushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she longed for Alexander, this was still the office, and she didn't want to become the subject of office gossip if anyone saw them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was unfazed; he pressed her down onto the chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a soft moan, her body melting under his touch, unable to resist him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung to him, her head against his chest, sighing softly in pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at him, feeling utterly captivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was incredibly strong; no wonder he always made her feel like she was in heaven.</span></p></div>
