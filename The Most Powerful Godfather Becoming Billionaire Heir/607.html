        <h1>Chapter 607 A Mountain of Corpses</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slaughter never stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Augusta moved like tireless machines, relentlessly cutting down the lives of the Morris family at every turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the outskirts of the estate, the dying screams of those trying to flee echoed sporadically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more than twenty men Augusta had brought with him had set up a crossfire, and anyone attempting to escape met the cold precision of a sniper's bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their marksmanship was impeccable&mdash;each shot found its mark, dropping the fleeing enemies one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stench of blood and death hung heavy in the air, a gruesome mountain of bodies piling up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick, as the head of the family, felt his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched his family members fall one after another, his fury was reaching its peak. But Frederick had hesitated, still wary of Alexander's true capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Morris family had suffered heavy losses, and Frederick could no longer contain his rage. The only thought in his mind was that Alexander had to die to protect the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're dead!" Frederick growled, stomping his foot to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force propelled him forward like a bolt of lightning, shooting toward Alexander with incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident&mdash;certain, even&mdash;that his swordsmanship would be enough to take down Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, it is a struggle between losers." Felix sneered, a twisted smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had waited a long time for this moment, and soon, he would reap the rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was Frederick's defeat or Alexander's death, it didn't matter. Either way, it would fuel his rise to greater power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A silvery sword light shot toward Alexander, aimed directly at his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the sharp tip of the sword was upon him. The cold blade was so close that Alexander could feel the chill against his skin, his hair standing on end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's expression didn't change. He had seen it coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, watch out!" Augusta shouted, rushing forward and slashing at the incoming sword light with his steel blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a snap, Augusta's blade broke in an instant, half of it clattering to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's sword light, undeterred, veered slightly off course but continued its deadly path, now aimed at Alexander's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually waved his hand, and his Lightsaber appeared in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another snap, the sword light vanished, and a silver fragment of the broken blade fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched as Frederick retreated, a silent admiration forming in his mind. "Frederick's swordsmanship is indeed impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Frederick, at that moment, was more shocked than ever. His full-powered strike had been effortlessly neutralized, and his prized sword&mdash;a blade forged through countless trials&mdash;had been cut down as if it were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the broken remnant, Frederick stood more than thirty feet away from Alexander, his expression shifting uncertainly. He didn't make another move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell over the scene. Everyone's eyes were locked on Alexander and Frederick, neither daring to make the next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Augusta paused his rampage, standing guard behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad. Alexander is stronger than I thought." Frederick's mind raced, a fine sheen of cold sweat forming on his back. His body tensed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was tense&mdash;Alexander and Frederick were in a standoff while Augusta faced a crowd of Morris family members, all of them surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes and gave a cold laugh. "Your swordsmanship is impressive, but it's still not enough to match mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth, Alexander! You'll pay for this," Frederick snarled, eyes locked on his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There would be no negotiation, no retreat. It was a fight to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, attack! I'll reward the one who kills Alexander with 100 million dollars!" Frederick shouted, offering a massive bounty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family members went wild, their morale skyrocketing as they surged toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slaughter these ants!" Alexander ordered Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Augusta's machete appeared before one of the Morris family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With lightning speed, it sliced through the man's neck, and blood gushed forth like a fountain. His head flew up, and the lifeless body crashed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta wielded the machete with such dexterity that it seemed to dance, leaving a trail of blood in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was punctuated by the dull thuds of gunfire, each shot signaling another attack from Augusta's loyal followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aerial assault from the dozens of snipers perched high above was devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the Morris family's overwhelming numbers, they were being decimated by Augusta, who couldn't be approached, let alone draw near to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surged forward like waves, desperately trying to reach Alexander, but were </span><span>repeatedly crushed by Augusta, the unyielding boulder standing firm against the tide.</span></p></div>
