        <h1>Chapter 45 Submission</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander remained expressionless, not sparing Betty a glance. He casually reached for the cigarettes and lighter on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Click!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A blue flame flickered to life, casting an eerie glow on his silver mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander plucked a cigarette from the pack and lit it, taking a deep drag before exhaling slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The long stream of smoke snaked out like a dragon, wafting into Betty's pretty face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing? Let me go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty was starting to panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This man was impossible to read. He had a unique allure and presence about him, somehow seeming even more dangerous than the two kidnappers from earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're beautiful, with a great figure. It'd be a real shame if you died just like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's sudden words, paired with the bone-chilling coldness emanating from his silver mask, sent a shiver down Betty's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm Betty Rowe, the General Manager of the Brilliant Group's Loscity branch. Let me go, and I'll give you a million dollars on the spot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And I'll owe you a favor. You can come to me if you encounter any difficulties in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty laid out her offer with dead seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A million dollars, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sauntered over to Betty, tilting her chin up with his finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bet... A million dollars... I'm a woman of my word..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty responded with certainty, struggling to meet Alexander's piercing gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want your loyalty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's tone brooked no argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty's position as manager of the Loscity branch meant she had Guzman's complete trust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's ambitions went beyond mere revenge. He aimed to double the Saint Group's market value within a year, a goal easily achievable by swallowing up the Brilliant Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her role as a mole within the Brilliant Group would prove invaluable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? You... you creep!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty was terrified. She'd escaped her kidnappers only to fall into the clutches of a pervert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was dumbfounded. Betty had the wrong idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to recruit Betty to plant a seed within the Brilliant Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander silent, Betty felt increasingly sure that a terrifying murderous intent was accumulating behind that silver mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, don't kill me! If you must fuck me, I can agree to it once, but only once..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty stammered, her tone pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but laugh and cry at her words. After a moment, he casually broke the ropes binding Betty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now free, Betty blushed and awkwardly covered her chest with her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her dress was mainly torn, exposing nearly all of her upper body, even snapping one side of her bra's strap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite her best efforts to cover herself, only the areolas and a small part of her breasts were hidden; the rest trembled with her movements, creating waves of motion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Relax your mind, and obey me," Alexander commanded coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty's willpower was certainly no match for William's; by asking her to relax, Alexander could more easily use The Force to control her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No... I've never done blowjob for a man before..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty's face showed both humiliation and disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander rolled his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want your mouth. Just relax your mind and imagine I'm the person you trust most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty couldn't help but let out a snort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So this mysterious guy was a pervert who liked to play master-servant games. Her gaze toward Alexander filled with contempt and mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was truly annoyed now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said icily, "I'll give you one last chance. Relax your mind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a faint purple light burst forth from those deep eyes behind the silver mask, staring directly into Betty's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if struck by lightning on a clear day, Betty was enveloped by a terrifying, invisible force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power exploded outward, seeming to make the air temperature drop drastically by over ten degrees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though it was midsummer, Betty's body stiffened, and she shivered uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes locked!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betty felt her consciousness lift away, stirred by Alexander's penetrating gaze as if undergoing the most intense hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She clutched her head, feeling dizzy and disoriented. Her mind became a fog, her thoughts growing increasingly muddled...</p></div>
