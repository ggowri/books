        <h1>Chapter 1203 Handle This Case Fairly</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's... it's Mr. Hawthorne..." Christopher's mind went blank as the realization hit him. Even Police Commissioner Oliver showed nothing but respect to Alexander. What chance did he stand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a high-ranking officer in the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Police Department, Christopher knew exactly how much influence Alexander wielded. He was the shadow ruler of the Ultimate Alliance, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city's most powerful families, including the Kaylon, followed Alexander's every command without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher didn't need anyone to spell it out for him. One word from Alexander could shake </span><span>Loscity</span><span> to its foundations. If the Rhodes family couldn't afford to cross him, Christopher certainly couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger on Christopher's face melted away like ice under a blowtorch, vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He double-checked just to be sure, but there was no mistake. The man standing before him was definitely Alexander Hawthorne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne! What a pleasure! I had no idea you'd be attending the music festival today. It's such an honor to meet you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher scurried over to </span><span>Alexander,</span><span> head bowed low as he extended both hands for a handshake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know who I am?" Alexander's face remained expressionless as he asked the question, leaving Christopher's outstretched hands hanging awkwardly in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I know you. Everyone in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> knows who you are, Mr. Hawthorne," Christopher said with an ingratiating smile, nodding repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in confusion as Christopher's demeanor transformed from aggressive to deferential the </span><span>moment</span><span> he recognized Alexander. The sudden change left everyone wondering what was really going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Christopher, what the hell?" Sienna demanded furiously. "Why aren't you arresting him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today had turned into a complete nightmare for her. What should have been a simple matter of teaching a woman and child a lesson had spiraled completely out of control. Christopher was supposed to be her backup!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Christopher, what are you waiting for?" Sienna pressed. "He's a murderer. He needs to face justice! Arrest him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher couldn't even find words to respond. Sure, he had connections with the Rhodes family elders, but there was no way he'd risk crossing Alexander for their sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're calling me a murderer?" Alexander's voice cut through the tension. "When you just tried to have my daughter killed in front of hundreds of witnesses? Anyone here can tell you exactly what happened. Just ask them." He gestured to the massive crowd below the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stepped forward. "You can gather all the evidence right here. Sienna tried to have someone killed in front of dozens of witnesses. The weapons are right there, and we only acted in self-defense. With all these witnesses and physical evidence, she can't deny what she did!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe the police will handle this case fairly, without any special treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna's face twisted with panic as their words sank in. For once, she was completely speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher's expression shifted rapidly as he processed the situation. He quickly motioned for his officers to begin their investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police officers spread through the crowd, gathering witness statements while others pulled up the stage's security footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One look at Sienna's terrified face told Christopher that Alexander was telling the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reports from his officers kept flowing in, and after reviewing the security footage himself, Christopher's face darkened with each passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to </span><span>Sienna,</span><span> his voice sharp with anger. "What were you thinking, Sienna? This isn't some lawless playground. Having money and connections doesn't mean you can just do whatever you want! You're lucky this didn't end worse for you. Do you even know who Mr. Hawthorne is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One word from him, and it won't just be you&mdash;the entire Rhodes family would be wiped out!" Christopher snapped, his chest heaving with anger as he glared at Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher wanted to scream at her. The Rhodes family might be music industry royalty, but at the end of the day, they were just rich musicians. How could they possibly compare to someone like Alexander? One phone call from him could probably destroy their entire dynasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher's blood boiled as he watched her. He'd always thought Sienna was this sweet, pretty girl who had her act together. He had been wrong about her true colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into shocked whispers. Everyone finally understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who'd just schooled Sienna, wasn't just some random fighter. He was someone with serious connections, the kind that even high-ranking police officials wouldn't dare mess with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, that hot guy is so lowkey! Not only is he a total badass, but he's actually such a big shot that even the Rhodes family can't touch him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what? He looks super familiar. I swear I've seen him somewhere before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement, and more than a few women in the audience were definitely crushing on Alexander now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander had just taken down dozens of attackers like it was nothing. It was the kind of thing they'd only see in action movies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police wrapped up their investigation pretty quickly. Between the witness statements and security camera footage, the evidence was crystal clear&mdash;Sienna had hired thugs to attack Alexander, and he'd acted purely in self-defense.</span></p></div>
