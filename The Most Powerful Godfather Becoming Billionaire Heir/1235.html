        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw these people in black cloaks," the man blurted out. "They were controlling the mutated beasts somehow, directing them to attack us. Though I only caught glimpses of them at dawn, so I can't be completely certain of what I saw."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news hit everyone like a ton of bricks. The idea that someone could control these mutated beasts was a game-changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant this whole mutation crisis wasn't some freak accident</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>someone was pulling the strings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those bastards," Karson muttered. A theory was already forming in his mind. This had the Sakra Society written all over it&mdash;the same group that had caused the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he didn't have solid proof, but this felt too similar to be a coincidence. Last time, they'd targeted humans directly; this time, they were weaponizing animals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the bigger picture, Karson knew they were in deep trouble. Between the beast hive and these mysterious controllers, defending the port seemed like a lost cause. He had a gut feeling their enemies were just building up their forces, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, sweetheart," Karson said, "we could put up a hefty reward for a </span><span>s</span><span>uicide </span><span>s</span><span>quad</span><span>. Get them to drive far out and see if they can lure some of these mutant beasts away. Even pulling away just a portion of them would take a lot of pressure off our </span><span>defenses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah nodded enthusiastically at her father's suggestion. It was a solid plan that could definitely lighten their load if they could find people willing to take on such a risky mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no amount of money would matter if you weren't alive to spend it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly man with graying hair stepped forward. "Mr. Chapman, while the </span><span>s</span><span>uicide </span><span>s</span><span>quad</span><span> idea is good, I think we should also form </span><span>a strike team</span><span>. We could take the fight to these monsters and thin out their numbers before they reach us. That would make our defensive position much stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words caught everyone's attention, and the room filled with excited whispers. The idea made sense, but nobody was exactly jumping at the chance to volunteer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson thought it over for a moment before nodding firmly. "You've got a point," he said. "We can't just sit here playing defense. We should take advantage of the daylight and go on the offensive&mdash;kill what we can and lure away the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got the guns, we've got the vehicles, and we know this terrain like the back of our hands. We can pick them off bit by bit. Hell, we could even set up some kill zones, leading those bastards right into our traps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah found herself agreeing with the strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's exactly what we need. We can't just play defense forever. We've got to take the fight to them, or we won't make it till morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our trucks and guns, we can set up some ambushes, thin out these creatures around us. Once those mystery guys in black get impatient and come at us, we'll give them the fight they're looking for. We just need to hold out long enough for the military backup to arrive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man chimed in, "This plan could actually work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others nodded. "You're right. We're dead either way if we just sit here like sitting ducks. Let's either draw these mutant beasts away or take them out to give us some breathing room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smarter dock workers perked up at this idea. They weren't stupid&mdash;they knew hunkering down indefinitely was just another way to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah's eyes lit up as another idea struck her. "Dad, we could get some people digging tunnels. We can bury some shipping containers underground as our backup plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the walls don't hold, we retreat into the tunnels. As long as we stock them with enough food and water, we could hold out for quite a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that's what I'm talking about!" Karson clapped his hands in approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help glancing toward the harbor, shaking his head at the waste of it all. When everything went to hell, panic had led to that massive explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blast had taken out the fuel tanks, which then destroyed most of the ships at the dock. They were left with barely any vessels that could still float.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell Kayce it's urgent," Karson added. "Ask if they can get even one boat running&mdash;just enough to get us out of the harbor. We need a backup plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah responded with a determined nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harbor's only salvageable cruise ship had engine damage. The repair crew had originally estimated three days for fixes, but they'd only had one day so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Norah would pass along the message, she wasn't getting her hopes up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their strategy set, everyone split up to handle their assignments.</span></p></div>
