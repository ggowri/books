        <h1>Chapter 1057 Chase Wanted Rosalia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was Chase. He widened his eagle-like eyes, looking very sharp and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were a dozen bruisers beside him, each with a fierce expression. All kinds of tattoos and ferocious scars could be seen on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A robust fellow walked up to Chase and whispered, "Chase, leave it to us. We'll kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, do you think you are stronger than Gore? Get lost, idiot!" Chase sneered and pushed the man away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man stepped aside and stopped speaking. The people around were silent, and several half-naked&nbsp;women were scared to hide in the corner. They were all the members of the Obsidian Gang, knowing that Chase</span><span> was</span><span> Ariella</span><span>'s deadly enemy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase had gotten the Obsidian Gang under control. To some extent, Ariella was no match for Chase at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gore was the second in command in the Obsidian Gang with many followers. However, he was dragged back by Rosalia, covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Chase and Ariella were bound to have a final fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella deliberately walked behind Alexander. Looking at Chase's homicidal appearance and those fierce men around him, Ariella felt a surge of rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said calmly, "If you don't want to suffer too much pain, hand over the Obsidian Gang now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, you brat! Are you scaring me? You dragged Gore here. Do you think I will be afraid of you?" Chase sneered contemptuously. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, </span><span>Chase</span><span> pulled up a woman next to him, held her in his arms, kissed and touched her. At the same time, he looked at Alexander and Ariella with provocative eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, and then Rosalia threw Gore, who was in a coma, in front of Chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase was startled, growling, "</span><span>How </span><span>dare </span><span>you</span><span> ask me to hand over the Obsidian Gang</span><span>! </span><span>Even Ariella's father had never been so arrogant in front of me</span><span>!</span><span>" Chase pointed to Ariella, looking very arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes, revealing his </span><span>killing intention</span><span>. Before he made a move, two </span><span>punks</span><span> shouted and rushed towards him, wanting to punch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked young and handsome, making people think that he was a pushover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the two </span><span>punks</span><span> approached Alexander, Rosalia punched and slapped them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two burly men fell and rolled on the ground in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the people around rushed over with weapons in their hands, just waiting for Chase to give the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chase didn't give any order but stared at Rosalia's </span><span>big boobs</span><span> with eyes full of lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase smiled, "Well done, </span><span>little </span><span>beauty</span><span>! </span><span>It </span><span>was you who </span><span>defeated Gore</span><span>, right? </span><span>What's your relationship with Ariella?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia glanced at Chase with disdain, not bothering to reply to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase chuckled, "</span><span>Chick</span><span>, stay with me. I can meet any requirement of you, let you be the hostess of the Obsidian Gang, and give you 10</span><span>0,000</span><span> dollars </span><span>per</span><span> month</span><span> as allowance</span><span>. Think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase took a fancy to Rosalia's strength and beauty</span><span>. </span><span>Rosalia's</span><span> sexy body turned him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase ignored Alexander</span><span>, </span><span>and believed that Rosalia was Ariella's helper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>200,000 </span><span>dollars!" Seeing that Rosalia ignored him, Chase quickly doubled the price and wanted to tempt Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Rosalia didn't even glance at him this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>300,000 </span><span>dollars!" Chase added another 100 thousand dollars. If Rosalia agreed, she could get more than three million dollars a year, which was a bi</span><span>g number of money</span><span> for ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>thugs</span><span> around stared at Rosalia with different expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia stood beside Alexander respectfully and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a playful expression, just like watching a fool's acting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella stood there with mixed feelings. She knew very well that Alexander was </span><span>stronger than </span><span>Rosalia</span><span>. </span><span>Chase was </span><span>so</span><span> stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>500,000 </span><span>dollars!" Chase raised the price loudly again and stared at Rosalia with intense lust in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia sneered contemptuously and ignored him</span><span> again</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>60</span><span>0,000 </span><span>dollars! </span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"700,000 </span><span>dollars!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>80</span><span>0,000 </span><span>dollars!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>900</span><span>,000 </span><span>dollars!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>One million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To win Rosalia over, Chase kept raising the price with </span><span>exciting look</span><span>.</span></p></div>
