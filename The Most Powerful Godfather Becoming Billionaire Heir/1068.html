        <h1>Chapter 1068 Accident</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, Alexander took the Obsidian Gang to nearby streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Aetheris Street, the surrounding areas all belonged to the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their feud, Alexander wouldn't be lenient with the Mafia. Since they conspired with Sakra Society and were impacted, he might as well take this good opportunity to take over their territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Needless to say, the surrounding blocks were soon taken over by the Obsidian Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager of the Mafia in Lumiria was miserably executed on the street with half of his head missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella easily regained her control of the Obsidian Gang, and her power was enhanced by this strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander and Rosalia went to the airport to get back to Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred members of the Obsidian Gang dressed in the same uniform, following Ariella and some senior leaders of the gang, stood in line to see them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goodbye. Call me if you need anything." Alexander waved at Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, can't you stay here a few more days?" With red eyes, Ariella was reluctant to let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ariella's eyes with deep affection for Alexander, Rosalia sighed in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she, along with other people, wisely walked away to leave them some space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with a smile, "I really have to go. Just take care of yourself. I hope everything will go well for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forcing a smile, she suddenly embraced him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, as tears welled up in Ariella's eyes, Alexander said with a sigh, "Don't worry. Lumiria is close to Loscity. I'll come here to see you when I have time. Let's keep in touch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Alexander resolutely turned around and walked towards the boarding gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia also smiled at Ariella and followed Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella's shoulders trembled as she lowered her head and wept silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a legend spread in Lumiria that Ariella got protection from a mysterious, capable man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they had sex, Ariella retook charge of the Obsidian Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, the Obsidian Gang launched an attack to expand its territory three times more than before, thus becoming the top gang in Lumiria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the identity of that man behind the curtain, everyone had their own guesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the whole Obsidian Gang obeyed Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also gained so much from his trip to Lumiria; he not only saved Hazel but also destroyed Cyclops' base in Aetheris Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he also rescued more than thirty women in that hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Alexander was in a pretty good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving at the Loscity Airport, Alexander didn't rush home and told Rosalia to go back first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove to the nursing home where James used to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His room still looked exactly the same as before. When Alexander stepped in, he felt sentimental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he finally became an Advanced Warrior. If James had known that, he would have been very delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at this room with a blank mind, Alexander immersed himself in the memory with James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without his help, Alexander wouldn't have achieved what he had now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly felt very empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander left the nursing home and was about to get in the car when he suddenly heard quarrels from not far away. He looked at the place of conflict and saw people dodging in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman dashed, closely followed by seven men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned and didn't interfere in this abrupt mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was never afraid of trouble, but meddling in others' affairs was not his thing. After all, maybe that woman messed with those people in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, that woman glimpsed at Alexander and seemed to come up with an idea to get out of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, help me! They are all bad guys. Help me</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually hugged Alexander and asked for his help as if he was her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a little pissed off and glared at her since he was used as a shield for a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could explain, those hefty men surrounded Alexander and the woman aggressively.</span></p></div>
