        <h1>Chapter 1108 Scavenging for the Elixirs</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale and Jaden looked at Alexander earnestly, hoping he had a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, if you can save my father, we, the Lawson family, will pay any price. We'll do whatever it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale pleaded, his voice shaking slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't a man without foresight. With the situation spiraling out of control, Gavin, as the head of the Lawson family, absolutely couldn't afford to be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's eyes welled up with tears as she stared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment before nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have a plan that might wake Sir Lawson up, but it comes with some risk and will require a lot of resources."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale leaned forward anxiously, still not fully understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the plan? Whatever it costs, just tell me. We can afford it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander shook his head. "It's not about money. What I need is one hundred power elixirs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred power elixirs? That's a lot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale furrowed his brow immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, are you planning to turn my father into a metahuman? But even then, one hundred elixirs wouldn't be necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As far as I know, the side effects of power elixirs are severe. There's a high chance they'll fail&mdash;either they turn into idiots or die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden also frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think power elixirs grow on trees? You can't just buy as many as you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Immortality Serums turn living people into zombies. Gavin's poisoning isn't severe, but I've managed to keep him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But to completely remove the danger and wake him up, the only way is for Gavin to become a metahuman. Only then can he use his power to fight off the remaining toxins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The reason I need one hundred power elixirs is because I have a method to refine them, removing the side effects and allowing Gavin to safely gain power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! You can really do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Gale and Jaden were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale's face alternated between red and pale, and his chest rose and fell rapidly, clearly agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, his voice harsh, "The major powers are all developing their own metahuman armies. Even Avalora, as strong as it is, can only produce about a thousand power elixirs a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred... that's just too many!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale looked troubled, muttering to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stayed silent for a moment, wondering if he had overestimated his ability to convince them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After discovering traces of Immortality Serum in Gavin's system, he realized that Yinson was behind the poisoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leaders from various countries were heavily guarded, and their food and drink were closely monitored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So Yinson must have weakened the potency of the elixir and sneaked it into Gavin's food and water to poison him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Gavin wouldn't have suffered just a stroke&mdash;he would've either become a living dead or turned into a full zombie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's plan was to use the Lawson family's influence to raid Avalora's official stock of power elixirs, boosting his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Ultimate Alliance, including Treasure Island and Devil Island, already had hundreds of metahuman operatives, but even that wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But power elixirs were rare. Even though Alexander had obtained a batch from Felix, it had already been used up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group had been taken over by the military, and even if he paid a huge price, getting a large quantity of power elixirs was almost impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But helping Gavin recover? This was the perfect opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Jaden pulled Gale aside, and they whispered to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, let's do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale suddenly clapped his hands in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ahem..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned back to Alexander, taking his hand and flashing a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, we're planning to get three hundred power elixirs. You need to refine three with no side effects so that my dad and the two of us brothers can all gain power. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eye twitched, and he almost couldn't hold back a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three hundred?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Gale, clearly surprised by the number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alexander hadn't responded right away, Jaden hurried over to flatter him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, with chaos looming, we're not strong enough, so we really need your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's gaze shifted, and he nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine. If you can get me three hundred power elixirs, I'll refine three with no side effects for you. No matter the cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I guarantee all of you will become metahumans with power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? That's incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale burst into a joyful laugh and slapped Alexander on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm so glad you're going to be my son-in-law!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace immediately blushed, feeling a little shy as she leaned against Alexander.</span></p></div>
