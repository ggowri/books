        <h1>Chapter 549 Future Star</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Is he really Mr. Rossetti's pupil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was ecstatic and thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Invite him in! No. I'd better invite him in myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without casting a glance at Alexander, Orlando pivoted around and rushed outside with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was extremely excited about the arrival of such a big shot, in contrast to his contemptuous attitude towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. It seemed that there was a change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Orlando and his men came back, surrounding a young man, Clay Burch, in his twenties with enthusiasm.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the master who had spied on Nancy and Alexander before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was dressed in a suit of branded casual clothes, his expression was lustful, and his shoes were covered in mud. He looked like an annoying country bumpkin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando shook with excitement and expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Burch, to my surprise, you are the future star of the City of Sorcery at such a young age. You must have received the true teachings of Mr. Rossetti!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please help, Mr. Burch. As long as Elaina can recover, I will satisfy any request you make!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was proud. As his eyes swept over Alexander, he sneered, "Why is he here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Burch, this young man is also here to treat Elaina," Orlando hurriedly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay snorted, "Can he cure Ms. Elaina Gomez? He is a liar. Kick him out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been furious at the sight of Alexander and Nancy together, so now, he seized the opportunity to make things difficult for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was still hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay mocked, "Mr. Gomez, you are smart. How could you be easily deceived?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Burch, you are right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando felt embarrassed and glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so concerned that he wanted to try every possible means to save Elaina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Clay, the future star of the City of Sorcery, Orlando would definitely not believe in a guy like Alexander, who had unknown origins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay shouted icily, "Hurry up and get him out of here. Do not let him interfere with my treatment of Ms. Elaina Gomez. Such a charlatan is here to do more harm than good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll let him go right away," Orlando agreed respectfully. Then, he waved his hand at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You heard it, too. Leave now. You should thank Mr. Burch for coming in time. Otherwise, I will break your legs or even worse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't panic and said calmly, "Orlando, your daughter was bewitched, and Clay was behind it. Aren't you afraid of an accident by allowing someone who harmed your daughter to treat her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His statement shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Orlando laughed angrily, assuming that Alexander was too arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Alexander and yelled, "Come on, get this liar out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Clay suddenly stopped the bodyguards who were rushing forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Alexander with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you slander me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandfather is the great elder of the City of Sorcery. I learned witchcraft and witch doctoring from him at the age of four, helped people solve various difficult problems at ten, and became a gray wizard at eighteen. Now, I have been promoted to a dark wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I have practiced martial arts for twenty years. Even if I am locked up with a tiger, the tiger will die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My witchcraft and martial arts have both reached a high level. Among the younger generation, no one in the world can outshine me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay, full of confidence, raised his head proudly while speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando and his men were excited and in great awe of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was undoubtedly a genius. Since he was good at witchcraft and martial arts, no one could be a match for him. He was indeed the future star of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you slander me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to die, apologize to me, get out of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, and stay away from Nancy, or I will destroy you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay glared at Alexander fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept smiling, as if listening to a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? </span><span>So</span><span> you're the bastard who is haunting Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given your temperament and your behavior, you are indeed not likable. Despite your skills, you are still a country bumpkin. No wonder Nancy looks down on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words immediately irritated Clay.</span></p></div>
