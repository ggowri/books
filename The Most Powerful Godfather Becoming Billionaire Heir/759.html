        <h1>Chapter 759 Surveillance Footage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca playfully hit his chest twice, pouting, "You said you were going to me, but I didn't see you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was feeling down and wanted to relax. He carried her straight into one of the rooms in the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, like a lazy little kitten, lay obediently in Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander removed her outer clothes, laid her on the bed, and lifted her skirt to touch it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So wet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's inner thighs were damp with moisture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled as he removed her black stockings, revealing her slender, beautiful legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, who had been writhing her buttocks, suddenly sat up and fumbled with Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to unfasten his belt and zipper but was so anxious her hands were shaking, and she couldn't succeed for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! What's going on? Why can't I unfasten it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was so flustered her face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh and quickly removed his pants himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Are you afraid of the dragon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's eyes brightened. She took him into her mouth, skillfully moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair fluttered with her movements, and saliva dripped from her sexy lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander panted contentedly. When Rebecca had given herself to him for the first time, her movements were incredibly awkward. Now, she was finally very skilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training a shy, inexperienced girl into a willing participant under one's command was something any man would look forward to. That was a highly satisfying feeling of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's anxious expression was really enticing. Alexander felt it was time to satisfy her, and he pushed Rebecca down onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, come on. I want you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca panted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed her hands, raised them above her head, and pressed down on her body, kissing her passionately while his right hand kneaded and twisted her plump body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's body trembled violently as if electrified, her buttocks wildly twisting and her slender waist eagerly pushing against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Honey, give it to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kissing and touching were not enough for Rebecca. They only brought her thirst to a peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, lifted her buttocks, and penetrated her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca felt as if her body was being pierced through, and she seemed to split apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair was disheveled, her facial expression extremely coquettish as she cried out, "Honey... Slow down. I'm coming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leisurely enjoyed himself for a while, then suddenly heard a strange noise from the master bedroom upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out a remote control, turned on the TV screen, and switched the surveillance footage from the master bedroom to the TV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image showed two beautiful women entwined, caressing each other, emitting waves of moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, with her eyes closed, thought Alexander was playing an erotic movie to spice things up when she heard the sounds from the TV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ava's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what are you doing... Why are you doing this? When Alexander comes back, I'm going to tell him you bullied me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn coaxed, "Oh, Ava, I'm training you, or you won't be able to withstand Alexander. He's going to have more and more women around him. It's not a good thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca listened clearly, curious about what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly opened her eyes and looked at the TV screen, her writhing body freezing and her erotic cries ceasing abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Rebecca unable to believe her eyes, but even Alexander found the scene surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Lynn were naked on the large bed, both using a long electric toy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The toy was connected to the bodies of Ava and Lynn at both ends. Any movement of their waists and buttocks would cause the toy to rotate and thrust incessantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca finally regained her senses and said in a daze, "Oh my god. Lynn is training Ava. All for you, you lecher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander enjoyed the enticing images on the TV while pinching Rebecca's breasts, rubbing them vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's initially stiff body began to move again, her full hips swaying actively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up Rebecca and strode towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca immediately panicked and said shyly, "What are you doing? I don't want to go over there. Lynn is there. I'm embarrassed..."</span></p></div>
