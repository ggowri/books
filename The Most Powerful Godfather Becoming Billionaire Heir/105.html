        <h1>Chapter 105 Discrimination</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Deal!" Orion replied without hesitation, a smug smile lighting up his face, convinced of his victory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's expression soured. While she trusted Alexander, this whole bet situation felt a bit shaky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lingering thought of what might happen if they lost weighed heavily on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander opened his mouth to reassure her, Ava turned away in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, are you really willing to gamble on our relationship? I can't believe you would do this to us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caught off guard, Alexander froze, realizing he hadn't considered her feelings at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He desperately wanted to explain, but Ava shot an invitation to Orion instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hansen, let's discuss our collaboration in my office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion beamed, reveling in a sense of triumph as he shot a triumphant glare at Alexander before eagerly following Ava to her office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander wanted to chase after them, but Emma stepped in his way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn specifically said that no outsiders are allowed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frustrated, he could only force a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Orion was about to enter Ava's office, he turned back to Alexander and called out, "You've already lost! I'll make sure to tell Mr. Gellar all about your ridiculous claims tomorrow. With his connections, I can't wait to see how you'll handle the fallout!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander opened his mouth to retort but found himself speechless. He was hit by Ava's sudden move and felt an unsettling knot of jealousy form in his stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca crossed her arms defiantly, a smug grin spreading across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know what they say about shooting yourself in the foot, Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shot her a glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She continued, reveling in her own superiority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Orion is like the sun, and you're just a speck of dust here on earth. The difference in our family backgrounds is staggering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Our ancestors laid the foundation for the Hansen family in Loscity two hundred years ago, and since then, we've built an empire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We've sacrificed lives and spilled blood to grow our family wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here we are today, one of Loscity's four great families with assets in the billions!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My cousin Orion has the honor of being born into this legacy&mdash;something someone like you, a mere commoner, could never understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca boasted, her voice dripping with pride and condescension, causing even Emma to stare, astonished and envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander didn't dispute what she said. It was commendable what families like the Hansen family had achieved&mdash;built through generations of hard work and determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their spirit was respectable in its own right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Rebecca quickly turned her attention back to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're just a lucky commoner, leveraging Ava's affection. In my eyes, you're nothing but a decent brawler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And let's not kid ourselves. If you had any semblance of courage, your ex-wife wouldn't have walked all over you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pointed out the window to a fly buzzing outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"See that? That's you&mdash;a small, insignificant fly. Sure, you might be a bit stronger than the average one, but you're still just a fly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really believe you deserve Ava? Do you think you're worthy of competing with Orion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander prepared to retort, Rebecca grew even more animated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't need to explain yourself. I know why you've been trying to get close to and charm Ava."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a dramatic flourish, she pulled out a check and tossed it disdainfully on the table in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here's 30 million dollars&mdash;an amount you'll never earn in your lifetime. Take this money, get out of Loscity, and don't ever contact Ava again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Rebecca's eyes, Alexander was bound to accept the check.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thirty million was enough for any man to live lavishly, surrounded by pleasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked down at Alexander with a mixture of disdain and a hint of pity, as if he were nothing more than a lesser being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Waiting for him to bend down and pick it up, she leaned forward, her expression oozing superiority along with an undercurrent of scorn.</p></div>
