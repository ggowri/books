        <h1>Chapter 735 Expert Group</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the uplifting news spread, the whole hospital was immediately in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The expert group and rescue team are here, and we are saved. God bless us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear that? There are so many famous experts here. Great! We're really saved..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God bless us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both doctors and patients were excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were in tears, some were jumping around like crazy, and some even fell down and prayed devoutly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had waited for hope in the midst of despair, so of course they were ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The expert group and the rescue team are here. Go check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin waved her hand</span><span> </span><span>and led her subordinates outside at a brisk pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was holding a pizza and looked extremely embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melin, I'm going to make you crouch down, lick my feet, and beg me to forgive you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Melin met Eddy Hale, the hospital director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hale, are we really saved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy's face was also filled with excitement and thrill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we truly have hope of being rescued."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dozens of renowned experts from around the world have formed a medical expert group, and there are also hundreds of rescue teams that have brought hundreds of truckloads of living supplies, so we're sure to be saved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said as she and Melin excitedly ran towards the main entrance of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medics and patients followed behind as they all ran together in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was the only one who looked frustrated, and his previous plan was to get Melin while the plague was breaking out, but it just ended like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed angrily, but he hurriedly followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze wanted to see if this expert group could help Loscity get rid of the threat from the plague or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fleet of cars sped past, with police cars and military vehicles in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the cars were parked on the avenue in front of the hospital, winding into the distance like a long snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of renowned medical experts came from various countries, so they had to pay attention to the security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of policemen and soldiers were heavily armed to escort the expert group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did they send out the army, but even a few streets in the neighborhood were blocked down. Everyone was only allowed out but not allowed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This plague had already not only severely affected Loscity, but it was tending to spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it affected dozens of states, it was truly going to be havoc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door of the bulletproof car in the middle was opened, and the first person to get out was the governor, Anderson Blunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, the second person to get out of the car was Gideon. After Alexander's treatment, Gideon had obviously recovered, and his energy had recovered quite well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the chief designer of the military's newest research department, Gideon's status was especially valuable, and even the governor treated him with great politeness and respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a sexy and hot beautiful woman with a gorgeous body unexpectedly came down from the third car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was tall, and with her six-inch high heels, her legs looked incomparably long and slender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The close-fitting, white, ultra-thin protective suit wrapped tightly around her body. Her body was perfect and attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the woman was wearing a protective mask, they could still see her large and bright blue eyes, her blonde hair flowing in the wind, and she looked beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quiet at the scene, and all the men were staring at this woman, and many of them swallowed, obviously licking their lips a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman and Melin each had their own style, and it was hard to tell them from each other, but she was more powerful than Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other people coming down from the other cars were dozens of famous medical experts from different countries who were quite old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin pushed Eddy, who finally came to her senses and rushed forward to greet him, her tone filled with excitement and respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Blunt, I didn't expect you to come in person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hale, nice to meet you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson smiled faintly, and the two of them held their hands together through their protective gloves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me introduce her to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson turned to the pretty woman and said, "This is the leader of the expert group, Dr. Elaine Bell, who is the winner of this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine and the world's most renowned expert in infectious diseases from Risun."</span></p></div>
