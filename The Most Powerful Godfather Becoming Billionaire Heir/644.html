        <h1>Chapter 644 Strong Interest</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with a smile, "I appreciate your help. We will stay in the Axe for a few more days. I hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great. You can stay as long as you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa knew that she had made friends with him; all her efforts were not in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the two beauties chatted in delight, talking about something such as clothes, cosmetics, jewelry, etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa could tell that Alice was not only Alexander's secretary but also his lover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, getting along with Alice would be rather important to achieve her goal of recruiting Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alice also wanted to ally with Alyssa to deal with Paxton. Their goals coincided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a very short spell of time, the two ladies became closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed the navigation and came to a villa area where dozens of Soutaxia-style villas were located together in an orderly manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The greenery here was very good, with bright flowers blooming everywhere. The location of the Axe's headquarters manifested its founder's supreme taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After parking the car and getting out, he looked around and saw many elite guards protecting them openly and covertly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these guards had sharp eyes and a strong aura, which meant they were real fighters. They were also the foundation of the Axe's ability to stand in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, at least these people are no worse than Ian and his men." Alexander nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, here we are. Please follow me." Alyssa led them to the largest and most luxurious villa in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They followed closely behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alyssa coming back, a servant quickly opened the door to greet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the four of them walked in, servants immediately brought them hot towels, as well as a variety of fresh fruits and delicious snacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please have a taste of the tea of the Mandale Town." Alyssa took the teapot with a smile and poured a cup of coffee for Alexander herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servants and guards standing by were all shocked as they had never seen their boss be so polite and humble to someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a sip, Alexander savored the rich aroma of coffee, which was mellow and slightly sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raved, "It's so tasty. No wonder it's a specialty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice and Xavier also held the same opinion as Alexander after tasting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, can you tell me specifically about what happened between you and Ian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa asked curiously. In fact, she was curious about it in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice then briefly recounted the story of how he and Ian became enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I didn't expect to run into that bastard. Fortunately, Mr. Hawthorne stood up for me!" Alice said with some helplessness and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa smiled. "So romantic. It was also Ian's karma for domineering in this town. Breaking his legs was God's punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa had no good feelings towards Ian at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Ian molested her once. If Paxton wasn't there, she would have blown his head with a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I can see you're a skilled fighter. You almost overshadow my bodyguards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa couldn't help but praise him, and her beautiful eyes were always fixed on his body; she didn't want to hide her strong interest in Alexander at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Alyssa's fiery and aggressive gaze, Alexander smiled indifferently and replied with modest words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Alexander asked about the gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Top-grade gems are rare, among which are the scarcest are orange and purple gems. It will take you a lot of effort to collect them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she paused for a few seconds to recall the past and continued,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, the last time I saw an orange top-grade gem was ten years ago at an auction. It got the whole town astir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten years ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned and started to get a little worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Hawthorne. If we can't find these two gemstones in Mandalay, it's even more impossible to find them anywhere else. I have already sent out a message, asking for it with a high price. The top-grade gems must be someone's collection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa comforted Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very good at observing people's expressions and spoke in a pleasant way, making people feel cordial.</span></p></div>
