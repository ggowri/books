        <h1>Chapter 670 Purified</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, everyone saw the strange black demon puppet riding on Alexander's neck and pinching his throat hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pallid, and he showed no reaction with his eyes shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dereck chuckled triumphantly, "Alexander, weren't you very awesome just now? I'll give you a chance. If you hand over the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet, maybe I will let you survive a few more days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was full of confidence. As long as the demon puppet took action, everyone would be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very powerful. As long as the demon puppet took his life and sucked his blood, its strength would be greatly improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do? Mr. Hawthorne seems to be dying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This wizard is formidable. Is it true that the Axe has no choice but to perish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malone and the other Axe members looked pale and despondent.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander trembled violently as if he was about to fall down in the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Axe members had lost hope and felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wizards were indeed the strangest and most terrifying beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially at the sight of the ferocious demon puppet, they couldn't help but break out in cold sweats and were completely in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Mafia and the Weaver family silently watched the scene with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The demon puppet pulled out a bloody knife, put it on Alexander's neck, and attempted to cut off his head in one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dereck grinned and said, "You are really capable. You actually can hold on for so long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Alexander was still conscious, he showed a fierce expression on his skinny face and roared, "Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the urging of his master, the demon puppet uttered a strange chattering sound, and its pupil-less eyes suddenly widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its gray eyes, as big as walnuts, bloodshot and full of murderous intent, contrasted with the ugly, twisted scars on its face, making it look hideous and ghastly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade had cut through Alexander's skin, and he was on the verge of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weird supernatural power was indeed terrible, and even a Warrior couldn't resist it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the skin on Alexander's neck was scratched, the slight pain at once woke him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He violently activated the powerful Force within him, which surged and turned into the Force Burning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A huge white flame emerged and struck the demon puppet directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying heat of the Force Burning could destroy all evil, and like a maggot clinging to a bone, it enveloped the demon puppet tightly.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its struggles and shrieks, it couldn't get rid of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the bloody knife was quickly melted in the flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The demon puppet exploded and was reduced to ashes in the white flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, its head only lasted a few seconds longer and let out a shrill scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The demon puppet was burned and disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Alexander's All-seeing Eyes saw a pretty and adorable baby waving at him with a smile in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clearly that demon puppet. It was the little boy's remaining soul, purified by Alexander's Force Burning, and he was completely freed.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wisp of soul floated away into the sky with a laugh and was soon lost in the clouds.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dereck spat out a large mouthful of blood, staining his entire chest red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The demon puppet that symbolized his life was successfully purified by Alexander. He was but a shell now and would soon be dead.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dereck flopped down heavily on the ground, breathing weakly, and his already skinny frame became even more shriveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only his fierce eyes were fixed upon Alexander as if he were eager to bite him to death and eat him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned. They had just believed that Alexander would definitely be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their surprise, he suddenly fought back, purifying the demon puppet and killing the wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a dead silence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one spoke or fired a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley swallowed hard and glanced at Alexander with excitement and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite knowing that Alexander was very strong, he didn't expect him to be so mighty that he could even eliminate a wizard who possessed a demon puppet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander breathed a long sigh of relief. It was so dangerous just now. He almost got killed.</span></p></div>
