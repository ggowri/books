        <h1>Chapter 1049 Pure Evil</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since yesterday, people have come looking for that woman and the baby. I thought about calling the police, but I'm afraid there really are traitors in the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be safe, I've kept the guns there. If things get out of hand, I can protect them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom frowned deeply, clearly worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly offered, "Malcom, if you don't mind, I'd like to meet that woman. I have a few questions for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We came to Lumiria looking for a woman, someone from Risun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, of course," Malcom said eagerly. "The woman is quite beautiful. The baby isn't hers; she rescued him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander followed Malcom upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Malcom opened the door, Alexander's heart soared. That woman, to his surprise, was Hazel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sitting, cradling a few-month-old baby, feeding him from a bottle while gently patting his back, humming a lullaby. She looked every bit like a tender, loving mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander knew she couldn't have given birth to the baby. After all, she hadn't been in Lumiria from Risun for even half a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a short time, there was no way she could have been pregnant and given birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel's voice startled when she saw Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Cyclops send you to capture me?" she asked in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held the baby tightly, tears welling up in her eyes as she begged, "Please, don't kill Riley! If you let him live, I'll go with you. I promised Lorna I'd protect this child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, please, spare us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel wept, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, relieved. He had feared that Hazel might resist returning with him, but now it seemed easier than expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the baby had changed Hazel's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby cried loudly, and Hazel, in a panic, soothed him, her eyes brimming with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Riley, don't cry. I'll protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to plead with Alexander, "Please, spare us. If you do, I'll do anything you want. Anything</span><span>! </span><span>Just let us go</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback. He hadn't expected Hazel, who had once been captivated by Cyclops, to be so caring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked back and forth, softly singing and </span><span>coaxing</span><span> the baby in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the baby</span><span> stopped crying</span><span>, and he fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom quickly explained, "Don't worry. This gentleman isn't a bad guy. He's my niece's boyfriend. He came to Aetheris Street to find someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel let out a relieved sigh and gently laid the baby down, covering him with a blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she bent over, her ample chest fell, causing Alexander to stare in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel was young, but her body had certainly been shaped by Cyclops' twisted influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you talk. I'll go help with dinner," Malcom said, understanding the situation and heading downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walsh, my name is Alexander. I was sent by your sister Norma to bring you back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It took me a long time to track you down after Cyclops brought you here. I'm so glad I found you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander explained his purpose, and Hazel's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're... you're here to save me, sent by Norma?" she whispered, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears filled her eyes as she clutched her mouth and began to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so regretful. I shouldn't have trusted Cyclops... Norma warned me, but I didn't listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cyclops is a beast. He takes women, but he doesn't stop there. He even harms babies. They like to torture and kill, even eat people. They're monsters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel sobbed, pressing her hand to her mouth to stifle her cries, fearing the baby would wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? They eat people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face paled, a shiver running down his spine. Even with his formidable strength, he couldn't help but shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel wiped away her tears and continued, "If I weren't part of the Walsh family and have some value to them, they would have killed me long ago. Riley's mother, Lorna, was killed right in front of me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I barely managed to escape with Riley. Thankfully, these two kind people saved me. Otherwise, I'd be dead too..."</span></p></div>
