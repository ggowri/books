        <h1>Chapter 270 Conspiracy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't... I can't anymore. I give up, I surrender, spare me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned triumphantly, giving her a playful slap on her firm backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you admit defeat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do, I do... at least for today. But next time, when I'm in better shape, I'll beat you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty tried to keep up the tough act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, impressed by her persistent fighting spirit. It was this resilience that kept the fun alive and offered him more chances to enjoy himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a surge of Force energy building up inside him; it had grown significantly over the short period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty suddenly felt something hard pressing against her again, prompting her to quickly beg for mercy. She was unable to withstand it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, that's it for today. But I expect you to come back for revenge," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a strong sense of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you're like a woman's kryptonite. No wonder so many beauties are drawn to you," Betty sighed admiringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad I can't marry you," she added. "You've got too many women around, and there's no room for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes. "You think any other man is as good as me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty gave a bitter smile. After enduring Alexander's relentless treatment, she wasn't sure she could ever feel the same about another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two fell silent for a moment, and the atmosphere suddenly became a bit heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shrugged and said, "Well, love and passion can't be forced. What I really need is your loyalty and your body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force Control had already left a deep mark on Betty's mind, making it impossible for her to betray Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty huffed. "I'll practice yoga hard after I get back. Next time, I'll win for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. "Alright, alright. Practice hard. I'm rooting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how he looked at it, he benefited the most. But the thought that Betty might become someone else's wife someday conflicted with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander's phone rang, showing an unknown number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, don't you recognize my voice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar laugh came from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it's Mr. Hansen. What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't expect Orion to call him directly, and a sharp glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I sincerely invite you to tonight's banquet to welcome Lieutenant General Flores from the Northern Command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lieutenant General Flores will collaborate with me to establish a joint venture with the military. I hope you'll consider joining us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be there. We can discuss everything in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander agreed, then hung up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's invitation to join the company had ulterior motives. He was after the magic powder formula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty looked serious and said, "Boss, what are we going to do? A lieutenant general from the Northern Command has tens of thousands of elite soldiers under him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they attack, we'll defend. Tonight, I'll see what they're up to. The game has just begun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Treasure Island as a fallback, Alexander wasn't worried at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things got too hot in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, he could always relocate to Treasure Island, so he wasn't bothered by the lieutenant general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the news of Orion being favored by the military bigwigs and planning to start a new company spread like wildfire in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was talking about it, thinking the Hansen family was poised to rise even higher, and that Orion would surely be the heir to the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph was gravely ill, with little time left. The first heir, Lara, was already far behind Orion regarding reputation and influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion and his son, Jonas, were bowing and scraping to Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's face was stern, his gaze fierce, and he wore a crisp uniform with three silver stars on his shoulder epaulettes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion poured red wine and handed it to him with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder swirled the wine in the glass and gave a sly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Alexander will hand over the formula?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion patted his chest confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, General. Leave this to me. With your special forces backing us, even if Alexander doesn't want to, he'll have to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonas flattered eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father wanted me to hire the best assassins, but with your men involved, Alexander won't have a chance to escape tonight!"</span></p></div>
