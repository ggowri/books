        <h1>Chapter 1196 What a Waste</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait! Don't kill me... I can be your spy, just like Elaine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory was losing it, and the fear of death made him crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash like you isn't worthy of being my spy," Alexander spat, backhanding him across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory went flying like a ragdoll, his saber clattering to the ground. Blood sprayed from his mouth, and before he could even process what happened, Alexander materialized in front of him, smashing a fist into his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory went down again, and half his face was caved in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed him by the throat and hoisted him up like he weighed nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Gregory clawed desperately at Alexander's iron grip, and his face turned purple from lack of air. He fought with everything he had, trying to pry those fingers loose, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... spare me... I want to live..." He choked out between gasps, begging pathetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face remained stone-cold as his grip tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory's neck broke in an instant, and his face was frozen in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim collapsed on the floor, and his pants were soaked through. Pure terror and regret coursed through him as Alexander turned. His eyes were cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Alexander wouldn't let him off easy, Tim let out a desperate scream. He scrambled for the gun hidden under the couch and unloaded the entire clip at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to kill me, you bastard? Come on then!" he screamed, firing wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire ceased abruptly, followed by empty clicks as the magazine ran dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic. But hey, you brought this on yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Tim could blink, Alexander moved like a shadow, slipping past him in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy thud, Tim collapsed to the ground, clutching his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander towered over him, and his voice was ice-cold. "You can die in peace. I won't touch your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of gratitude crossed Tim's eyes before they glazed over, and the light faded from them forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a waste!" Alexander muttered, shaking his head at the body. "Had all the right cards and still managed to screw it up." He turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within minutes, Cloe's people stormed in, whisking Tim's family to safety and conducting a thorough sweep of the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was set to head back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> first thing tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After personally checking out both Treasure Island and Devil Island, he was pretty stoked about their development progress. It was quite a perfect timing to relocate headquarters here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, even if that old guy Yinson tried to pull something, Alexander would still hold all the cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That evening, Cloe insisted on cooking dinner for him herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned against the kitchen doorframe, watching her graceful figure move around the stove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe glanced back at him with a flirty smile before returning to her task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you staring at? I thought I told you to stay put in the living room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but love this cozy and domestic moment. He stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her from behind, keeping his hands respectfully at her waist while nuzzling her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm cooking! What else do you want to eat?" Cloe asked in a playful and flirtatious tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh shoot!" The oil in the pan suddenly caught fire, and flames shot up toward the ceiling. The romantic moment shattered instantly, with Cloe letting out a startled yelp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd only started learning to cook recently and had never set foot in a kitchen before that. The small accident left her frozen, and her face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander just laughed, smoothly grabbing the lid and placing it over the flaming pan while turning off the gas. The whole thing took him about two seconds like he'd done it a hundred times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe hadn't expected to mess up so badly. Her eyes welled up with tears of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here, you," Alexander chuckled, scooping her up and carrying her to the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole place was decked out with rose petals scattered across the furniture, filling the room with their sweet scent. But Alexander only had eyes for Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ducked her head, and her heart pounded so hard that she could hear it. Wrapping her arms tight around his neck, she nestled against his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with fragrance</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a mix of flowers and Cloe's perfume that made Alexander's head spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met, and he saw everything in her gaze</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>adoration, love, and this intense need to be close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their lips finally met, the world seemed to fade away around them.</span></p></div>
