        <h1>Chapter 394 Toasting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher's eyes lit up with excitement. "Here's your chance! He's handsome and wealthy. What are you waiting for? Go for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella blushed, remaining silent, but her eyes sparkled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his way home, Alexander received an urgent message from Mary: "Alexander, come to the </span><span>Hiltony</span><span> Hotel immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour earlier, in the </span><span>Hiltony</span><span> Hotel's conference hall:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary entered the room wearing an elegant gown, instantly drawing everyone's attention. This meeting was crucial, so she had dressed with care. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was at the height of her beauty and confidence, with a curvaceous figure and flawless skin. Her high heels clicked on the floor, emphasizing her grace and allure with every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men present couldn't help but notice her, including Satan's representative, Lawrence, and Eugene, a leader of the Blood Gang, along with several other gang leaders. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene's eyes lit up with desire as he watched her. He had admired Mary from afar, though she had never shown him any interest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being the head of the Blood Gang's </span><span>Loscity</span><span> branch, Eugene couldn't force anything on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene smirked to himself, determined not to let her slip away this time. "Miss, come sit with us," he said, his eyes lingering on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, you're even more stunning in person. I'm Lawrence, Satan's representative," he greeted her with a forced smile, his face wobbling with exaggerated enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence's smile was insincere, but he tried to mask it with a facade of warmth. "Good evening, Mary. They said the meeting wouldn't start without you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, the Blood Gang has flourished in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, thanks largely to your efforts!" others chimed in, masking their envy of a woman in charge with outward respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Mary took her seat, Eugene ordered some elegant snacks and drinks. "Let's relax a bit since we're among friends. Have a drink while we talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene poured Mary a drink, trying to be charming. Mary frowned, feeling uncomfortable under their predatory gazes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, she found herself toasting with them, each toast a thinly veiled attempt to get her to drink more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene, especially, was hard to refuse, forcing her to drink several glasses. Despite her growing annoyance, Mary kept her composure, her flushed face still maintaining a polite smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, here's to you. May you grow even more beautiful!" Eugene toasted again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Griffin, but this is my last one," Mary replied, clinking her glass with his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blush deepened, her sparkling eyes captivating Eugene, who couldn't help but stare, imagining his chances with her later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence picked up a bottle, smiling slyly. "Mary, I've heard rumors that you and Alexander are quite close. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's heart skipped a beat, sensing his ulterior motive. She calmly replied, "Alexander and I only have a business relationship. We're one of the distributors for the magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence chuckled, his tone turning sinister. "Don't lie to me, Mary. I have reliable information that you have slept with Alexander. Not only that, but Mr. Federer, Eddie, and several other Cripples leaders' deaths are linked to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blood Gang is fully aligned with us in the Mafia now. You'd better distance yourself from Alexander, or you'll face consequences," Lawrence warned, his voice cold with a chilling intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, drink three more glasses, and I'll overlook your past dealings," he demanded, clearly trying to cause trouble. Three more glasses of strong liquor, and Mary would be too drunk to remain conscious.</span></p></div>
