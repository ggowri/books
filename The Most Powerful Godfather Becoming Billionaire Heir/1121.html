        <h1>Chapter 1121 You're Awake</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, you must wake up. Even if you remain unconscious, I will always be with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stood by the window, watching Alexander through tear-filled eyes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, his eyes finally fluttered open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>White walls came into focus, along with beeping monitors and IV drips. A faint smile crossed his lips - he'd made it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Footsteps echoed in the hallway before a nurse wheeled her cart through the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava trailed behind, freezing when she saw Alexander's smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're awake?!" she gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gazed at Alexander in surprise and joy, and his deep eyes betrayed his delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rushed over and hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse immediately went out and called aloud for the doctors.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brody hurried over with several doctors and examined Alexander excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Brody exclaimed, "What a miracle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander was still confined to bed rest, his vitals were somehow perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brody couldn't believe it - the deadly cyanide hadn't left a single trace in his system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are out of danger now, but you need a good rest because of the loss of blood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brody and the others voluntarily left the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava held Alexander's head and stroked it tenderly, her eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great. That's great... How are you? Are you still feeling un</span><span>well</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really fine. Didn't the doctor say so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chuckle, Alexander rubbed his cheek against Ava's plump breasts and even took a light bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hey</span><span>, you've lost too much blood and haven't recovered yet. Stop</span><span> moving</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, Ava pinched Alexander's lips and then gave him a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed. "I want to go to the bathroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Let me help you</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava at once took Alexander's arm. He did not want her support at first, but he was really too weak in every way to control his limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They went to the bathroom and closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't move and gazed at Ava with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately understood his intention. Then, she snorted with a red face, unzipped his pants, and took his penis out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered, "Be careful and aim it </span><span>right</span><span>. Don't let me pee on the floor, or the nurse will blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He breathed a sigh of relief after the urine splashed into the toilet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was about to take him back to bed when he stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute. I have a way to recover soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared playfully at Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked in surprise, "What is it? Tell me, I will do as you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughing, Alexander grabbed her plump breast and rubbed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you forgotten that women can help me improve my strength? So, of course, </span><span>it</span><span> can help me recover quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava froze for a moment and then licked her sexy red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt before Alexander and took off his pants, which he had not yet pulled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A unique masculine smell wafted over, and he hadn't cleaned his penis just now. However, she buried her head in his crotch without hesitation...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander groaned lightly, felt dizzy, and almost lost his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, a subtle energy rose from his lower abdomen and quickly transformed into the Force, nourishing his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ava continued, he felt great pleasure and slowly regained the Force, which had been exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh no! Be careful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had picked her up in one go, lifting her full buttocks with both hands to suspend her in the air.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she wrapped her legs around his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you really recovered? It-It's amazing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was both delighted and astonished at Alexander's strong, powerful appearance.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she trusted him, she'd thought he was lying about women helping boost his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never imagined it was actually true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, all of Ava's doubts vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was still a woman, after all. Seeing all these beautiful women around Alexander, especially Grace's provocations, had been driving her crazy.</span></p></div>
