        <h1>Chapter 534 Naturally</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alcohol can only paralyze your will but won't help solve the problem. I can help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said kindly to guide her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully used Force Control to affect Nancy's will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's heart suddenly trembled, and she was inexplicably attracted by Alexander's </span><span>eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen many handsome guys, but never took them seriously. However, Alexander, with his unique temperament, was like a bright light in the darkness and deeply attracted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy could feel that Alexander wanted to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Alexander's extremely strong self-confidence had infected her, and suddenly made her feel very at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Brittany stood up and walked towards the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nobody else now. If you need any help, just tell me directly. If I can't do it, I will never come to you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made a firm promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy took a deep breath and hesitated for a while before speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a rule in the Kaylon that no matter who becomes the leader, he must get married as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> there is no internal conflict, but you were forced to get married by your family? According to your conditions, the man your family found for you must be very good. Don't you want to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy snorted disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you were different from the others, but it turns out you're just a dreamer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked with interest, "What do you mean? Are you not satisfied with the man your family has found?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am very dissatisfied!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy came back from the City of Sorcery. He is said to be a disciple of the elder of the City of Sorcery. My grandfather thinks highly of this guy and wants me to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will never agree to it! That bastard is so wretched. I don't know why my grandfather values him. It is a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy complained. She didn't think Alexander could help her. She just wanted to say it to release the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to this, Alexander burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect that he is also from the City of Sorcery. Interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting? It's not interesting at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy clenched her fists and looked very cute when she was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said very calmly, "I can help you break up this marriage. How about you be my woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's expression was quite complicated. She looked at Alexander with suspicion. She still didn't believe Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have a drink with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy took the initiative to pour a glass for Alexander and herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two cheered and drank them all in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fiery breath flowed down their throats along with the wine and instantly spread throughout their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today's wine seems to taste good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nancy praised, she felt her body burning, and the man in front of her seemed even more attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned for a moment and clearly felt that there were ingredients of a magic potion in the wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled that it was Brittany who had been pouring the wine. She must have put it in secretly, and she didn't come back after she went to the bathroom. It was obvious that she did it on purpose to leave him and Nancy alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will help you break up this marriage, and you will be my woman, how about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander brought it up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy suddenly giggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you fascinated by me? Don't quibble, you have been staring at me the whole time, I can feel that your eyes are scary..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared into Alexander's eyes and felt as if her soul was being sucked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I do have a good impression of you, but I'm not obsessed with you yet. Everything I do is to save my daughter. I want the Kaylon Pill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander confessed directly. It was not his character to lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy giggled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't realize you were so cunning before. You are good at picking up girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to use your daughter to gain sympathy. The Kaylon Pill is the secret treasure of the Kaylon. Without my blood blended into it, it cannot receive the blessing, and it will have no effect..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pretty face flushed and she looked at Alexander sideways. It was the first time she met such a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so natural for him to say that he wanted her body.</span></p></div>
