        <h1>Chapter 803 Compensation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained silent, calmly looking at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please don't torture me anymore. I'll do anything you ask." Zora began to convulse, foaming at the mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense pain contorted her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that she couldn't endure it any longer, Alexander kicked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the turbulent Force within Zora was temporarily suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gasped for breath. Her voluptuous body was covered in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled at her and said, "You just said you'd be obedient and do whatever I ask, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I'll do anything. Just don't make me go through that terrible pain again." Zora nodded in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander then called Marvin into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marvin saw Zora naked, he froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora, seeing Marvin's towering height and muscular build, shuddered in fear. She had a vague idea of what Alexander wanted her to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander patted Marvin's shoulder and said, "This woman is my gift to you. Enjoy her. After you're done, make her confess everything about the Dragon Gang and then compile it into a report for me by tomorrow noon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin was excited. "Boss, are you serious? This woman is mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander confirmed, "She's yours. From now on, she's your servant. If she doesn't listen to you, I'll make her wish she were dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora trembled all over. She promised, "I'll be obedient. I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander called Logan and left, leaving Marvin and Zora behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora watched Alexander's car drive away until the taillights disappeared into the night. Then she let out a deep sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin rubbed his bald head, looking at her with ill intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora shuddered and forced a smile. "What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin quickly stripped off his clothes, revealing his body as strong as a bear's. The sight of what was between his legs terrified Zora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come here and please me, or I'll tell my boss right now." Marvin threatened her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora hesitated for a moment before kneeling on the ground and crawling to Marvin like a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin reached out his large hands and grabbed her full breasts, kneading them forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ow. Be gentle, please," Zora pleaded pitifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marvin squeezed even harder, turning the elastic flesh red and shaping it in various ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin couldn't hold back like Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed Zora's plump buttocks and launched a fierce assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora was extremely sensitive and cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin was thrilled and continued his relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Zora let out a high-pitched cry and collapsed on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin let out a satisfied sigh, looked at the marks he left on Zora's body, and felt a sense of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt immense gratitude toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin understood that because he had pursued Charlize, but later, Charlize got into a relationship with Alexander. This was Alexander's way of compensating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin looked at Zora and chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only was she beautiful, but she also had a sexy figure and a sensitive body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waited for Zora to rest for a while and lightly kicked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Kneel and answer my questions honestly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next day at noon, Marvin brought the information about the Dragon Gang to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the Dragon Gang has bought the rights to Devil Island, the largest island near Treasure Island. It absolutely cannot fall into the hands of the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't expect that the Dragon Gang is also involved in the world's largest metal recycling business," Alexander muttered to himself as he read the information.</span></p></div>
