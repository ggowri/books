        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, she is very well trained!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Barry looked at Felix with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Danielle completely obeyed Felix's orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Felix ordered Danielle to show off her figure in public on the street, Danielle immediately carried out the order without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Joyce couldn't do this, which made Barry excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix pretended to be happy and humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Mr. Morris, thank you. As long as you like, I can let Danielle do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce spat at Danielle with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Barry was a pervert and had been drooling over Danielle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Joyce was willing to sleep with Barry unconditionally, she could not be as shameless as Danielle and expose herself in the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce knew that some men had this hobby and liked to expose their women in order to get pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still kept smiling and didn't dare to make Barry angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the butler, Diego, didn't even look at Danielle. He followed Barry closely, staring at Felix with a vigilant look from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry held Joyce with his left hand and Danielle with his right hand, enjoying everyone's envious and jealous gazes, feeling satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took a walk around the entertainment city. Barry attracted the attention of many men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wait and brought Danielle directly into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door slammed shut!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Danielle's moans and cries were heard from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix stood at the door with a gloomy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Danielle was just his toy, and he had originally planned to let Danielle sleep with Barry, Barry didn't take him seriously enough or even ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce glared at Felix coldly and scolded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you the chairman of the Red Umbrella Group? Why can't you keep your own woman? You're such a loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was so angry that he wanted to hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce said viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just stay here. Mr. Morris has a habit of drinking coffee after sex. Make him some coffee later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned and went into her room, closing the door heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix clenched his fists. If Diego hadn't been watching him not far away, he would have tortured Joyce to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the chairman of the Red Umbrella Group, he had never suffered such humiliation before. He felt like his whole body was burning with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only endure now. The best plan was to make Barry and Alexander both suffer losses, so that Felix could benefit from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could refine Barry and the other two into a life potion to help him break through, he would be able to manipulate Alexander at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix must be patient now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix reminded himself and took deep breaths. It was a long time before he calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not leave but stood at Barry's door, waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego had been staring at him and looked puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego thought, "Did Felix really surrender?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several minutes, the door of the room finally opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry walked out slowly, glanced at Felix, and said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make me a cup of coffee with milk and no sugar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said nothing and went to make coffee obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry sat on the sofa with his legs crossed, waiting for Felix to bring him the coffee, in a good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was so comfortable having the chairman of the Red Umbrella Group make him coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry took the coffee handed to him by Felix with both hands with a smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry said, "According to intelligence, Alexander is already on his way to </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> and will arrive in three hours. Let's play cards and wait for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander will definitely come here on his own. Even if he doesn't come, I will lure him over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beautiful waitress, who was cleaning, heard Alexander's name and frowned.</span></p></div>
