        <h1>Chapter 383 Discharge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had dressed Ashley in a new dress with her hair in a bun, making her look adorable. Ashley's big eyes fixed on </span><span>Alexander,</span><span> her smile as sweet as a doll's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital director, along with a group of doctors and nurses, respectfully saw Ashley off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The director, dealing with a high-ranking figure like Ava, dared not show any negligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by everyone like a little star, Ashley was escorted out of the hospital, after which the director and his team finally took their leave with deep bows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go celebrate at Aunt's house!" Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and casually looked into the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same van had been tailing them, and he smirked to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Alexander parked in Lily's driveway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had been waiting at the door. When she saw Ashley get out of the car, she ran up, laughing and crying, and hugged her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before getting out, Alexander glanced back at the van parked far away. The family came first; he'd deal with them later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Belinda was at the Fairfax Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda asked anxiously, "Jane, today's Ashley's discharge day. Why didn't you go to pick her up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew chimed in quickly, "Yes, if you go, you'll see Alexander. Try speaking kindly, maybe even plead a little. He might forgive you, for Ashley's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy has all the money now; he's at the peak of his power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, hair disheveled and a dazed expression, seemed lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, frustrated, nudged her, urging, "Jane, what are you thinking about? Change your clothes! Put on something sexy; you need to take advantage of this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're bankrupt, and I can't show my face anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda kept urging, "Jane, if Alexander grants us a distribution license for his magic powder, we can rise up again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane looked at her parents with a conflicted expression, letting out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think Alexander would give us another chance? Haven't you had enough setbacks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew gritted his teeth and said, "It's all because of that bastard Alexander! We're only begging him because we have no choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! I've already lost enough dignity. I refuse to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane suddenly snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew said angrily, "What do you mean? Are you really going to ignore us, your parents, and the future of our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda dropped to her knees in front of Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, at this point, you must go plead with Alexander. After all, you gave him a daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew knelt as well, pleading, "Dear, why do you think Alexander keeps going after us? Isn't it because he's not over you? Deep down, he still has feelings for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, why not use his feelings and Ashley? Have him give our family another chance, and everyone wins, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Jane started to hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha </span><span>ha</span><span> </span><span>ha</span><span>! The Fairfax family wants to rise again? It's easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a burst of laughter echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man with gold-rimmed glasses and a refined air strode over, followed by a large group of black-suited bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you, and how did you get in?" Andrew asked, displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second later, he froze, his eyes widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! Aren't you the one from the news... the CEO of the Red Umbrella Group... Felix?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda and Jane were equally stunned, staring wide-eyed at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group's financial power and connections far surpassed that of the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that the Red Umbrella Group had military ties, which granted it many privileges unmatched by any other corporation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix adjusted his glasses and said with a smile, "I didn't expect Mr. Fairfax to recognize me right away. Impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was instantly overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, did you... did you just say you could help my family rise again? Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's expression shifted as this scene felt all too familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan and Schroder had once said the same, only for it all to end in disgrace and disappointment for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, her face pale, said, "Mr. Vanderbilt, I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in being your woman. Please leave."</span></p></div>
