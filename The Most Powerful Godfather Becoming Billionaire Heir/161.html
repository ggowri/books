        <h1>Chapter 161 Waiting for You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was momentarily taken aback, realizing that Alexander was the one overseeing this luxurious mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, being associated with the Saint Group was a big deal, and he knew Alexander was someone worth getting to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clapped Alexander on the shoulder, his enthusiasm bubbling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, wow! You're really making waves, working for the Saint Group. That's one of the top companies in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>! I owe you big time for today. If you ever need anything, just say the word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier thumped his chest in assurance, eager to show his newfound respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Actually, I do need a favor. I'm looking to buy some high-end gemstones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"High-end gemstones? Those are some serious treasures!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's interest piqued even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander was in the market for premium gems, he clearly had more influence than Xavier had initially thought. Even if Alexander wasn't the owner of the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor, he was definitely someone to reckon with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you've come to the right person! Everyone knows the Kaylon runs the gemstone trade in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, but most of their stones actually come from us, the Ulysses family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've just discovered a stunning yellow gemstone, but the Kaylon are gearing up for an auction. Are you interested in participating?" Xavier said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of excitement at the mention of the Ulysses family as the source of the gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Kaylon already invited me, so I'll definitely be there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was brimming with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could build a solid relationship with Alexander, maybe his mother would finally stop berating him for living a life of indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier, I've got to run. Take care," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already checked out the villa and felt quite satisfied with its luxurious furnishings and fully equipped amenities&mdash;it was truly move-in ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks a lot, Alexander! If anything comes up, just let me know. I'll make sure to tell my mom about this, and if we find any more top-notch gems, I'll give you the heads-up first," Xavier said, fawning over Alexander as he helped Alexander into a waiting taxi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer, who had been watching the exchange, raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, is this Alexander for real? He's part of the Saint Group, yet he doesn't even own a car?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier shot her a dismissive glance. She was attractive, no doubt, but her lack of insight was frustrating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's called being low-key, you know? The real big shots are usually the ones who keep it under the radar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see," Jennifer replied, snuggling closer to Xavier, her voice sweet and playful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, thanks for showing me the Grand Hyatt Estates' Majestic Manor. I promise I'll hold up my end of the deal... so, should we head back now? You can call the shots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier felt a rush of excitement, his dick responding to her closeness as he grinned wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He playfully patted her backside. "You little tease, let's get back right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the taxi carrying Alexander pulled away, a sleek black Bentley appeared out of nowhere, cutting off his ride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bentley honked twice before the driver's door swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's brow furrowed in confusion. "Who on earth could that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out stepped Mary, her presence as striking as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a form-fitting black dress that hugged her curves, and she radiated a confidence that turned heads. It was hard not to see her as a ripe peach, tempting and ready to be plucked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne! I've been waiting for you. I have a rather bold favor to ask of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback. He hadn't expected to encounter the chapter leader of the Blood Gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fleeting thought crossed his mind&mdash;the last he'd heard from </span><span>Alice</span><span>,</span><span> Mary was conspiring with </span><span>Houtte</span><span>. Now, here she was, seeking his help. He mused, "Is this all part of some elaborate scheme?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's puzzled expression, Mary smiled alluringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Initially, I thought about sending my assistant to fetch you, but I figured it would be more sincere if I came myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping his tone neutral, Alexander asked, "Is this urgent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary wasted no time, pulling him toward her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she leaned in, her ample boobs brushed against Alexander's arm, the warmth and softness shocking him momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that you possess some mysterious talents for curing all kinds of ailments. I'm genuinely here to ask for your help with my mother's health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, caught off guard by her directness. He suddenly felt the unexpected pressure as Mary collided with him, her boobs pressing against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a jolt run through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's cheeks flushed a delicate pink, and she met his gaze with a flirtatious look.</span></p></div>
