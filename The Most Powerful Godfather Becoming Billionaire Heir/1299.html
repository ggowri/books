        <h1>Chapter 1299 Verdant Crown Melon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Risuneses slaves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's sharp gaze locked onto the two boys. He turned to the tall, lanky worker. "They dared to steal Verdant Crown Melons! I don't care who they are. Take them to the woodshed. We'll send them to the police first thing in the morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan were bound tightly and marched ahead, shoved and prodded from behind. If they so much as slowed down, they were met with a hard whack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan yelped along the way. "Aren't you church folks? Show some mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked in silence, his expression grim, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The melon field was enormous. They had already been walking for miles. Normally, a church wouldn't own such vast farmland. And every so often, there were small huts scattered throughout the field, each with a dimly lit lantern inside. From within, he could hear the faint sounds of people chatting and laughing. They were probably the field guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group walked by torchlight for nearly an hour. They had covered about ten miles before finally reaching the edge of the farmland, and approaching the church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, the darkness had obscured most of the details. But now that they were close, Alexander and Logan both froze in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The church was massive, its exterior painted in a soft yellow hue. The surrounding wall towered over ten yards high, its upper section a deep crimson. The sheer scale of the structure was overwhelming. The wall stretched far beyond their line of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall arched gate stood at the front, and above it, three golden words gleamed in bold, flowing script: [Dominion Church.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the walls lay a sprawling complex of buildings. Rising among them was an enormous hexagonal pagoda, dozens of stories high, piercing the heavens. At its peak, a divine radiance shimmered in shifting hues, bathing the surroundings in a sacred glow. The entire place exuded an awe-inspiring grandeur, like a holy sanctuary brought to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move it! What are you gawking at? You really are just a couple of clueless little slaves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pockmarked worker swung a bamboo pole, striking Logan's shoulder. Logan had had enough. He straightened his back and snapped, "You can't just bully people like this! What kind of church behaves this way? Why are you all so damn aggressive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was furious. After being pushed around for so long, he couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flickered with mischief. He suddenly started stomping and yelling at the top of his lungs. "Help! They're bullying children! Someone, come quick! The church folks are beating up kids! Oh, the cruelty&mdash;!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wails echoed far into the night, piercing the quiet air like a siren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop yelling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos erupted. The workers scrambled to silence Alexander, covering his mouth and trying to restrain him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's thick face twitched in rage. His eyes flashed dangerously as he raised his right hand. A surge of energy crackled around his palm like rolling thunder as he swung a crushing blow toward Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a powerful voice rang out from within the church walls. "Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's heart skipped a beat, but it was too late to stop. His strike landed squarely on Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A muffled groan escaped Alexander's lips. His small frame trembled. Blood gushed from his mouth in violent spurts. Then, his body went limp, collapsing to the ground in a motionless heap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan threw himself over Alexander, his voice breaking. "Hit me instead! Leave him alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the heavy gates of the church swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly friar stepped out first, flanked by two friars in deep blue robes. One carried a candelabrum, while the other led an enormous, blue-furred lion by a leash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lion didn't act aggressively. It simply swayed its massive head, following behind the old friar like a well-trained beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The friar had a broad forehead and deep, intelligent eyes. His simple yet elegant robes, combined with his dignified aura, commanded respect at a single glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he appeared, the workers and Donald quickly bowed in greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-rowdy crowd fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Head Priest Hezekiah "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hezekiah Ramsey shot Donald a withering glare before striding swiftly toward Alexander. With a firm grip, he pulled Logan off the unconscious boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knelt, placing one hand against Alexander's back and the other over his chest. His deep, sonorous voice resonated as he began chanting sacred verses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words carried a soothing rhythm, washing over the crowd like a calming tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he chanted, a strange yet pleasant fragrance filled the air. A faint, multicolored glow seeped from Hezekiah's palm, gently enveloping Alexander's wounded chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes passed. Slowly, Alexander's pallid complexion regained color. His breathing evened out. He looked as though he had merely fallen into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hezekiah rose to his feet and turned to Donald, his gaze sharp. "We do not harm others. Donald, explain yourself. Why are you doing this?"</span></p></div>
