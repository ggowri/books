        <h1>Chapter 876 Fishing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With every step Alexander took, Norma was hit hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I can't stand it. It's so comfortable to have sex with you. I think you can definitely become a super porn star. Ouch! No, you can only belong to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's lewd screams could be heard from a great distance, but this was the sea, and there was no one else except those crew members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all members of the Dragon Gang. They dared not say a word and all hid in the cabin obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a full hour, the sex finally ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was so exhausted that she could not even stand. Her face was flushed, and she felt weak all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are tired, too, right? Take a good rest. You can go fishing and play in the water."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was concerned about him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fishing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pondered about it and agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only way to break free from the shackles of advancement was to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature, which was very important to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander called the captain out of the cabin, asked him to steer the boat, and changed into swimming trunks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The captain and the waiters gazed at him with admiration and envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were amazed by the long period of intimacy between Alexander and Norma just now. They didn't expect that a man could make love for so long. It was simply a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the yacht stopped at a spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two large parasols were erected on the front deck, and the waiters placed recliners and a table with a variety of fruits and drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a nice day. The sea was calm, like a huge blue gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander lay on his back on the recliner in a good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, Norma came out, having changed into her swimsuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the sound of her footsteps, Alexander glanced back, and his heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was dressed in a sexy bikini swimsuit, but it was different from what he had imagined, as she was wearing a white gauze over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her plump and curvy figure was faintly visible under the thin gauze, making her more mysterious and sensual.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma walked towards Alexander with a model's gait, her round butt swaying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the gauze, her voluptuous body was captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Alexander had just had sex with her, he was aroused again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was all Norma's fault. She understood men too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a thin outfit was much easier to excite men than a bikini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma chuckled, "Don't worry. There are more than 600 pounds of iridium in total. I have arranged for someone to deliver it to Loscity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander immediately relaxed a lot. Getting enough iridium was one of the main goals of his trip here.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I have already stamped and signed the transfer agreement of Devil Island. It will be transferred to you free of charge, and the Dragon Gang will invest and develop it together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Devil Island was originally our property. We spent a lot of money buying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, if you can leave some territory for the Dragon Gang, I will have an explanation for those stubborn elders in the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma glanced at Alexander cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He agreed without hesitation, "No problem at all. I will leave a good piece of land for the Dragon Gang at the most prosperous dock on Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can tell them that I will help the Dragon Gang deal with the Sakra Society!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma smiled at Alexander, "That's great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The fish is hooked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander grabbed the fishing rod and swung it, causing it to shake violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's some tuna, a really big one. We can't let it get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of splashing water was heard, and the big fish rolled and struggled in the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fishing rod had been bent into an arc, but the big fish was still firmly on the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander swung the rod hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fat tuna, weighing a couple of dozen pounds, fell to the deck, flapping its wings desperately, its mouth opening and closing incessantly. Its tail flapped, striking the deck with a loud crackling sound.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander threw away his fishing rod and smiled, "What are you still standing there for? Hurry up and ask someone to cook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The waiters were dumbfounded. They had never seen fishing like this before. A big fish could be caught with just one cast of the rod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Alexander's urging, they quickly began to dispose of the tuna.</span></p></div>
