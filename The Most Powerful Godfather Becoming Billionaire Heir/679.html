        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them were entangled together. Alexander picked up Alice and carried her on his shoulders. He hugged Alyssa and Beverly on his left and right and strode towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women knelt obediently on the bed, allowing Alexander to choose them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spent the whole evening with the three women and had a great time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they had no more strength left and fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was full of energy. And his Force had greatly increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander prepared to return to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purpose of his trip had been achieved. Alexander had upgraded his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by Alyssa and Beverly, Alexander picked out some gems again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women became much closer after last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all smart and understood what Alexander meant, so they tried to be friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't like each other, but they wanted to please Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't expect them to get along, just peace. If they had too good a relationship, it would not be good for him to control </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Alexander chose some jewelry for Ava, Rebecca, and others. Of course, he only bought expensive and good quality ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't been home for so many days and missed Ava very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Ava said that she wanted to bring her mother, Lynn, to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. Alexander </span><span>felt excited when he thought of the plump bodies of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa and Beverly brought a large group of people to take Alexander to Goldford Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before parting, Alyssa and Beverly seemed reluctant to leave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for what they were thinking, Alexander didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly had been controlled. And Alyssa was loyal to him for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia might want revenge on the Axe next. Alexander was prepared for that, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he occupied Treasure Island, he would dispatch some people to </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town, so that </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town's defense would be stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long flight, Alexander and Alice finally returned to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's authorized agent, Xavier temporarily stayed in </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finally back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava saw Alexander and threw herself into his arms at </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Hey, you smell so good. Did you just take a shower. Can't you wait?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and sniffed behind her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop that. I don't take a bath for that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava blushed in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took her hand and got into the car. Alice was jealous of Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Has Lynn come here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava said, "Oh, you are such a bad guy! Mom said she is busy at the company and can only come next week."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two flirted and kissed in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a modified commercial vehicle with a metal soundproofing panel between the back seat and the driver, so Ava was relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to touch you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and put his hand on Ava's collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He touched Ava's breasts. It was too big to be controlled with one hand, soft and elastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were seductive. Ava moaned as she grabbed his genitals and rubbed it skillfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander directly carried her to his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "What a little slut! You came to pick me up without wearing any underwear. And you prepared a car like this. You can't wait, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased. Ava blushed and lay on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the moving commercial vehicle began to shake violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver was stunned, and then, deliberately slowed down the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver took more than an hour to drive what was supposed to be a half-hour journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava got out of the car, leaning weakly on Alexander. Her charming eyes and cheeks were attractive. She looked content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver felt complicated as he watched the two walk into the villa, snuggling together. He was not jealous of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was so tired that she fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander went to the study and opened several heavy suitcases, which contained various high-grade gems, all classified according to size, shape, and color.</span></p></div>
