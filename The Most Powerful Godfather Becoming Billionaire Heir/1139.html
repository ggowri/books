        <h1>Chapter 1139 Eager to Flatter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Just as they were eagerly waiting, a convoy of black Mercedes-Benz cars zoomed in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s gotta be Mr. Merrett,&quot; Joaquin said, his eyes lighting up. &quot;Everyone, stay sharp. Show the proper respect.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The cars screeched to a stop in front of the restaurant, drawing curious glances from passersby. It was clear that someone important had arrived.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As soon as the cars stopped, Joaquin rushed forward and swung open the door to the middle car.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A middle-aged man stepped out, wearing a traditional Risun outfit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He wasn&#x27;t particularly tall, maybe shorter than six feet, and his hair was tied in a traditional topknot. At his side, he carried two sabers, one long, one short.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Despite his average height, there was an undeniable aura of power about him. His eyes were sharp, piercing, and almost unnatural, as if they could cut through anything. Anyone who made eye contact with him instinctively lowered their gaze.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Merrett, welcome! We&#x27;ve been waiting for you!&quot; Joaquin bowed deeply, his voice trembling. He didn&#x27;t dare look up, his heart pounding.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen was the top enforcer in Sakra Society, the right hand of Yinson.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin, though a key member, knew he was a long way from being on Stephen&#x27;s level. The difference in their standing felt like an ocean.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen didn&#x27;t spare him a glance. His voice was cold, almost mocking. &quot;Joaquin, I can see you&#x27;re shaking. Are you cold? Or do you just find me that scary?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">An icy wave of murderous intent swept through the air, making everyone freeze. It felt like the temperature had dropped several degrees.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Merrett... You must be joking. How could I be scared of you? You&#x27;ve had a tough time leading this operation,&quot; Joaquin stuttered, sweat pouring down his forehead. His legs were shaking uncontrollably now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The tension in the air was thick, and no one dared to speak.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a long pause, Stephen finally gave a slight nod, his voice dripping with bitterness. &quot;So, Tyler didn&#x27;t make it? Looks like the Loscity team&#x27;s been wiped out. Damn Alexander... I&#x27;ll make him pay for this.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin jumped in quickly. &quot;Mr. Merrett, we sent out thirty-six teams to thirty-six cities. Except for Loscity, where the team was wiped out, the rest of the missions went smoothly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;According to my calculations, we&#x27;ve gained control of 56 top figures, 72 companies with over 100 million dollars in assets. It&#x27;s been a huge success, and that&#x27;s all thanks to you, Mr. Merrett.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Good,&quot; Stephen said, nodding approvingly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When he returned to Risun, Yinson would undoubtedly reward him with money, women, and, most importantly, the enhancement drugs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His face softened slightly, and he finally smiled, &quot;Even though the Loscity team failed, the results are still something to be proud of. Mr. White won&#x27;t hold it against us. Let&#x27;s keep pushing. Don&#x27;t let him down.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes, thank you, Mr. Merrett!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The group exhaled, their nervous tension finally easing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Merrett, I&#x27;ve arranged a meal for you, and I&#x27;ve got your favorite women ready as well,&quot; Joaquin said with a wide smile, clearly trying to please him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen, now at the top of the food chain, second only to Yinson, was a man they had to keep on their good side.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Good. You know how to treat me right,&quot; Stephen replied with a satisfied nod as he entered the restaurant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The rest of the group quickly followed each of them trying their best to flatter him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Great seafood here. Eat your fill.&quot; A sweet voice called out from behind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Stephen turned sharply, clearly irritated. A group of men was escorting a young woman, probably in her twenties, into the restaurant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Brianna, why do you always want this kind of food? It&#x27;s fresh but not sanitary, full of parasites,&quot; the bald man leading the group said, shaking his head.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Brock, it&#x27;s my birthday today. I&#x27;ll eat whatever I want. You said so, right?&quot; the woman pouted playfully, shooting him a teasing look.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Right, right.&quot; The bald man grinned. &quot;It&#x27;s your birthday, so you can have whatever you want,&quot; he smiled mischievously and gave her a playful slap on the backside.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Brock, you&#x27;re terrible! There are so many people watching!&quot; The woman giggled, leaning into him as she playfully swatted him away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He laughed loudly, &quot;You&#x27;re my woman. What&#x27;s the big deal? Let them watch all they want. They can just stare while I do what I want.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Huh? I thought we reserved the whole place?&quot; The woman noticed Stephen and his group and seemed surprised.</p></div>
