        <h1>Chapter 660 Increase in Strength</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the guards outside rushed in, they saw Barton's body slumped on the bed, with blood and brain matter staining the sheets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Mr. Estevan is dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards screamed and trembled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not go far but hid on the ceiling, quietly watching the development of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he wanted to make the southern Mining leaderless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard rushed out and shouted desperately in the corridor, "Mr. Estevan is dead! Someone </span><span>come</span><span> quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other people in the building were immediately alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Estevan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the tragic scene of Barton being shot in the head, everyone panicked and quickly called other senior executives of Southern Mining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights were on in the mining headquarters, and everyone knew that Barton had been assassinated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen senior executives of Southern Mining were present, all with their bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Barton, who was dead in bed, with different expressions. Some were surprised, some were afraid, and some were worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at them coldly. The top executives of Southern Mining were more rational than the people of the Glory Association and did not panic the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Barton was dead, they were still discussing matters like how to catch the murderer and strengthen defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. No matter how smart they were, they could not imagine that the murderer was right above their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gun in his hand fired. It was a gun with an extended magazine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander emptied one magazine, he reloaded another one. Dozens of bullets were emptied in a few seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before more than a dozen senior executives of Southern Mining could react, they had their heads blown off, leaving a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and walked out through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire southern Mining was in chaos. All the senior executives were assassinated, and the others were helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander notified Alyssa again, and then he created chaos at the headquarters himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen houses were set on fire, power supply facilities were destroyed, and the entire headquarters was plunged into darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gunshots rang out everywhere, accompanied by shrill screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were even huge explosions at gas supply facilities and oil depots, sending up fiery red mushroom clouds that lit up the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loud rumbling noises that came one after another alarmed everyone in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander alone disrupted the entire southern Mining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more than 200 members of Southern Mining were stunned. They couldn't find the enemy, nor did they know how many enemies there were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of people were killed or injured by Alexander, and the rest were unable to organize an effective defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only watch as their companions fell one by one with screams and explosions and fires everywhere. It was a doomsday scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in Southern Mining felt the good times were over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alyssa and the Axe arrived aggressively, all the people in the southern Mining immediately laid down their weapons and surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even felt more at ease, as their lives were no longer in danger after surrendering to the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For these grassroots members, it didn't matter whether they worked for Southern Mining or the Axe as long as they could make money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the sky was beginning to get brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made a fuss all night and temporarily stopped his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mafia and other forces must have been on guard. The Axe had been busy all night, although they were excited, they were exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe's current priority was to quickly absorb the manpower and wealth of the two major forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dawn, Mandale Town was in an uproar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have imagined that the Axe was so powerful. In just one night, the Glory Association and Southern Mining were swallowed up by the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Axe had just gathered the remaining members of the two major forces, their combat effectiveness might not be very high, but their strength had indeed increased dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, in Paxton's eyes, the Axe became threatening and even terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Mafia couldn't swallow up the two major forces overnight. Paxton temporarily retreated, and other forces immediately withdrew from the alliance against the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton wanted to figure out what happened last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did the Axe suddenly become so powerful? And he heard that they didn't lose a single person, which was hard to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alyssa, that bitch, hides her power so well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton talked to himself, his face looking very gloomy.</span></p></div>
