        <h1>Chapter 1293 Paying You Off</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia turned around, grabbed her designer handbag, and reached inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out a thick stack of cash and flung it at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The best male models in Kylaville charge five thousand. I'll double that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's ten grand. Take the money and get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She crossed her arms over her chest, exuding arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even glance at the money. Instead, he smirked and said, "If you want me gone, at least let me put my pants on first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you shameless bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia nearly choked on her anger. She grabbed an ashtray and hurled it at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reacted quickly, catching it midair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he got dressed, he was secretly amazed at how his body had changed. Ever since regaining a trace of the Force, his strength and reflexes had clearly improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was still full of questions. He thought, "Why am I here? What happened before this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where did the zombies and mutated beasts go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move faster and get the hell out, you useless man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's sudden ridicule snapped Alexander back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pride as a man felt challenged, and he immediately shot back, "Whether I'm useless or not, the one who experienced it should know best. Who was begging for more last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's face turned crimson. She wanted nothing more than to throw him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice rose in shame and anger. "Take your payment and get lost. I slept with you! I don't need you to take responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. "Consider it a free trial. Next time, you'll have to pay. See you around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he grabbed the unconscious Maxwell off the floor and strode out of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he reached the door, a sudden gust of wind rushed toward him from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His instincts kicked in, and he dodged to the side. Half a wine bottle whizzed past his head, barely missing his hair before shattering it against the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia had thrown it with full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his reflexes hadn't improved, he would have been hit. At best, he'd be bleeding. At worst, he'd be knocked out with a concussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and glared at Silvia. "What the hell do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic man! In a month, I'm getting engaged to Lonnie. He's from the Atkinson family, one of Kylaville's top elite families. You can't afford to cross him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better pray no one ever finds out about today. Because even if Lonnie doesn't kill you, I will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled, filled with despair and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Relax. As long as you're not Ava, I won't cling to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. Let's just pretend this was a dream. It's better for both of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked away without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia curled up in the corner of the couch, covering her face as tears streamed down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why... why did this have to happen..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betrayed by a friend, her purity, which she had guarded for over twenty years, was suddenly taken away. The loss and pain were unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a familiar soft cough sounded behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia shuddered in fear. She looked up and saw that Alexander had returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! Why are you back?! What do you want now? I'll call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror flashed across her face. Her whole body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a sigh. "I wrote you a prescription. It's your first time going through this. The pain will last at least a week. Crush these herbs into powder and apply them. You'll feel better in half a day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia snapped. She grabbed her phone and hurled it straight at Alexander's nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to dodge at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were too close, and Silvia moved too fast. The phone grazed his ear, sending a sharp sting of pain through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really don't know what's good for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clutched his ear, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia buried her face in her knees and sobbed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine! Stop crying. I'm leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed and stepped out of the villa, shutting the door behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence filled the room. Silvia sat on the floor, drained and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes drifted to the red stain on the couch. The memory of last night flashed through her mind. Her pale face flushed crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced herself to stand, determined to check the security cameras and confirm that Alexander was truly gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment she moved, pain shot through her. She nearly collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't even walk anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Going to a hospital was out of the question. She was a woman of status. If news spread that she had been so wild in bed that she had to see a doctor, she would become a laughingstock.</span></p></div>
