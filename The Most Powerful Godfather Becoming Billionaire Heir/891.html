        <h1>Chapter 891 Constraining Abilities</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Human potential is limitless. As described in the teachings of Ultimate Legacy, every person carries within them an energy universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was once a news story about a mother who found her child trapped beneath rubble after an earthquake, barely clinging to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unconditional love and sense of duty for her child ignited her inner universe in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her adrenaline levels skyrocketed to terrifying heights in mere moments!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That mother, relying solely on her own strength, lifted a heavy concrete slab and saved her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin was the same now&mdash;driven by rage and the bond of brotherhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He erupted completely, like an enraged tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body trembled violently, his movements growing faster and faster, leaving behind afterimages as he neared breaking free from his restraints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying snakes and venom were closing in on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman suddenly screamed, "No... My psychic restraints... I can't hold him much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke's face flashed with surprise once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish speaking, Marvin leapt up, grabbing Shadow as he swiftly dodged all incoming attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Locke cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke's expression turned grim. He had dual abilities&mdash;not only could he control venomous snakes, but he also possessed second-level firearm manipulation skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands moved in a blur, conjuring an invisible, eerie force that churned around </span><span>him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swarm of snakes grew even more agitated, launching a frenzied assault on Marvin and Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin fired his compact submachine gun relentlessly as he and Shadow retreated under fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the snakes were shot to pieces, their bodies writhing on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a piercing gunshot rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sniper bullet grazed Marvin's arm, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with countless snakes swarming them and Locke sniping from the shadows, both Marvin and Shadow felt a sense of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another shot rang out as Locke's sniper bullet, enhanced by his abilities, flew rapidly toward Marvin's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A life-or-death moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bullet flew in at a barely visible speed, colliding violently with Locke's shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke's bullet was instantly shattered, the opposing bullet clearly far more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss!" Marvin shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir!" Shadow cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Shadow cheered in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the battle had lasted only a few minutes, it felt as if decades had passed for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Locke's expression shifted. "Alexander is here! He's got a sniper rifle, too&mdash;be careful!" he warned urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pale flames erupted around Shadow and Marvin, reducing any attacking cobras to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the venom was vaporized by the flames before it could reach them, vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undeterred, Locke directed the snake swarm to continue its attack on Shadow and Marvin while firing at the rapidly approaching figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, two gunshots echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke's bullet, enhanced by his second-level firearm ability, was exponentially faster and more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's bullet, however, was infused with a faint aura of the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bullets collided with force, shattering Locke's shot into countless fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's bullet continued its lightning-fast path, striking Locke squarely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Locke dodged quickly, and the bullet only grazed his left arm rather than hitting his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, even the graze tore a chunk of flesh from Locke's arm, leaving it bloodied and nearly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, pale and anxious, said, "I can't restrain him at all... His psychic ability is stronger than mine. I can't do it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke, with a cold tone, reminded her, "His sniper rifle reloads quickly. You have less than two seconds to attack. If you fail, both of us will be killed by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up! Use your full power and unleash your strongest ability!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman closed her eyes again, stretching her hands toward Alexander's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke shouted, "I've got him locked! Now's the time&mdash;restrain him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!" she screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman shouted loudly, clearly using every ounce of her strength. Her voice was piercingly unpleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke took aim at Alexander and pulled the trigger with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bullet tore through the air, reaching Alexander in the blink of an eye.</span></p></div>
