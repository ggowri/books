        <h1>Chapter 776 Backup Forces</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beverly and Yvonne had both been conquered by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alexander had truly saved Alyssa, Beverly believed that if she ever got into trouble, Alexander would save her too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne followed behind Alexander like a maid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she was full of ambition and cunning, she only showed this side to others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must be tired. Go rest. We'll leave for the City of Sorcery in two days. I have a score to settle with Monica," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne agreed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa looked at Yvonne with mixed feelings. Yvonne was wearing Alexander's clothes, her long legs exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa knew what had happened between them and felt jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she didn't dare show her anger in front of Alexander. She ordered her followers to take good care of Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Yvonne left, Alyssa couldn't help but scold her followers, "Why are you all standing here? Get out and do your jobs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The atmosphere became tense, and everyone quickly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beverly wanted to say something but couldn't find the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, she asked cautiously, "Master, would you like me to help you take a bath and rest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you help me bathe, how can I rest?" Alexander glanced at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beverly turned pale, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "I'm just teasing you. Both of you can help me bathe and relax."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and put his left arm around Alyssa and his right arm around Beverly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa's annoyance was instantly replaced by joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beverly blushed and hugged Alexander, giving him a big kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone watched enviously as Alexander and the two beautiful women went into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard Alyssa and Beverly have been with Mr. Hawthorne for a long time," someone whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shh, don't say that. Mr. Hawthorne might hear you and get angry," another person warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Be quiet. Mr. Hawthorne is our role model. Don't get into trouble," someone else added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander heard their whispers and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed to be in top shape for his trip to the City of Sorcery in two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as they entered the bedroom, Alyssa and Beverly quickly took off their clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bodies pressed against Alexander, and their hands caressed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa knelt in front of Alexander, unzipped his pants, and started serving him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander let out a long sigh, feeling relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beverly got upset. She quickly pushed her breasts toward Alexander's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the bedroom was filled with moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next day, Alexander ordered Shadow and Marvin to lead a thousand elite soldiers from Treasure Island to a small town near the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group included 100 metahumans, experts, and 50 warriors with combat exoskeletons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander not only wanted to kill Monica but also to take over the City of Sorcery. He needed strong backup forces to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he couldn't fight hundreds of wizards alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After making all the arrangements, Alexander focused on improving his Force. He stayed in his room for a whole day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alyssa, Beverly, and Yvonne took care of him, either one by one or all together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three women had amazing figures, with firm and elastic skin, as they exercised every day and were different from ordinary women.</span></p></div>
