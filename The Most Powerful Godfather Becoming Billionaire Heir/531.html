        <h1>Chapter 531 Perfect Beauty</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like me? Or do you want to support me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy still kept smiling, but she looked contemptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sounded like everything was under her control, and she seemed to have magical power, making people feel ashamed and fearful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter didn't dare to look Nancy in the eye. He lowered his head and nodded hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, I like you and want to be with you. No matter how much money you want, I will agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked him up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said calmly, "Do you think I'm a woman you can buy with money? You're wrong. No matter how much money you have, I'm not interested in you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I guess correctly, at your age, you should have a wife and children, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter nodded repeatedly without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I have a wife, but I can divorce her. For you, I can even give up my wife and children!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy sneered contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is what a man is like. You're such a bastard. Get out, treat your wife well in the future, and don't come here again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you scold me and ask me to get out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter was so angry that his whole body was shaking. He felt humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy glanced at him coldly, and a murderous aura suddenly burst out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter was so scared that he took several steps back, stumbled, and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trembled and dared not look at Nancy, and cried like a wronged child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy didn't bother to look at him anymore and waved to the security guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drag him out and never let him in again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we will do it. Don't worry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two security guards agreed incoherently. They became nervous every time they saw Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Nancy was just a disc jockey in the bar, they subconsciously obeyed her orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi, Nancy, babe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone hugged Nancy from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's expression changed and she was about to avoid it, but she smelled a familiar woman's body fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned around suddenly and shouted with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany hugged Nancy, and the two beauties hugged each other, talking and laughing, which immediately made the men's eyes widen again, and they didn't know who to look at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he Alexander you often mention? Sir Stewart has also mentioned him several times. He is the developer of magic potions and beauty ointments. He is indeed a young and promising man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at Alexander with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander's daughter was injected with a genetic drug by Felix and is in danger of death. He came to avenge Felix. Felix has now teamed up with the Morris family and is currently in your Kaylon entertainment center."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see... If the Red Umbrella Group had allied with the Morris family, it will be difficult to deal with..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy frowned. She had guessed that Brittany wanted her help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was the leader of the Kaylon, her every word and action </span><span>was</span><span> related to the future of the Kaylon, so Nancy would not make a decision easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression was very solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am here to capture Felix. I hope you can give me some help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy pondered for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she smiled and said, "Maybe I can save your daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy said calmly, "If I'm not mistaken, Felix injected your daughter with an S-type genetic modification agent. According to the Red Umbrella Group's data, the mortality rate within a week of injecting this agent is 100%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And your daughter is still alive, so you must have a way to delay and suppress the evolution of cell mutation. If you have the secret treasure of the Kaylon as an aid, there is a high probability that you can help your daughter recover her health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Nancy's hand and asked, "What secret treasure do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's pretty face turned pale immediately. Alexander moved his hand just now and she was caught before she could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was a fight, she would have already lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy asked, shocked and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly let go and apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men are so impatient!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy rolled her eyes at him charmingly, and Alexander blushed, which was rare for him.</span></p></div>
