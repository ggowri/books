        <h1>Chapter 398 At a Loss</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt, leader of The Blood Gang, was one of the gang's strongest fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sharp gaze fell on Wyatt, mildly surprised; Wyatt was indeed a skilled fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be exact, Wyatt's abilities likely surpassed even those of Joseph and </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, putting him among the best Alexander had encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander was already an Intermediate Warrior, putting Wyatt far below him and not even in the same league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting, didn't expect to come across someone with this skill level," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander flashed a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary became increasingly nervous at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over, we're really in trouble...now what?" she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Alexander could fight, but Wyatt had both the numbers and was a true combat champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was at a loss, watching Alexander with a mix of worry and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw him calmly sipping his drink and even taking a bite of a snack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of all times, how could he still have the nerve to eat and drink?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was anxious, almost wanting to jump up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wyatt's right here, and you're eating? Are you insane?" she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied nonchalantly, "Well, it's your fault; I haven't even had breakfast yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary wasn't the only one speechless; everyone else was too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene began whining to Wyatt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Alexander just killed Lawrence using some dirty trick, then said he'd teach me a lesson and that The Blood Gang was nothing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene embellished his complaint as he glanced over at Alexander, who just kept eating and drinking without paying them any mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt's expression darkened as he listened to his son's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence was a representative of the Mafia Godfather, and he'd died right there in The Blood Gang's meeting. How was Wyatt supposed to explain this to Satan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept eating and drinking as he arrived. It was obvious he didn't take Wyatt seriously. If word of this got out, it would be an utter humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Wyatt ordered, leaving no room for negotiation, "Alexander, I'll give you a chance! Kneel down and bow three times, hand over the magic powder formula, and I might consider letting you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension spiked instantly as every eye turned to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, though the target of all the attention, continued eating and drinking as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, Alexander's really arrogant; that's our gang leader he's ignoring!" someone murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Alexander lose his mind? He's just eating," said another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he thinks he's done for and wants one last meal," someone speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Showing off in front of me, huh?" Wyatt huffed, displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved to the four men in black beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make him kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four men closed in on Alexander, their expressions vicious, like hyenas about to attack prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary quickly called out, "Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead man swung a brutal punch at Alexander's face, and if it hit, his nose would surely break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally put down his glass and caught the man's fist in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A mere lackey dares to strike at me?" he said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy voice seemed to carry a hypnotic power, echoing in everyone's ears, leaving their minds reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the other three reached Alexander, one of them pulling out a machete while another brandished a dagger, both swinging at him forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unleashed his Force and tossed them aside with a flick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black went flying sideways, slamming into his companions like a bowling ball and sending them crashing, screaming in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just one move, Wyatt's four followers were down for the count.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned as every one of Alexander's moves delivered an intense shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was nearly trembling with excitement, her chest heaving intensely, catching Alexander's eye for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's gaze linger on her chest, Mary blushed, feeling a rush of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Alexander exchange glances with Mary, Wyatt felt utterly humiliated, and his fury rose even higher!</span></p></div>
