        <h1>Chapter 249 Torture</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shortened the scepter and hid it, then deliberately flattered and ingratiated himself with the leading woman, Adara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Adara beat and insulted him, Guzman still clung to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara was overjoyed, thinking her charm had conquered Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a willing man could bring her an entirely different kind of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One night, Adara sent all the other women out to stand guard and patrol, leaving her alone in the cave, ready to enjoy herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman tried to plead, "Please, can you let me go? My father is the Godfather of the underworld. He has a lot of money. As long as you let me go back, I will give you enough money to last a lifetime, and you can enjoy endless wealth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara was actually beautiful and, due to regular exercise, had a sexy, well-proportioned figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, babe, I don't care if your father is the Godfather or whatever. Anyway, you have to stay here with me forever. If you can be nicer to me and obey me, I might consider giving you some freedom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman sneered inwardly. Since she wouldn't agree, he had to take a risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, my dear, I will definitely be good to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, preparing to let Adara completely let her guard down first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Babe, let's see how good you can be to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara caressed her chest coquettishly and crooked her finger at Guzman provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman mustered up his energy, suppressed his anger and disgust, and went over to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The water source in the cave was only enough for them to drink. How could they use it to bathe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't bathed for a while, and they were sweaty every day. Some dirt had even formed disgusting white patches on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman knelt and kissed Adara. The pungent smell almost made him vomit on the spot, but he still gritted his teeth and tried his best to endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must not die here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman hated his father. Why would he send him to this hellhole?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could have lived a life of wealth and luxury but was instead sent to this hellish place to suffer inhuman torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara couldn't wait any longer. She dragged Guzman over, only to find that he was still limp, with no response at all. She immediately became angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman apologized quickly, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry... It's been too frequent recently... I can't make it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body had been completely drained by these insatiable women, leaving him with no energy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara suddenly giggled coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. I have medicine. Come on. Take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Adara take out a few black aphrodisiac pills, Guzman almost collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking of his escape plan, Guzman gritted his teeth and swallowed the pills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Guzman so cooperative, Adara brightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the strong effect of the medicine, Guzman's member regained its vitality, looking very ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down on your knees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman shouted in anger, pressing Adara into a kneeling position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara was not angry but very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said coquettishly, "This is what a real man should be like. As long as you listen to me and treat me well, I can be in charge of restoring some of your personal freedom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman started his actions fiercely, venting his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adara couldn't help but moan. Guzman was exceptionally hardworking today, and she was about to come soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, babe... You are so good today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The uncontrollable joy overwhelmed Adara like a tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman, with a ferocious expression, vented all his accumulated anger and unwillingness, and his actions became increasingly violent and rough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Adara completely limp. She could only lie there and endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Guzman carefully reached for the scepter hidden nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adara, now that you won't let me go, just die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed the protrusion in the middle, and the scepter suddenly extended, piercing Adara's body.</span></p></div>
