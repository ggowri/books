        <h1>Chapter 11 I Call the Shots</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Mr. Augustine Hawthorne, according to the investigation," Alice replied hurriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity. I was actually quite keen on having him as my older brother, but it seems to be my wishful thinking. If Augustine wants me dead..." His lips curved. "I won't just wait for the axe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice frowned, uneasy flooded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine Hawthorne not only controls the Brilliant Group, but his men outnumber ours by several times. He also has a lot of die-hard loyalists..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved her off. "Don't worry about it. Handle your part. I'll deal with the rest myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice tried to persuade him, but Alexander cut her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough. I need a break. Make sure Ryan gets that ball invite tomorrow. Tell him we're celebrating his VP promotion. Let him enjoy the good news while it lasts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then his smile turned cruel. "Nothing hurts more than thinking you've made it, then watching it all burn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you wish, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice bent low, her curves entirely on display before Alexander's eyes. Her every movement exuded an irresistible allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew it well. She was clearly trying to seduce him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Always so aloof and professional, Alice," he said in a calm, measured tone. "Must be lonely behind those walls you've built."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words caught Alice off guard, and for a moment, her composure wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, aren't you having a rough day?" she said softly, her voice dripping with suggestive sweetness. "Let me help. I promise I'll be far better than Jane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took off her clothes, letting her perfect big boobs spill free, pink peaks hardening in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swallowed hard, his hands couldn't help but rise to grab and knead her breasts. They were soft and bouncy and felt wonderful in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice felt a tingle as if her body had been electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice shivered as electricity raced through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been ages since a man's touch, and her masturbator was a poor substitute for the real thing. She'd tried a few times to satisfy herself, but it just didn't feel the same. She needed a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since meeting Alexander, she'd developed a crush on him, growing strangely dependent on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his hands claimed her breasts, she surprisingly climaxed straight away, soaking wet between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, </span><span>please... </span><span>I want you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice moaned, her seductive and plump body rubbing against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sly grin spread across Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's be clear," he said, his voice laced with amusement. "You can't seduce me. I'm your master. I make the rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shoved Alice away, a flicker of disdain in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice stood frozen, shocked by the blunt rejection. It took her a moment to collect her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne's a tough one," she murmured to herself, a hint of admiration creeping into her frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Mr. Hawthorne. I will remember that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning on her heel, she sashayed out, her hips swaying rhythmically with each step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel his eyes burning into her back, but he still just remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of emptiness washed over Alice. For the first time in her life, she began to doubt her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's really special. Perhaps we won't lose after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poor Ryan, you're the first on his list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't wait to see how you end up! She thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alice left, Alexander sat cross-legged and entered a state of deep meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force flowed within him, surging and swelling, a mystical power projected from the starry expanse, piercing through the roof and enveloping Alexander's entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through a Warrior's refinement and absorption, this mystical star energy would become the Force that he could control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just star energy. All things in heaven and earth contained life force or other special powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Warrior could absorb and control these powers, making them a part of the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were eight levels of Warriors&mdash;Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, Master, Sovereign, Epic, and Legendary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cultivated his Force diligently through the night, immersing himself in the various techniques passed down by James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, the night had slipped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ring! Ring! Ring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's phone rang and vibrated insistently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squinted, fumbled for the phone, and barked into it, "Who the hell is calling? It's barely six in the morning! You just ruined my sleep..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Alice, Saint Group chairman's secretary," a crisp, pleasant voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan jolted awake. Even Jane sat up beside him, the sheets on her naked body falling away as she stared at the phone in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're really Ms. Hollister?" Ryan stammered, completely bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scam call?" Jane whispered. "Why would Saint Group call us at dawn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's eyes narrowed. He had no reason to be in contact with any executives from the Saint Group. Why would Alice seek him out at the crack of dawn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately flew into a rage. "Screw you! I'm the chairman of the Saint Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The angry voice blasted from the phone's speaker just as two red laser dots appeared on their foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sniper!" Ryan yelped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's body went rigid with fear, her bladder threatening to give out. One wrong move and her brains would paint the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh Ryan," Alice's voice dripped with icy amusement. "You should know about the Saint Group's background. We're not just about money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's forehead glistened with sweat, and he rose to wipe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I know," he stammered. "Everyone knows who's behind the Saint Group. The most powerful man in the world, Godfather!"</span></p></div>
