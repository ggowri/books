        <h1>Chapter 273 Dreaming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations, General, for winning such a stunning beauty like Ms. Fairfax!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's the General's charm, indeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people chimed in with compliments, while also being extremely polite to the Fairfax family, even trying to please them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder smirked with a sinister smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of woman was only suitable for a fling; his main intention was to use her to deal with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jane thought she and Schroder had fallen for each other at first sight. In front of the crowd, she nestled in his arms without any hint of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and the others immediately stood a little taller, suddenly feeling confident again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family was never considered a major force, repeatedly beaten down and </span><span>reduced to the status of nobodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they believed that Jane's connection with Schroder would bring them success and revive the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, quiet down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder raised his hand, signaling for silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd instantly fell silent, shifting their focus to Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've come to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> on behalf of the military for two reasons. First, to collaborate with Orion, the future head of the Hansen family, to establish a joint venture..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, the crowd erupted into an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's endorsement meant military support for Orion's claim to head the Hansen family, making him the clear heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion couldn't hide his excitement, his face beaming with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lara was pale, her hands tightly clenched, leaving deep marks on her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the Hansen family members quickly gathered around Orion, surrounding him like stars around the moon, seeing him as the future head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second reason is for the magic powder. I announce that from today, it will be a strategic reserve for the military, and no one is allowed to sell it without my permission!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's words struck like thunder, leaving everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd whispered among themselves, some happy, others worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who disliked Alexander and competed with the Saint Group grinned with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people present were agents or distributors of the magic powder, and they all glared at Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Schroder represented the military, he had already harmed their interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cutting off someone's income is like taking their lifeline!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder scanned the room, taking in everyone's expressions, and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic, everyone. I won't cancel the current agents or distributors for the magic powder. You'll be able to get supplies from the military."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people breathed a sigh of relief; as long as their profits weren't affected, it didn't matter to them who controlled the source of the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even began to gloat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That punk Alexander is finished. The military will definitely confiscate his formula."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, you can't be too arrogant. This is karma catching up with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the military involved, no matter how powerful Alexander is, he's got no way out now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Saint Group will have to behave now, instead of using its monopoly on magic powder to push us around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the chatter, everyone thought Alexander and the Saint Group were done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew burst into wild laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew that punk Alexander wouldn't have a good end. Karma has finally caught up with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth as if Alexander owed him millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane felt a mix of emotions. There was a hint of worry, but mostly she was gloating and feeling pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew nudged Jane, giving her a wild look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane quickly smiled and said, "General, if Alexander hands over the magic powder, could the Fairfax family become the exclusive distributor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! The Fairfax family isn't qualified to be the exclusive distributor of magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder cut her off impatiently, glaring at Jane with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to understand your position. I'm here representing the military. Do you want me to abuse my power publicly, giving others an excuse to attack me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face turned pale, and she quickly apologized, "General, I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to. Please forgive me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previously proud and arrogant Andrew and the rest of the Fairfax family suddenly deflated like burst balloons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion found it secretly amusing. To Schroder, this woman was just a plaything, yet she dared to dream of becoming the exclusive distributor of magic powder. What a delusion!</span></p></div>
