        <h1>Chapter 665 We Admit Defeat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, all of you, together, and stop dawdling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Alyssa warned her men, "Remember, this is just a sparring match. You must not injure Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They agreed loudly and then excitedly surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around him were laughing and talking, believing that so many of them could easily catch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his great fighting skills, he definitely couldn't handle dozens of people rushing towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're ready. Be careful!" Alyssa reminded Alexander again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get started. Don't waste any more time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander beckoned at them. It was too easy to deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that he didn't take them seriously, they got angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several strong men roared and charged at Alexander, relying on their numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others also darted towards him. Suddenly, they closed in on him, all yelling aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are too slow!" Alexander smiled contemptuously. He dodged and then disappeared from the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those men missed their target and glanced around in shock, searching for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no idea how he had passed through the crowd and got behind everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-Is this still the speed of a human? He's too fast. I can't see it clearly at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa couldn't help but curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her competitive spirit was fully aroused, and she soon ordered her men to surround Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too slow! Move faster. Faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved nimbly in and out of the crowd. No one could even touch him, let alone catch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were apparently dozens of people trying to capture him, but it turned out to be a farce. No matter how hard they tried, running and sweating, they could not reach him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout, Alexander did not make a move. He was relaxed and at ease, surrounded by dozens of people, as if he were playing a game.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, he patted some of them on the back of the head, shoulders, or vest, scaring them to jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was an actual combat, it meant they had been killed by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in chaos, running and panting, but they couldn't touch him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa finally couldn't help it and waved her hands with a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Everyone, stop. We can't catch up. Forget it. We admit defeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stopped, propped their knees on their hands, and bent over, gasping for breath, full of admiration for him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite knowing him as a formidable figure who had killed the leaders of two major forces in one night, they had never witnessed his strength personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, they personally experienced how powerful he was and were suddenly even more in awe of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been a real fight just now, they would have been wiped out long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, the friendly match is over. Let's have breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice pulled Alexander and then walked into the villa with Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just watched the whole game and laughed heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Xavier came downstairs, and the four of them chatted while eating breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa said to Alexander, "A new batch of ore will arrive today. Its quality is good. Maybe there will be top-grade gems. How about going there and taking a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He beamed with joy. He just came here for orange and purple top-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll definitely go!" Alexander agreed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Alyssa drove to an ore warehouse of the Axe with Alexander, Xavier, and Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the warehouse was an open-air storage area of more than 2.5 acres.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was surrounded by concrete walls more than ten feet high, with guard towers at intervals and electric fences hanging from the walls.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with the 24-hour surveillance cameras and dozens of heavily armed guards, the warehouse was unbreakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of heavy trucks carrying gemstone ores of all shapes and sizes were being unloaded on the grounds, stirring up a cloud of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was quite surprised to see so many ores for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His All-seeing Eyes swept over and immediately found glowing ores everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many ores contain gems, even high-grade ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alyssa had said, the batch of new ores from the mine was indeed of high quality.</span></p></div>
