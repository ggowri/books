        <h1>Chapter 623 Unbelievable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grinding wheel spun rapidly, and the ore had just been ground for less than ten seconds, but everyone saw a dazzling green light appear and burst out from the crushed stone chips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was indeed a gem in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, staring at the ore with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God! Such a bright green light! Could this be a top-grade emerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible. Such a large piece of top-grade emerald would cost hundreds of millions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop grinding it. I'll give you 30 million dollars. Just sell this ore to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty million dollars? I'm willing to buy it for fifty million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people became excited and started bidding to grab the ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, you'd better not cut it completely open. What if the gem inside is not top-grade, but just high-grade? Sell it to me for fifty million dollars." Someone said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were even more anxious than Alexander, and they couldn't wait to snatch the stone away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though someone had offered a high price of fifty million dollars, Alexander ignored them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member ground it carefully, fearing that the grinder would damage the gem inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also very excited to be able to grind a top-grade gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gathered together, staring at it and talking excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's face looked very ugly. He prayed in his heart, hoping that there was no high-grade gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the outer shell of the ore was worn away, leaving only a green stone the size of an egg inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both its luster and texture showed that it was a natural emerald. After being polished, it would emit an even brighter light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member took out a flashlight and shone it on the emerald a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lush green glow radiated, making people intoxicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was silent. This was a top-grade emerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan fell to the ground with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought he was sure to win, but he didn't expect to lose so badly. His body became limp uncontrollably, and he couldn't get up after struggling several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Evan with pity. He lost the exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transaction commission of this underground exchange was over one million every month, which was very valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Rose Market was a good place to collect intelligence. Otherwise, the Mafia wouldn't have set their sights on this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan would be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he spent thirty million dollars to buy a scrap mine, and now he lost the exchange. Mafia wouldn't forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged jeweler said to Alexander excitedly, "Sir, please sell this gem to me. I'll give you sixty million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand and refused directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this top-grade emerald, he only lacked orange and purple top-grade gems. With seven colors of gems in total, he could upgrade the Lightsabers to level two, greatly increasing its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, no matter how much money others offered, he would not sell it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Evan wanted to sneak away secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed him and said, "You want to run away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's eyes were filled with despair and resentment, and he stared at Alexander viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tate, you can't run away. The exchange is mine now. Sign it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large group of men in black rushed in from outside, surrounding the entrance and exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty twisted her waist and handed an agreement to Alexander with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she looked at Olivia a few times and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Olivia was very nervous. Her palms were sweaty, and she couldn't help trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan gnashed his teeth and said, "So you are from Ultimate Alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mafia members all looked pale. Faced with enemies with absolute superiority, they dared not resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you still want to live, just sign it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander threw the agreement in Evan's face.</span></p></div>
