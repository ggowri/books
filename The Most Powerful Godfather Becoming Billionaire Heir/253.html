        <h1>Chapter 253 Be Discovered</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, look carefully. This is what happens when you betray me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman swung Ancestral Witch's Cane and killed Jack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood gushed out like a spring and was quickly absorbed by Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack, however, still roared and yelled with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at him with complicated expressions. A hint of sympathy and pity flashed in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because they gathered in front of Ancestral Witch's Cane, they all received some life energy, and they were very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman stabbed Jack fiercely with Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, all of Jack's blood was drained out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack was no longer moving. His body was curled up like a shrimp and becoming increasingly shriveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Guzman did not stop. He continued to stab him fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack was covered in blood, with more than a dozen holes on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Guzman raised the Ancestral Witch's Cane and stabbed it hard towards Jack's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp end of the Cane pierced deeply and then pulled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no blood flowing out. Jack opened his mouth wide, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dare to insult me? This is the cost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman looked crazy. He raised Ancestral Witch's Cane high up, and everyone cheered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack spat out blood and closed his eyes with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A line of blood extended from the end of the Cane that pierced Jack's body and sank into Guzman's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman was in high spirits. He felt that his physical fitness had improved a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the life energy of his relatives, which could be better absorbed and utilized. Guzman felt extremely relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He straightened up. The number of wrinkles on his face became less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, most of Cloe's blood had already flowed out. Although she was not dead yet, she could only lie on the ground powerlessly, looking at her devilish adoptive father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, when your last drop of blood dries up, I will surely be able to successfully advance to a white wizard under the glory of Witch God. By then, City of Sorcery will regard me as its master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander will die and the Red Umbrella Group will be destroyed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman said with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His originally brown eyes turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people knelt down before Guzman with extremely pious expressions on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman raised his head with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I know you are hiding in the dark. Why don't you come out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman used Ancestral Witch's Cane to point at the ceiling where Alexander was hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was shocked. He didn't expect that he would be discovered by Guzman. This was the first time he was caught. He felt that Guzman was powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't afraid. He no longer hid and jumped down from the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Guzman saw Alexander, he was startled at first. Then, he grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smile was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a sense of crisis and even his heartbeat quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't felt this insecure in a long time since he became a Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I didn't expect that you would come here. John told you, right? John deserves to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman smiled and looked Alexander with greedy eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If this half-brother could be sacrificed, it would definitely greatly please the Witch God.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I will be a white wizard quickly. I might be a higher level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you are really a talent. We are brothers. What a pity..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman looked like he could control everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I'm here, only one of us can survive today. Use whatever tricks you have. I'll take them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, you are too arrogant! I wanted to let you die without pain, but you are forcing me to torture you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guzman became ruthless, and he waved Ancestral Witch's Cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disable his hands first!"</span></p></div>
