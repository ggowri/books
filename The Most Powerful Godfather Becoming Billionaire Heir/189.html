        <h1>Chapter 189 Surrender</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian gritted his teeth, forcing himself to steady his nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're strong, I'll give you that. But this is the </span><span>era </span><span>of technology. No matter how tough you are, </span><span>you can</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t escape</span><span> a bullet</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the words even left his mouth, Ian pulled out his gun and fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian shot twice, and with only about 6 feet separating them, he couldn't believe Alexander would survive this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin felt a chill run down their spines. They hadn't expected Ian to have a gun, let alone to use it </span><span>in a blink of eye</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such</span><span> close</span><span> a</span><span> </span><span>distance</span><span>, no one could dodge a bullet</span><span>. After all, </span><span>this wasn't some action movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smug grin spread across Ian's face as he pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in an instant, Alexander moved like a ghost, effortlessly dodging the bullets and seizing Ian's wrist in a vice-like grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crack, Ian's gun clattered to the ground as he screamed in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! How did you </span><span>do that</span><span>?" he gasped, clutching his hand in </span><span>sharp pain</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander yanked </span><span>and</span><span> dragg</span><span>ed</span><span> him like a rag doll toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>From now on</span><span>, there will be no Fraternity in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please! Don't kill me... I </span><span>give up</span><span>, I surrender! I'll do anything, just don't kill me!" Ian begged</span><span> in terror</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fraternity members in the hallway stood frozen, </span><span>looking at </span><span>their boss&mdash;who had always been </span><span>aggressive</span><span>&mdash;now crying like a child. It was a shocking sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You</span><span> want </span><span>to surrender?" Alexander asked, a teasing smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes! I'll surrender! Whatever you want, I'll do it! Just don't kill me</span><span>, </span><span>please</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian sounded like a scared child caught doing something wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian, </span><span>unconvinced by </span><span>Alexander</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s power</span><span>, shouted, "Ian, don't be afraid of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all here; he wouldn't dare do anything to you! He</span><span> can</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t afford to be sent to</span><span> jail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s anger flared and shouted at her,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, you foolish woman!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Lillian</span><span> </span><span>continued, "I'm calling the cops! I'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut </span><span>up</span><span>, or I'll have someone take you out!" Ian bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian flinched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back to Alexander, Ian pleaded, "Please, don't kill me! I'll do whatever you want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have </span><span>men</span><span>, money, territory&mdash;I'm useful to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, contemplating. If Ian was willing to cooperate, he could use the Force to control him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would allow him to secretly absorb the entire Fraternity, benefiting his larger plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta interjected, "Boss, he's definitely trying to play us. He's just stalling for time. We should take him out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin glared at Ian, ready to pounce at Alexander's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, Alexander picked up Ian's gun, pointing the dark muzzle at Ian's forehead </span><span>with an amused expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, relax and swear to serve me faithfully from now on.</span><span> Y</span><span>ou won't live</span><span> if you b</span><span>etray me</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat dripped down Ian's forehead as he nodded frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay! I swear! I'll do it right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself </span><span>down</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle pat on Ian's shoulder, Alexander subtly infused the Force into Ian's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Ian, in front of everyone here, swear to serve you faithfully..." Ian began earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the Force surged within </span><span>his brain</span><span>, subtly shifting his mental state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian had no resistance in mind, and with Alexander's recent substantial improvements in strength, the </span><span>manipulation went well</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ian began his oath, he was initially dismissive, just as Augusta had predicted, only wanting to get through this ordeal and then find a way to exact his revenge on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the oath was complete, however, Ian's mind was </span><span>completely</span><span> under the control of the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alexander with </span><span>great</span><span> sincerity. "Boss, I'm sorry for everything. From today on, I'll atone for my </span><span>mistakes</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin were stunned, exchanging bewildered glances. "He's </span><span>serious</span><span>?" they wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fraternity members were </span><span>also</span><span> </span><span>confused. They didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t understand </span><span>how did Alexander</span><span> became</span><span> their own boss</span><span> in </span><span>a</span><span> instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, some of them couldn't suppress their excitement, for the </span><span>generous</span><span> benefits promised by the Ultimate Alliance had long been the subject of their envy.</span></p></div>
