        <h1>Chapter 1366 The Gap Is Too Wide</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fay was short and stout, his beady eyes gleaming with shrewdness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortune favors the bold. I heard Alexander has fought against a level-four warrior from Risun before. If this bet goes my way, haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin chuckled and shook his head helplessly. He actually hoped Fay was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde shot a glance at Alexander, clenched her teeth, and pulled out a stack of banknotes. She whispered a few words to Lana, who took the notes and hurried off to place a bet...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huxley let out a hearty laugh. "That Alexander is interesting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan fanned himself gently, smiling without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, no one was paying attention to the bronze platform. The crowd had surged toward the silver-rank arena. Seeing that no one was left to challenge him, Hogan hopped off the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Rhodes exchanged respectful gestures before the match. Rhodes put on a show of generosity, flashing a sly smirk as he made a gesture of invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander steadied his breath, the Force within him swirling fiercely. With a sharp battle cry, he sprang forward, his body coiling like a drawn bow and his fist launching like an arrow, tearing through the air as he shot toward Rhodes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes sneered with disdain and took a sudden step forward. His speed was astonishing. Before Alexander could react, he was already at his side. Both arms, sharp as gleaming swords, slashed toward Alexander's head and throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt as if an icy mountain was crashing down on him, sending a suffocating chill straight for his vital points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force within him suddenly reversed. A mouthful of blood spewed out, but against all odds, Alexander twisted his body, redirecting Rhodes' attack and deflecting both arms away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes was stunned, thinking, "A level-three warrior just nullified the force of a level-four warrior's attack? Impossible. He's got some skill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the stage, Logan and the others turned pale when they saw Alexander coughing up blood after the first move. Meanwhile, Julius was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander's combat power is 990. That demon Rhodes is at 3,290. The gap is way too big!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan felt his heart pounding with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' arms surged with silver protective energy, turning them into blades of pure force. Silent as a ghost, he swung them downward toward Alexander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gritted his teeth and refused to dodge. He pushed the Force vortex to its limit, his spine arching like a coiled dragon before snapping back. His body twisted, and his fist was like a divine hammer, roaring with wind and thunder as it smashed toward Rhodes' throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp glint flashed in Rhodes' eyes. He let out a cold snort, lifted his left arm, and traced an eerie arc with his right hand, striking directly at Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burst of silver sword energy exploded.&nbsp;Crack!&nbsp;A few of Alexander's ribs snapped, and blood gushed from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking expression flickered across Rhodes' face before vanishing.&nbsp;"It's over,"&nbsp;he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands moved like dancing swords, filling the air with an icy, lethal aura. He was about to cut Alexander to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the mysterious golden energy in Alexander's chest erupted, radiating waves of scorching heat like the sun. The force of the Docpirin surged through his body, filling every inch of him with revitalizing power.&nbsp;What a rush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved. He could feel the golden energy pulsing with an unprecedented fighting spirit.&nbsp;"You want me dead? Then I'll take you down with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body surged with a brilliant blue protective energy. With movements as fluid as a serpent, he slithered into Rhodes' space. His right arm locked Rhodes in a crushing grip, while his left fist, like a hammer of destruction, struck Rhodes' waist with a thunderous crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes was horrified.&nbsp;"He can still move? I underestimated him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body trembled. Silver protective energy and freezing sword intent exploded outward as his elbow, sharp as a blade, stabbed straight for Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectators below and the officials on the viewing platform were all dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding silver light clashed against a dazzling blue aura. In the blink of an eye, they exchanged blows multiple times. Alexander was coughing up blood, yet he neither flew off the stage nor collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two had practically tangled together, almost rolling across the ground like a pair of wrestlers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was shocked. A level-four warrior at his peak had undergone a complete transformation. His bones were as tough as refined steel, his body moving as fast as his intent. On top of that, Rhodes had mastered the essence of the Way of the Sword, wielding boundless power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, he still hasn't taken down a level-three warrior like Alexander...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a bone-chilling force stabbing toward his back. He knew that if it came down to speed, he was as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he made a desperate decision. He concentrated all his protective energy into his back and arms, refusing to dodge. Instead, he held onto Rhodes with all his strength and hammered away with his right fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' elbow struck Alexander's back, and the sword energy pierced straight through, stabbing at his heart. Alexander's body instantly froze over, and blood poured from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the golden energy in Alexander's chest stirred. The terrifyingly cold sword intent was absorbed, vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' face twisted in shock.&nbsp;"My ultimate sword intent struck his heart, and he's still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' waist took several devastating punches, causing his internal energy to spiral out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander roared, "I still have five moves left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His arms surged with energy as he locked Rhodes in an iron grip, lifting him high, ready to slam him into the ground.</span></p></div>
