        <h1>Chapter 188 Overwhelming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! I thought you were something special, but turns out you're just trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ewan laughed triumphantly, fully expecting to knock Alexander flat on his back in the next moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a flash, Alexander simply smiled, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ants are still ants, utterly foolish," he said, his voice calm and steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift movement, he reached out and caught Ewan's fist in his hand like a lightning bolt striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the onlookers, it seemed almost leisurely, but in reality, it was as fast as a flash of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ewan's expression shifted from confidence to shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was his strongest punch, one that could easily smash through a door, yet Alexander </span><span>took</span><span> it with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander tightened his grip, Ewan felt as if a massive iron band was crushing his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of cracking knuckles filled the air, and a sharp pain shot through him, unbearable and intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to bear it any longer, Ewan let out a scream that echoed through the room like a tenor hitting a high note.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Fraternity stood frozen in disbelief, while Ian's heart raced with fear. He</span><span> </span><span>took several steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ewan was one of the top fighters in the Fraternity, and yet here he was, injured by Alexander in one swift move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by Ewan's twisted hand, it was clear: he was done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you've got some skills; no wonder you're so cocky. But thinking you can run wild in the Fraternity with just your strength? That's naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got over a hundred men outside. We</span><span> can just</span><span> bury you," Ian shouted, trying to maintain a facade of bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shot Ian a cold smile, his demeanor sending chills down Ian's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is just the beginning. You bring as many as you want; I'll take them all down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful kick, Alexander sent Ewan flying across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed into the wall like a cannonball, hitting the ground and lying motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole room shook from the impact, causing Lillian to scream in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian rushed over to Ewan</span><span>. He shouted in panic</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ewan! Are you okay? Please, say something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ewan was Ian's most loyal </span><span>helper</span><span>, a key player in the Fraternity's hold on </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. To see him so easily </span><span>destroyed</span><span> by Alexander was a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood streamed from Ewan's mouth as he struggled to speak, his breath ragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing Ewan was on the brink of </span><span>death</span><span>, Ian roared, "You bastard, Alexander! You hurt my buddy; you'll pay for this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get him! What are you waiting for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian felt as though his dignity had been mercilessly trampled under Alexander's heel, and he knew he couldn't let this grudge go unpunished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen or so men in the room surged forward like a pack of wolves, howling as they charged at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander had displayed remarkable skills, his opponents were emboldened </span><span>by their numbers. They figured that even if it came down to sheer </span><span>number</span><span>, they could overwhelm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander stood </span><span>there</span><span>. Suddenly, he spun around </span><span>and</span><span> left everyone dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the chaos, the attackers couldn't even see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They crashed into him like waves breaking against rocks, collapsing to the ground with broken bones and cries of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, they swarmed Alexander, launching a coordinated attack, while outside, more and more people rushed in, eager to join the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin held the entrance, fending off anyone who dared to step inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the attackers fell, rolling on the ground and howling in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fury at the Fraternity for injuring his men fueled his strength. He didn't hold back; those who survived would be left crippled for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entrance was littered with bodies, thanks to Augusta and Marvin's relentless teamwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can so many people not take him down? Is he some kind of demon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's eyes were wide with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian felt like he was standing on the edge of a cliff. Despite having overwhelming numbers, he was crushed by Alexander and his two allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ones inside </span><span>the room </span><span>were incapacitated, and those outside couldn't break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Ian the most was Alexander's ruthless nature&mdash;something he had never </span><span>expected</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of what awaited him at Alexander's hands sent shivers down Ian's spine, leaving him drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode confidently up to Ian, his demeanor dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your turn now. Have you figured out how you want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Ian fell silent, and an oppressive stillness enveloped the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those in the hallway hesitated to </span><span>break in</span><span>, staring wide-eyed at Alexander with a mix of shock and fear.</span></p></div>
