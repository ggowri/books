        <h1>Chapter 350 Go to Hell</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley seized the girl by the hand and caressed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "I won't charge you any money in the future, but your daughter has to sleep with me. It's a pity that such a beautiful girl has to suffer with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, the girl burst into tears and struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! Let go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man came back to his senses, grabbed the fruit knife, and stabbed Wesley's arm hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!" Wesley screamed, blood dripping from his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl took the opportunity to break free and hid behind her father. Her rosy face was now pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you stab me with a knife? Damn it, you're courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley got furious and ordered his men to overturn the elderly man's cart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The food and change on the cart were scattered all over the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man ignored his cart and backed away, holding the fruit knife to protect his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastards, you deserve to go to hell. God will definitely punish you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole, you injured and cursed me. Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his rage, Wesley pulled out his gun, aimed at the elderly man, and shot him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a gunshot rang out, many people closed their eyes. They couldn't bear to see the elderly man's blood splattered on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, to the surprise of some, Wesley's hand holding the gun was seized by a handsome young man, and the shot missed.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? Let go of me if you don't want to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley threatened Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried with all his strength to free himself from Alexander's grasp, but it was all in vain.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you to let go!" Wesley roared and attempted to punch Alexander in the nose with his left fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was countless times faster than him. As soon as Wesley's left hand moved, Alexander grabbed his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley felt as if his hand was being strained by an iron hoop, causing him excruciating pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch! It hurts! Let go. Please let go of me..." Wesley screamed bitterly. He heard the crisp sound of bones breaking in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued to tighten his grip and sneered, "You bastard, do you feel any pain? You are unworthy of being a human. Go to hell and be a slave of the devil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he added a little more strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!" Wesley wailed in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of our boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, are you asking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's men confronted Alexander arrogantly and, relying on their large numbers, rushed forward to defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first guy just moved closer and immediately felt a sharp pang in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if he had been hit by a speeding heavy tank, he went flying upside down through the crowd and landed hard on the ground.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked the guy away so fast that no one could see his actions clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, two more hooligans flew out and lay prone on the ground, unable to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up the knives and forks on the table and threw them at the other hooligans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knives and forks shot out, each hitting a hooligan accurately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were stabbed in the thigh, others in the abdomen, and some, covering their bleeding shoulders, collapsed to the ground, wailing.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all of Wesley's men were struck down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch! Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was in a great deal of pain, for his right hand had been clung to by Alexander.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It twisted into a horrible shape and turned black and blue due to extreme lack of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong. I was wrong... I'm sorry. Please let me off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley begged Alexander for mercy again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him with a deadpan, murderous expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a bastard. If you die, it will be a blessing to the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was almost frightened to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no longer as arrogant as before, and he pleaded with tears, "Sir, please let me off. I know I was wrong, and I will never do it again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the elderly man carefully advised, "Thank you. How about letting him off? After all, he's always been a bully on this street. We are ordinary people, and we can't afford to offend him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid that if Alexander left, Wesley would take revenge on him, and there would really be no way for him to survive.</span></p></div>
