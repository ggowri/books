        <h1>Chapter 1181 Show Yourself</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young women serving the dishes all looked over, their expressions filled with dissatisfaction and disdain, believing that Alexander had never seen the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually said Mr. </span><span>Clement's</span><span> food wasn't that great?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clement is a descendant of royal chefs. He must be deliberately slandering him out of jealousy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for our rules, I would really want to kick him out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few women whispered among themselves, extremely displeased with Alexander's earlier evaluation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you saying? What do you mean?" Cloe's expression changed as she glared at them in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager sneered and said, "Ms. Cloe Bryant, I'm sorry. We can understand that someone may not like the dishes. Perhaps he hasn't had good food before. But it's indeed a pity to waste the hard work Mr. Clement put into making these meals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe slammed her hand on the table. "Enough! Is this how you treat guests? Watch your attitude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall manager retorted, "Ms. Cloe Bryant, it was this gentleman who insulted Mr. Clement first. You can't just twist the facts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up. I see you need a lesson," William shouted, ready to slap the manager, but was stopped by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. We came for food."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William huffed, "My boss thinks it doesn't taste good, and I think it doesn't taste good either. Can't we express our opinions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan chimed in sarcastically, "You are too arrogant. Whether the food tastes good or not is the guest's business. Do you think you can control that? Forcing us to give a positive review, is that it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander hadn't intervened, the clueless hall manager would have definitely ended up on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you arguing about? Why aren't you properly serving the guests?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An angry voice came from a middle-aged man as a gray-haired man in a chef's outfit walked out from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dressed like a chef and carried a faint smell of cooking oil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clement, this guest says your dishes aren't good," the manager reported quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles frowned slightly and calmly said, "Dear guests, I welcome you to dine here, but I don't understand why there's a quarrel. If you are dissatisfied with the dishes, you can provide constructive feedback. There's no need to trouble others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I consider my cooking skills to be decent, but I'm also willing to learn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles appeared polite, but he was actually questioning Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander completely ignored Dulles. With his current status, this so-called descendant of a royal chef was nothing more than an insignificant insect to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles, feeling indignant, stepped closer to Alexander and asked, "Sir, may I know your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William glared fiercely at Dulles. "This is my boss. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles' expression changed instantly. He knew William was one of the senior managers of Treasure Island. Therefore, Alexander's status must be even more exalted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander wanted to make trouble for him, his restaurant wouldn't be able to operate on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles had come to Treasure Island to open a restaurant because he had offended enemies and couldn't survive in his own country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The residents of Treasure Island had strong purchasing power, allowing Dulles to recoup his costs and make a significant profit in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles forced a smile and stretched out his hand to Alexander. "So, you're Mr. Hawthorne. It's a pleasure to meet you. May I ask what shortcomings my dishes have? I will certainly improve. I'm truly sorry if I didn't meet your expectations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions of the hall manager and the servers changed. Dulles was someone they regarded as unafraid of power, yet his attitude had shifted so quickly this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Dulles and smiled slightly, "Mr. Clement, your dishes aren't really that bad. They're okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles' mouth twitched in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please be direct. I will make improvements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles' attitude seemed very humble, but in reality, it was a tactical retreat, wanting Alexander to realize that his cooking skills were not something everyone could question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering for a moment, Alexander said, "If full marks are a hundred, I would give you eighty. I don't mean to undermine you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more Alexander talked like this, the more Dulles felt it grated on his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally unable to contain himself, Dulles smiled and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, it seems you are a gourmet. Then I suppose </span><span>your</span><span> cooking must be better than mine. How about you show us your skills?"</span></p></div>
