        <h1>Chapter 800 Consequences</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If possible, Zora would have loved to shoot Alexander on the spot. But with more than half of her men already lost in Loscity, she no longer dared to act so recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, Ms. Jared, aren't you going to invite me in?" Alexander smiled harmlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She replied, "Welcome, Mr. Hawthorne. Please come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them entered the villa together, smiling as if they were old friends who hadn't seen each other in years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Alexander sat down on the sofa, eight men in black suddenly rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They surrounded Alexander, glaring at him like wolves ready to pounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Jared, what is the meaning of this?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only when seeing Alexander surrounded did Zora let out a sigh of relief and allow herself to smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She replied, "Mr. Hawthorne, let's be direct. What did you do to my men?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tone turned cold, as Alexander was trapped, and there was no need to hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander suddenly burst into laughter as if he had just heard the funniest joke in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Jared, do you think I'm stupid enough to walk into your den alone? Are you planning to kill me now?" he smirked, glancing at those men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chills crept up their spines, and they instinctively took two steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora was oblivious to their reactions. She chuckled darkly, "Alexander, you're far too careless. You must have thought I was alone, but unlike you, I'm a very cautious person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter what you've done to my men, you're in my hands now. The advantage is mine, so you'd better behave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slapped the table hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander asked, still smiling, "And what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Growing smug, Zora crossed her legs, revealing almost her entire thigh and even a bit more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, she was wearing something scandalous or perhaps nothing at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, you're not as fearsome as the rumors say. Ha. Now, we can have a nice little chat. If you can't meet my demands, the consequences will be severe." She threatened, pleased with herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then, go ahead. What do you want to talk about?" Alexander mirrored her, crossing his legs with a smile that turned slightly cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I came to Loscity with a simple goal. Hand over the formula for the magic powder to the Dragon Gang, and we'll ally with you to take on the Sakura Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way, you won't have to worry about your safety. Trading a formula for your life seems more than fair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dropping her pretense, she let her greedy expression show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Alexander under control, she no longer needed to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Ms. Jared, I should thank you. I had no idea that the Dragon Gang was here to ally with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora lifted her head proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Of course. The Dragon Gang and the Sakura Society are sworn enemies. You're quite lucky to have caught our attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So? Will you hand over the formula?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave her a contemptuous look. "Do you think these few men could do anything to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Are you still defiant?" Zora slapped the table again. "Alexander, you'll either hand over the formula today or die here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She exuded confidence, issuing her death threats as if everything was under her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sprang to his feet, and the eight men immediately blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air immediately grew tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Zora failed to notice those guards' pale faces and their trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sneering, she mocked him, "Alexander, do you think you can take on all eight of them and turn the tables?"</span></p></div>
