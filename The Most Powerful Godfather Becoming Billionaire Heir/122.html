        <h1>Chapter 122 The Ban</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was overjoyed, barely able to believe everything was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> from The Cripples was the first to react, his face stern. "Mr. Sebastian Tate, since the Brilliant Group isn't the exclusive distributor, we'll no longer be working with you. The Saint Group is the only viable partner for The Cripples."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned and, with a bright smile, greeted Alexander and Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honored Mr. Hawthorne, Ms. Blackburn, The Cripples are eager to ally with the Saint Group and work together toward a prosperous future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing The Cripples switch sides, Mary from The Blood Gang quickly walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she drew near, her perfume filled the air, and her ample figure nearly pressed against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed up at him with sultry eyes, her expression laced with flirtation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, The Blood Gang would also like to form an alliance with the Saint Group. And if Ms. Blackburn doesn't mind, perhaps you could visit me some</span><span> </span><span>time," she purred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's smile instantly faded at Mary's suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Ms. Moore, thank you for the invitation. If you're serious about discussing business, we can meet at the office another day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only smile awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was well-known around </span><span>Loscity</span><span> as an incorrigible flirt, always surrounded by a rotating cast of admirers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't just handsome; he now held the formula for magic powder. It was no surprise Mary had set her sights on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Ava's obvious hostility, Mary just laughed, her lush figure trembling as she covered her mouth daintily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Refund us! The Brilliant Group has no claim as a distributor; why should I pay them as a city-level agent? I want my money back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I already paid; I want a refund too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group began to surround Sebastian, shouting angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's fury flared. His newly formed alliances were crumbling in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, unable to handle the shock, shouted in a frenzied voice, "It's a scam! Alexander is lying; this isn't real magic powder, it's fake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane bitterly interjected, "Betty, are you and Alexander in on this together? Did you kidnap Mr. Gellar and then bring in a batch of counterfeit powder to cheat us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of hope flashed in Sebastian's eyes. This seemed possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-bustling conference hall fell silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, who had been quiet, finally spoke with a dark expression, "It's true; this shipment needs to be verified. Jackson might have been fake, but this load Alexander brought might be fake too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His statement immediately drew support. Many saw Alexander as a failure, incapable of creating something as revolutionary as magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I want to invite Mr. Hartmann, Ms. Moore, Sir Stewart, and Ms. Hansen to verify this magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>'s heart raced, startled to hear Alexander call her name. She understood he was doing this to counter Orion's accusations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't hesitate and joined the other three by the truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured for them to select samples as they wished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four chose several bags at random and began opening them in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as each package was opened, the distinct aroma of magic powder filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took deep breaths, feeling an immediate surge of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's face lit up with excitement, and he burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's magic powder, and it's even better quality than before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> nodded enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This batch is top-tier. Mr. Hawthorne, Ms. Blackburn, how about selling this entire load to me at a high price? I'll take it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, do you think you can just ignore The Kaylon?" Oscar retorted, visibly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary scoffed. "</span><span>Houtte</span><span>, you think you can handle it all yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in astonishment as the major players squabbled over the goods, finally understanding that the entire truckload of magic powder was indeed authentic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Saint Group holds exclusive rights. If anyone wants to secure a state or city-level distribution partnership, we're open to discussing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have one condition. Those who wish to distribute magic powder must ally themselves with the Saint Group. We'll move forward together, and as one, we'll block the Brilliant Group from all business."</span></p></div>
