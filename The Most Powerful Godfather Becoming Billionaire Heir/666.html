        <h1>Chapter 666 Inconceivable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the largest ore warehouse of the Axe. We don't have so many ores normally. I gathered the ores from the Glory Association and Southern Mining together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, the batch of ores were all dug out from rich mines. They are of high quality and must contain a lot of gemstones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa introduced the situation to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier suddenly became excited. The story of Alexander cutting out top-grade gems had already spread, and he had been looking forward to seeing it with his own eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, dozens of heavy trucks unloaded the ores.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked over calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier stared wide-eyed at the dense assortment of ores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He touched and observed them, selecting ores based on his experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's All-seeing Eyes swept over, ruling out a vast expanse of useless ores and zeroing in on those that gave off more intense light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, there were hundreds of ores of various shapes on the scene, emitting strong light and containing high-quality gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander examined each piece with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though powerful, his All-seeing Eyes couldn't clearly distinguish hundreds of pieces of ore at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held an electric saw in his hand and cut a piece of ore himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A solid red light flashed, and a crystal-clear ruby appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for a few tiny impurities in it, the gem would definitely be top-grade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, the high-grade ruby could definitely be sold for millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa and the others didn't care at first, thinking that it would be impossible for Alexander to cut the gem on his first attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their surprise, it was a success. The first piece of ore contained high-quality ruby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be luck. He's lucky..." Alyssa murmured to herself with mixed feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone followed Alexander and watched him cut the stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he cut open ore, there were gems inside. At the very least, it was a gem worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and there was a bunch of gems worth millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa counted and found that Alexander had tried more than twenty times and hadn't </span><span>failed once. It was simply a miracle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, he had cut more than fifty pieces of ore, and behind him, she had a blank mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly dawned on her that she didn't know him well enough. He was simply a god-like man who always shocked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the members of the Axe even thought they were dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone slapped himself in the face, trying to wake himself up from the dream, but it didn't work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept cutting into the ore and discovering high-quality gems, which dumbfounded them greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were not in the gem business, they would definitely assume that finding gems was easy and that everyone could make a fortune out of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most people would fail, and almost everyone who bet on the stone speculation would go bankrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was inconceivable that Alexander broke their perceptions and completely reversed common sense.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cut another piece of ore, from which he obtained a yellow gemstone the size of his little finger.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though disappointed that he didn't find top-grade gems, he was still very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandale</span><span> Town was indeed home to world-famous gem mines. The quality of these ores was really excellent, far superior to those seen elsewhere, and the chances of cutting out the gems were many times greater.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was natural. The ores pulled out from the gem mines and sold to other cities had undergone at least one or several selections, and the number of ores containing gems was much less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Alexander obtained more than one hundred gems, all of which were of very good quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could be carved into magic circles, amulets, and other uses. They were very important to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Ship them all back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, and the cost will be deducted from my dividend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa nodded repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, and it cost nothing. As a senior executive of the Axe, the stone cutting is free. And you have helped us so much. Without you, even the Axe would have been destroyed, and we couldn't have got these ores."</span></p></div>
