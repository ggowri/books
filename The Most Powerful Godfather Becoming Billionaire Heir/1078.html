        <h1>Chapter 1078 Get Out of My Face</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what are you all standing around for? Get them! Seize them all!" Lanny stammered out his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corporate security guards immediately surrounded Alexander and the other two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes were filled with glistening tears that instantly spilled down her cheeks. Her lips trembled as she pleaded, "Run! I'll hold them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a confident smile. "Don't worry, ma'am. I'll protect you both. Let's find somewhere more private to talk this through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we even get out of here?" Emma stared at Alexander in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry. Alexander's fighting skills are incredible. They don't stand a chance against him," Maxine rushed to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes widened with a mix of shock and hope as she focused on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lanny stepped forward, pointing at Alexander with arrogant contempt. "Hey punk, do you even know where you are? You dare try to steal a woman from Silver Shield Security? Got a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way," Alexander replied icily. "Don't make me do this the hard way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! You're asking for </span><span>death</span><span>!" Lanny, already seething from the earlier confrontation, completely lost his composure. "Grab them all!" he snarled through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two security guards reached for Alexander. "Back off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just those few words, Alexander swung his hand in a devastating slap. The guards went flying with screams of pain, crashing hard onto the ground. Each coughed up a mouthful of blood, along with several teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's foot slammed into Lanny's chest before the remaining security guards could even react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being over six feet tall and nearly 220 pounds, Lanny went flying backward from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other guards froze in terror, staring blankly, too scared to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let</span><span> them go for now</span><span>," one of them muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander escorted the mother and daughter to his car and drove away swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, ma'am," he said as he drove. "Since they're after Mr. Duncan's technology, they won't harm him for now. I'll get you both somewhere safe first, then </span><span>I&rsquo;ll go to</span><span> rescue Mr. Duncan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma suddenly burst into tears with a loud sob. "Thank you... If you can really </span><span>save </span><span>my husband, you'll be our family's savior..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry." Maxine hugged Emma comfortingly. "Alexander will make it happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Emma let out a deep sigh. "Your father worked so hard on his research, trying to give us a better life. He finally achieved a breakthrough, but we never imagined Silver Shield Security would stoop so low."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry," Maxine said, her eyes glistening with tears. "Alexander will </span><span>definitely rescue Dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma glanced at Alexander as he drove. Though still somewhat doubtful, she nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her phone buzzed. Looking at the screen, she saw it was her husband calling. Her heart leaped with joy as she exclaimed, "It's your father! Could he have escaped?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma quickly answered and put the call on speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a</span><span> creepy</span><span> voice filled the car. "Trying to run? You really think you can escape? Listen </span><span>up! </span><span>I have Alvin. Be at Frenzy Bar at 8 PM. If you don't show up, Alvin will lose a leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't even think about calling the police unless you want to plan his funeral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sinister laughter echoed from the other end of the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Jordan!" Emma and Maxine were terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughter from the phone grew louder, more maniacal. "Emma, Maxine, I know you're listening. You two are quite the attractive pair, mother and daughter. That's why I won't kill you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Maxine, i</span><span>f you want your father to </span><span>be safe</span><span>, come to the bar tonight. Convince him to hand over the technical documents. Then you two ladies </span><span>sleep with me</span><span>, and I might </span><span>spare you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordan hung up with a sinister laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard!" Maxine exploded in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slight smile crossed Alexander's face. "I'll</span><span> send you two to</span><span> a safe place to stay. Tonight, I'll meet Jordan at the bar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, are you sure you can handle this alone?" Maxine asked worriedly. "Should we call the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "If the police could help, wouldn't you have called them</span><span> earlier</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine fell silent, her furrowed brow betraying her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Emma hesitantly spoke up, "Mr. Hawthorne... </span><span>W</span><span>hy are you helping us? Is it just because of my daughter?"</span></p></div>
