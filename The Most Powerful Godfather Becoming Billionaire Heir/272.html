        <h1>Chapter 272 A Golden Opportunity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The convoy came to a stop, and the car doors swung open. Schroder, clad in full military uniform and adorned with numerous medals, stepped out, exuding authority. A group of armed guards followed, their black boots clattering sharply against the marble floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's piercing gaze swept over the </span><span>crowd,</span><span> his head held high with an air of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, on behalf of the entire Hansen family, it's an honor to welcome you!" Orion hurried forward, his voice dripping with flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder nodded curtly and turned his attention to the car behind him. Orion's smile faltered, but he kept it in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door of the following car opened, and several members of the Fairfax family emerged, led by Jane, with Andrew and Belinda in tow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family was visibly excited; they had thought their fortunes were dwindling and never expected an invitation from Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, who had been distressed after her failed lawsuit against Alexander, found new hope in Schroder's invitation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, the head of the Fairfax family, was both shocked and overjoyed, barely containing his excitement at meeting the renowned Lieutenant General of the Northern Command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Andrew didn't know why Schroder had summoned them, he saw it as a golden opportunity for the Fairfax family. If it wasn't beneficial, Schroder wouldn't </span><span>have arranged for a private car to bring them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fairfax, a pleasure to meet you," Schroder said, eyeing Jane with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was impeccably dressed, her striking makeup complementing a black evening gown that highlighted her figure. Her graceful </span><span>walk in</span><span> sparkling heels exuded mature charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder hadn't expected Alexander's ex-wife to be so attractive, and he began to plot his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, General. I'm Jane," she replied, still unsure why this high-ranking official sought her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was thrilled. He had heard of this "playboy general" and assumed Schroder's interest in Jane was why they were invited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning towards Jane, Andrew whispered excitedly, "Sweetheart, the general's interested in you! This is a huge opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane hesitated but noticed the interest in Schroder's eyes. Despite recovering some money from Alexander, the Fairfax family was struggling and far from its former glory. Jane's resentment toward Alexander ran deep, fueled by his rise as a new elite in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for, honey? The general's interested!" Andrew nudged Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the chance before her, Jane fixed her gaze on Schroder, determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's eyes lingered on Jane, and he smiled, taking her hand. "Ms. Fairfax, you're stunning. I can't believe Alexander let you go. He must be blind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As eyes turned toward them, Jane felt no embarrassment. Instead, she was thrilled, meeting Schroder's gaze directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, General. With your stature, I'm surprised you'd notice someone like me," Jane replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder suddenly pulled Jane into a close embrace, grinning. "I have a soft spot for mature women like you, especially those who've been through a divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this, the crowd looked away, not daring to watch further. Orion was stunned, speechless at Schroder's unusual interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family was overjoyed, some even jumping with excitement. It seemed fortune had smiled upon them unexpectedly.</span></p></div>
