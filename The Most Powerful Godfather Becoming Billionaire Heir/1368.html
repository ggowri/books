        <h1>Chapter 1368 Not Allowed to Leave</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lana gasped, "Not much! Just a hundred thousand coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good girl, you've got guts! I told you to place a bet, not to go all in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we won, didn't we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lana mumbled, "Besides, with the way you were acting like you'd lose everything, how could I not bet big?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The great bronze bell of Dominion Church's bell tower echoed through the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was bound to be a sleepless night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the early hours before dawn, inside Courtyard 509 of the Dominion Church's Outer Court, Rhodes sat in the common hall, his face bruised and swollen. He remained silent, and the icy sword aura that usually surrounded him had completely vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew how long the silence lasted until Dexter, who had been standing by in a daze, suddenly erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhodes, you're a genius! You're already half a step into becoming a level-five warrior! Who does Alexander think he is? There's a tournament every year. Just wait until you reach level five! You'll crush him with a single finger. Then you can get your revenge, no problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' brow twitched, his expression shifting between shades of pale and dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment, he let out a deep breath. His face returned to its usual calm, as if even if the sky were falling, it wouldn't faze him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an overwhelming sword aura filled the hall, growing sharper and colder by the second. A thick layer of frost covered the room. Strangely enough, Dexter no longer felt affected by the cold. Instead, he felt warm, as if basking in a spring breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, Dexter exclaimed, "Rhodes! You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes suddenly burst into laughter. "Hahaha! At the next tournament, I'll crush him with just one finger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the study of the Marshal's Mansion in Darwin, Madden sat upright on an ornate gold-threaded mahogany chair, exuding an air of absolute authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held a jade cup, sipping slowly. His hands, as always, were pale as porcelain, spotless, and unblemished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kneeling on the floor, trembling, Julius knocked his head against the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, that Alexander was the bandit from last time! I spent ten thousand gold coins and Kean Manor to take Rhodes out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The jade cup shattered into pieces. Madden's eyes turned ice-cold as he spoke slowly, "Get out. You're not to leave the house for a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius scrambled to his feet and bolted from the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madden suddenly stood up, his face expressionless. Though it was the dead of winter, tiny arcs of electricity crackled in the air around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a storm was brewing, lightning flashing in silent fury. Even the books on the shelves seemed to sizzle and smolder...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grand halls of the Hrodvik Imperial Palace, lanterns illuminated the night. Quinton was hosting a family banquet with the Empress, consorts, princes, and his grandchildren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exchanged a glance with his elegant and poised wife. Together, they watched as Isolde animatedly recounted the tournament at Dominion Church, her gestures lively, her words flowing nonstop. A soft smile played on their lips...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Valdezs had made plans to meet up with everyone another day, choosing to first return home and reunite with their families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the small courtyard in Dominion Church where Alexander was staying, he sat cross-legged on his rosewood bed, meditating as he healed. He had just taken half a bottle of Mending Powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, he finally opened his eyes. Even though he had achieved the Golden Body, making his muscles and bones as tough as refined steel. It was far beyond that of an ordinary level-four warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes was still terrifyingly strong. He had already reached the peak of a level-four warrior and had grasped the essence of martial arts, putting him just a step away from becoming a level-five warrior. His strength was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's entire skeletal system had fractured. Cracks ran through his bones, his spine was shattered, and he had lost more than half his blood. By all logic, even if he survived, he should have been crippled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the mysterious warmth of his golden energy, along with the potent medicinal effects of Docpirin, had forcefully bound his bones back together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the damage to his meridians and skeleton was severe. His body was severely weakened. He wouldn't be able to train for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he could clearly feel his energy had grown stronger. Could it be that after achieving the Golden Body, he could survive near-death experiences just like a Saiyan, only to grow even more powerful in battle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan and the others noticed Alexander had opened his eyes. Seeing that he remained silent for a long time, Logan finally asked in a soft voice, "Alexander, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked up at Logan, Vegeta, and Nova, seeing the worry in their eyes. He smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing serious. I just won't be able to train for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan let out a sigh of relief and laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, Rhodes tried to be sneaky, but it backfired big time! He got so pissed, he ended up coughing up blood! Oh, and the Ministry of Revenue just sent over the coin notes and a property deed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he pulled out a stack of coin notes and a property deed from his coat and handed them to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander took them and examined them closely. The silver-coin notes amounted to 200,000 silver coins, while the gold-coin notes were ten in total, each worth 1,000 gold coins, adding up to exactly 10,000 gold coins.</span></p></div>
