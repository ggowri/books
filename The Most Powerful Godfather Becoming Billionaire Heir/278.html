        <h1>Chapter 278 Soaring</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman scrambled into a Volkswagen, desperate to escape.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Running won't help. Now that you're here, it's clear Johnny's just a front; you're the real mastermind," Alexander remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaped from the rooftop, descending like a force of nature. The onlookers were horrified; it was over 30 stories high, a drop of more than a hundred feet! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind howled past him, making Alexander feel like a meteor hurtling toward the ground. Without a way to slow down, even a Novice Warrior like him could be seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clutched his dagger tightly, plunging it into the concrete wall.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp screech and a shower of sparks erupted as the dagger carved a deep line in the wall. His descent slowed considerably, now at a speed manageable for him. He exhaled, releasing the breath he had been holding. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his Force, he pushed off the wall, gliding horizontally before landing smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his feet touched the ground, he rolled forward to absorb the impact, then quickly got up and sprinted after the car, which had just started moving. Everyone was stunned. He had jumped from such a height and was unharmed.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he even human?" they wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, faster!" Amanda was in a panic, her hands shaking as she tried to drive away. Alexander's leap had terrified her, and she couldn't imagine what would happen if he caught her. As he closed in, she felt as if needles were pricking her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the car roared to life, and Amanda floored the gas pedal, pushing the old Volkswagen to its limits. Even as the car moved, her face was a mask of terror.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why isn't it moving?" she screamed frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood in front of the car, grabbing the bumper and lifting the front end off the ground. The front wheels spun uselessly, but the car went nowhere. Amanda was terrified; this man was a monster.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turn off the engine and get out," Alexander ordered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amanda looked into his eyes, feeling dizzy, and instinctively followed his command. Once out of the car, she snapped back to reality.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... How did you do that? Do you have powers? Hypnosis?" she asked, horrified, her face twisted with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at her, noting her panic. "If I'm not mistaken, you're Schroder's lover, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amanda's face twisted in anger as she pulled out a gun and fired at him.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang, bang, bang!"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swiftly redirected her arm, causing the bullets to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amanda cried out, clutching her wrist in pain as the gun fell into Alexander's hand. He grabbed her like a rag doll, dragging her along.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm General Flores' woman. If you touch me, he'll come after you!" Amanda threatened defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Augusta and Marvin arrived, overhearing Amanda's threats. Without a word, Marvin slapped her twice, leaving her dazed and bleeding.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show some respect when talking to my boss, or you'll learn what fear really is," Marvin warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amanda spat blood, still defiant. "The General won't let you get away with this. Your families will suffer too..."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Marvin silenced her with a punch to the stomach.</span></p></div>
