        <h1>Chapter 565 Helping You With a Massage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a man was truly worthy of her trust. Nancy's initial hesitation and anxiety vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want it? If you do, I'll give it to you," she said with love and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander only kissed her a few more times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. You're not fully recovered yet. It might tear," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he grinned mischievously. "Can't you hold back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy blushed and looked away. "It's all your fault. Who told you to touch me? Now I can't hold back, and you're playing the good guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued to take advantage of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my room, after all. You came here willingly," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy covered her face, embarrassed. "I won't listen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In high spirits, Alexander channeled the Force into his palms and began massaging her ample curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Even if we can't go all the way, I can still give you a massage. It'll speed up your recovery and make you feel incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rough, warm hands moved over her peaks and valleys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander applied a generous amount of cream, giving her a full-body massage and spa treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, you're a devil. I want it even more now," Nancy muttered, writhing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this for breast enhancement? Damn it, I'm already too big. I don't want to enhance them, please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pleaded in vain, unable to escape Alexander's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only submit to his touch, moaning helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander licked his lips, feeling like he was about to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Nancy had only just experienced her first time the day before. He hadn't </span><span>expected her to fall for him so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Don't worry. The effects of the massage will only last for a while. If you don't use it regularly, it will revert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to see what you look like with E-cup breasts. You'd look so tempting in lingerie, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned as he continued the massage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched as her ample curves moved under his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so bad. I'll only let you do this once. No more breast enhancement. When I become an E-cup, you can touch and kiss as much as you want, okay?" Nancy panted, tempting Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't hold back any longer and pressed his manhood against Nancy's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy held onto it, kissing it passionately. She was no longer the inexperienced woman she once was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, women were not only innocent but also full of anticipation for such things. Once aroused, they became even more sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, most women couldn't guard their chastity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their first man was the one they remember most deeply, and their sensitivity was at its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if that man was smaller or less enduring, he could still bring them immense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as a woman experienced more men, her sensitivity decreased, making it harder to reach the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If subsequent men were smaller or less enduring, it would become even harder for her to feel pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was backed by scientific research data. A woman's threshold was determined by the number of men she had been with and their size and duration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander preferred pure women, partly due to his psychological cleanliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy had given him her first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander massaged every inch of Nancy's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy opened her mouth wide, clutching Alexander tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After intense trembling, she finally collapsed into Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feeling good?" Alexander asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy lay naked in Alexander's arms, panting shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel good, but you haven't yet. Let me help you," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She touched Alexander, serving him wholeheartedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned back against the bed, enjoying the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy knelt beside Alexander, burying her head and working diligently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her large breasts hung down, swaying with her movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her plump, round buttocks were fully exposed to Alexander's gaze.</span></p></div>
