        <h1>Chapter 1257 You Have to Live</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled violently as a massive fissure ripped open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crack snaked its way across the terrain, quickly advancing toward Fiona and Oswald, closing in on them with alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!" Fiona </span><span>screamed,</span><span> fear etched in her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald wasted no time, sprinting toward what he hoped was safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the fissure widened with a sudden surge, and in an instant, he felt as if a terrible monster had swallowed him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sliding helplessly into the abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!" Oswald's scream echoed as he desperately reached for a lamppost beside him, managing to stop himself from plummeting just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the pole wedged against the edge of the crack, the gap was stretching wider by the moment, threatening to pull him down into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook violently, the tremors growing ever stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lamppost couldn't hold on any longer. Oswald stared into the deep, inky void beneath him, despair creeping in&mdash;he knew that falling in meant certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at that moment, a rope flew through the air and landed right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the lamppost slipped into the fissure, he lunged forward and grabbed hold of the rope with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oswald! You've got to hold on! I'll pull you up!" Fiona shouted, wrapping the rope </span><span>around herself as she tugged back with every ounce of strength she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the ground continued to quake beneath them, and Fiona struggled to maintain her footing, finally dropping onto her stomach for stability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald dangled precariously, the immense force gradually dragging Fiona toward the widening crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Fiona wasn't about to let go; she dug in her heels, refusing to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Oswald was hanging in mid-air, swinging back and forth. The ground beneath him trembled more violently, as if it was trying to fling Fiona into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hang in there! Oswald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a precarious feat, she found a tiny foothold in the gap between two containers, allowing her to hold her ground for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the newfound leverage, she gripped the rope tightly, pulling with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald scrambled to climb upwards alongside her effort, but the coarse rope was cutting into Fiona's hands, pain shooting through her like fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Climb, Oswald! You need to get up!" Fiona urged, her voice a fierce declaration of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how excruciating it became, she refused to watch him fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Oswald's head emerged from the depths, and he glanced down to see Fiona bracing herself, keeping her feet wedged against the shipping container, </span><span>and </span><span>pulling with everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood seeped from her hands, and her face was pale with worry, a stark contrast to the fierce resolve in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she saw him reappear, tears slipped down Fiona's cheeks, and each droplet was a sign of relief mixed with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, another violent quake shook the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fissure yawned wider, and with renewed speed, it threatened to collapse entirely, even toppling nearby containers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's foothold evaporated beneath her; she felt her body slipping toward the gaping maw of the crack once more, a coldness settling in as numbness spread through her limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fissure crept ever closer, mere feet away from her. Inch by inch, it inched toward her, ready to swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald watched in horror, a bitter smile creeping onto his lips as he sensed the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that without Fiona, he would never make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But dragging her along meant they would both perish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona! You have to live!" Oswald shouted with all his strength, and in a heartbreaking moment of clarity, he voluntarily let go of the rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He plunged into the dark fissure and was swallowed whole, vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was still reeling from the shock when Oswald disappeared, having intentionally loosened the rope and dropped into the crack. In an instant, he was gone, swallowed by the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Fiona collapsed to her knees, a heart-wrenching scream tearing from her throat. "Oswald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a flood of memories surged through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pictures of their life together flashed before her eyes&mdash;one after another, each more vivid than the last. They had grown up together, worked side by side in </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port, and shared intimate moments in the container.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, you're so beautiful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, let's get married after we beat back those monsters, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, you have to give me three kids ..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald's words echoed in her ears, but he was nowhere to be found, swallowed by the fissure as if by a monstrous beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's eyes flooded with tears, and the expanding crack, the gunfire, the screams, and the howls of the mutated beasts seemed to fade into the background, as if the world had paused just for her.</span></p></div>
