        <h1>Chapter 1119 He Will Die Too</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was trapped in his seat, the poison coursing through his veins, making it impossible to break free from the wreckage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If anyone else had taken the punch he landed on Loren, they would have been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren didn't move at first, but his skin darkened rapidly, veins bulging grotesquely beneath his flesh, giving him a nightmarish appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shit...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is this old bastard becoming a living dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Loren let out a feral, animal-like scream, thrusting his dagger towards Alexander with vicious intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander spun around and landed another powerful blow, smashing Loren's head and splattering the inside of the car with a sickening black sludge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Loren's dagger plunged deeper into Alexander's side, the sharp blade biting through his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car was a bloody mess, with the lifeless bodies of Simeon and Loren sprawled on the floor. The carpet was soaked in blood, and the metallic stench of it filled the air, stinging Alexander's nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This had been one of the worst assassination attempts Alexander had ever faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dagger Loren wielded was coated in cyanide&mdash;one of the deadliest poisons known to man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cyanide was often called the "King of Poisons," and any spy worth their salt carried it, a deadly, almost instantaneous poison that could kill within seconds and was nearly impossible to counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had it not been for Alexander's extraordinary resilience and his "Force", he would have been dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Alexander could feel his body beginning to shut down as if it was going to crack open from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With sheer determination, he shoved the deformed car door open and stumbled out, dizzy and barely conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment his feet hit the ground, he collapsed onto his knees, his vision blurring. His trembling hand fumbled for his bloody phone, and with difficulty, he dialed emergency services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His back and chest were punctured by three deep wounds, the wounds already turning black as blood gushed out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just the poison&mdash;it was the triple-edged dagger that made the bleeding impossible to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood pooled on the ground, a dark, horrific bloom that seemed to spread with every passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with his body's resistance to toxins, the excessive blood loss would eventually claim his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The severity of his injuries sent him into a delirious haze, his mind briefly drifting back to several years ago, to the Fairfax family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered the blow to his head from a wine bottle, the pain, the blood&mdash;everything felt like the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the plague in Loscity, he hadn't seen Jane or Belinda. They had surely left the city. He didn't want to see Jane again&mdash;not ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So... am I really going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bitter smile tugged at the corner of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What about Ashley?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What about Ava?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What about the Ultimate Alliance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the blaring sirens of an approaching ambulance pierced through the fog of his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of survival instinct rushed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If only I'd brought Augusta, or even one of my subordinates... I wouldn't have ended up like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He cursed under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was careless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the ambulance pulled up beside him, a team of doctors in white coats rushed out, lifting a stretcher. Alexander let out a shaky breath of relief and finally closed his eyes, slipping into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Loscity Hospital Emergency Room. "How is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava, her eyes red from crying, rushed forward the moment the doctor stepped out, grabbing his arm desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh my!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctor stumbled back, startled by her sudden movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver quickly stepped in to smooth things over. "Ms. Blackburn, please, be careful. Dr. Cook is already in his sixties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava froze, taking a step back as she let go of Dr. Brody Cook, her hands trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ava wasn't the only one anxious&mdash;Betty, Rebecca, Melin, and the others were all on edge, their eyes glued to Dr. Cook as they waited for an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brody wiped his brow, feeling a chill run down his spine as all their eyes fixed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew the situation&mdash;two assassins had been killed by Alexander, but he had been gravely wounded and poisoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The poison? Cyanide&mdash;the most lethal poison known to man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Ava first heard the news, she nearly passed out from shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's my fault! It's my fault... I shouldn't have asked Mr. Hawthorne for help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver muttered to himself, slapping his own face in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of Alexander dying filled him with dread. If he did die, Ava, Brittany, and Grace would never forgive him. He could already imagine their fury, their wrath&mdash;he would never survive it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's voice was shaky as she asked, "Dr. Cook, how is Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brody's brow furrowed in confusion as he examined the charts, his tone cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This doesn't make sense. By all logic, someone poisoned with cyanide should be dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Mr. Hawthorne is still alive&mdash;though he's severely shocked from blood loss. We've given him a blood transfusion, and we're doing everything we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A moment of hope flickered in the room, and Melin's voice trembled with cautious optimism. "So, does that mean he's going to be okay?"</span></p></div>
