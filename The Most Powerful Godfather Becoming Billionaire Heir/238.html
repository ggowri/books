        <h1>Chapter 238 Loyalty</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sturdy and broad chest, along with his warm embrace, provided a sense of security she had never experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. It's my fault... You're the first man I've willingly been with, so I couldn't help it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but feel a heaviness in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could imagine what Alice had gone through in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter the circumstances, women were always more vulnerable, especially beautiful ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not your fault. I'm sorry. You can rest easy from now on. No one will bother you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice wiped her tears and opened up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out Alice had been orphaned at a young age and had been living on the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had no money and relied on welfare to survive. Some ill-intentioned men wanted to help me, but I knew what they were thinking. They were only interested in my maturing body. I'd rather starve than give in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's face was pale, and her voice trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how I survived back then? I begged on the streets, scavenged day and night, and even fought with dogs for food... I felt like a stray dog...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One night, I was targeted by a group of vagrants. If it weren't for the Godfather, I wouldn't be alive today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, I was raised by the Godfather. Those were the happiest days of my life. I lived like a wealthy young lady, with no worries about food or clothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice continued, "After I came of age, under the Godfather's arrangement, I gave my chastity to a powerful politician. After that, I served him for three years before being assigned to the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During those three years, I suffered many humiliations from that man, but I don't blame the Godfather. I'm still grateful to him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was too emotional to control her trembling, and she couldn't utter another complete sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at a loss for words. Alice seemed to be telling the story of a woman unrelated to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry for bringing up sad memories. Rest assured, no one will bully you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that Alice, who was so beautiful, sexy, and intelligent, would have such a tragic past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice clutched Alexander's hand and hugged herself tightly, trying to squeeze into his embrace as if to merge into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I've seen how you protect Ms. Blackburn, care for Betty, and even take care of Lara... So, I want to be your woman. That way, I won't be bullied!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She giggled triumphantly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only pat her back with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The past is best left behind. As long as you're loyal to me, there will be a bright future. I want your loyalty to me to surpass that to the Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice shivered involuntarily. She understood what Alexander meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her heart raced and she was filled with awe at the mere mention of the Godfather, she still nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, rest assured. I will be loyal to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, and they spoke no more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned against the headboard, with Alice lying in his arms, hugging him tightly. The atmosphere in the room was warm, devoid of any desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the exhausted Alice finally fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, on the other hand, looked down with a wry smile and shook his head helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his strength increased, it seemed that no woman could truly satisfy him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, John asked at the trading center, "How is Alexander? Anything suspicious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert replied quickly, "Mr. Butler, he's been normal and relaxed. Last night, he even had a call girl in his room. They're still in the room now. Our guys outside the door can hear the woman's voice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John couldn't help but laugh. "Young people, with their good stamina. We're all old now. Since he raises no suspicions, I'll personally submit his file to Mr. Bryant for review. This guy has potential and is worth cultivating."</span></p></div>
