        <h1>Chapter 231 Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obediently led the way in front, and the two of them walked towards the depths of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander released the Force to scan the surroundings, feeling extremely surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defense here was so terrifying that even the walls were filled with thick steel plates, and there was a fully automatic weapon system on standby 24 hours a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not surprisingly, these weapon systems were controlled by artificial intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, since you are a member of the Brilliant Group, you should understand that our treatment is very good. After becoming a supervisor, you will be promoted to a higher level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert kept talking about the benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him and looked around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Robert chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are indeed an extraordinary person. You have also discovered that the environment here is unusual, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are a team. I'll tell you the truth. Not only are there special steel plates inside the walls, but there are also special metal meshes that can block signals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Robert seemed quite proud. This demonstrated the strength of the trading center, which was second to none in the entire Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't expect that a trading center would cost so much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground fortress was more solid than one could imagine. Even if it were bombarded with cannons, it probably wouldn't have much effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, we arrive. Please wait a moment. I will go and report."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert politely led Alexander to the small reception room and then called in two young waitresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced around and saw that there was a surveillance camera right above the reception room. All his actions were under surveillance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was not worried at all and sat down on the sofa in a calm manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, would you like coffee or juice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitress asked delicately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all wore sexy low-cut miniskirts, with most of their plump breasts exposed, trembling, and very tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want a latte, then leave, I don't need you to accompany me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women immediately looked disappointed. After carefully serving the coffee, they slowly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander crossed his legs and sipped his coffee leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also many exquisitely shaped snacks on the coffee table, which were the work of an excellent chef and were delicious and fragrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was already hungry after walking around, so he started eating without hesitation...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in another luxuriously decorated room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert was serving a white-haired old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man tapped his fingers on the table while watching Alexander on the surveillance screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure he is one of ours?" The white-haired old man still couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert felt great pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said nervously, "Mr. Butler, you know I am always cautious. I have indeed checked his background and confirmed that he is Edison without a doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is very lucky. He unexpectedly has a rich father from the royal family, and his hypnotic ability is even better than mine. I didn't discover him before. Such a talent is really wasted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Robert's eyes flashed with undisguised fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Butler, I'm sure that he can hypnotize me if he wants to. So, I strongly suspect that he has special abilities in hypnosis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a long time, the white-haired old man didn't say anything and finally nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. Whether he is a hypnotist with ordinary abilities like you, or a psychic with special abilities, it is worth it for us to work with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your recommendation today was meritorious. I will report it to the chairman and reward you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert immediately smiled happily, thinking that he was lucky today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-haired old man changed the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever since Mr. Sebastian Tate's accident, the chairman has been practicing witchcraft in seclusion, hoping to have a big breakthrough. I don't know how he is doing now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was getting a little impatient waiting here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, footsteps were heard in the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the door was pushed open and the white-haired old man and Robert walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's wrinkled face had a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said kindly, "Mr. Hawthorne, my name is John Butler, and I am in charge of the trading center. Mr. Milton recommends you to be the security director of our trading </span><span>center. If you don't mind, how about fighting with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, John slapped Alexander on the chest.</span></p></div>
