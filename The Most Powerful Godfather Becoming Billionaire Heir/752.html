        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize pressed against Alexander with her buttocks and hips, continuously exerting force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander still smiled, savoring the wonderful feel of her buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much force Charlize exerted, Alexander felt nothing and stood there completely unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, unable to throw Alexander, suddenly felt both ashamed and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers among the team members were dumbfounded, not understanding why Charlize hadn't changed her tactics, since she couldn't throw Alexander and couldn't keep pressing against him like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a real fight, she would likely be countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Could it be that she's stunned because she can't throw him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was making wild guesses, all misunderstanding Charlize's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Put more effort into it, come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, you're deliberately bullying me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's forehead was beaded with fine sweat; she no longer had the mood for </span><span>flirtation, and she gripped Alexander's waist with both hands, exerting force continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander stood as if his feet were embedded in the ground, not moving an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize shouted and suddenly extended her leg behind Alexander, attempting to trip him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her movements were swift and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If an ordinary person were tripped like this, they would definitely be thrown hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the team members cheered for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As everyone watched Charlize insert her leg behind Alexander, no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't trip him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now everyone was shocked, and Charlize was at a loss, not knowing what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander grabbed Charlize's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands were like two iron clasps, holding her tightly so that she couldn't move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept smiling, clearly not using much strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, with anxiety, instinctively kicked towards Alexander's knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce move startled everyone, their faces showing expressions of worry and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew how formidable Charlize was; even a dozen people couldn't defeat her, and that was when Charlize was holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's kick was extremely vicious; if it hit their legs, it would either kill or cripple them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, with a light block and grab, easily caught Charlize's leg, rendering her immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Charlize's face flushed, and she tried hard to pull her legs back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could control her with just his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize cried out in surprise as Alexander directly pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Charlize's pretty face turned red, and her body felt numb and feverish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her butt pressed against Alexander's lower abdomen, and she could feel him becoming aroused. Immediately, she felt weak all over and collapsed in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, with a grin, whispered in her ear, "You have become more sensitive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize felt even more embarrassed, too shy to lift her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the team members were all stunned and stood there in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They admired Charlize in their hearts, but it was just a secret crush; at most, they would have an intimate encounter with her in their dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander now directly held Charlize in his arms, not at all like they were just exchanging techniques. They seemed to have sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's large, watery eyes gazed at Alexander, her look incredibly alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, what do you want to do in front of so many people?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed heartily and reached out to touch Charlize's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, look closely at the spot I'm pointing to. Why was I able to quickly subdue Ms. Collins? Now, I'll tell you: it's important to learn how to use skillful force, to overcome strength with weakness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Alexander continued to caress Charlize's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Collins' leg muscles are quite powerful, and the synergy between her muscle groups is extremely strong, at least several times that of an ordinary person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fingers moved as if playing a piano, pinpointing the key areas on Charlize's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "When the calf muscle group and the thigh muscle group work together, combined with strong tendons and bones, and the waist muscles also exert force, it can unleash the greatest power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, I preemptively cut off the muscle group coordination of Ms. Collins just now, so I was able to easily control her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand? Whether it's wrestling or combat, it's not always the strongest who wins, but rather the one who knows how to disrupt the opponent's muscle group coordination and seize the initiative!"</span></p></div>
