        <h1>Chapter 302 The Treatment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Melin unexpectedly reached out to Alexander, which was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander didn't go to the hospital. He just called Melin to give her his contact information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ava was still at home waiting for him, and she was the woman he treasured most in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, you're finally back! I'm so glad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander stepped through the door, Ava rushed into his arms, holding him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize stood </span><span>nearby,</span><span> her feelings quite complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't notice Charlize as he picked up Ava and headed toward the bedroom upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's beautiful eyes revealed a mix of envy and jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nestled in Alexander's embrace, her alluring figure pressed closely against him, her sparkling eyes captivating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlize is still here. Are you planning to misbehave?" she teased, pretending to be annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. Being with Ava brought a special feeling, excitement that he couldn't control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, he had been interacting with beautiful women, and with the influence of the Force left by James, he was in great spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Jane was captured by Schroder?" Ava asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, smiling wryly. "For Ashley's sake, I have to keep forgiving her. Now I need to put in the effort to rescue her. You're not angry, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava quickly shook her head. "Of course not! She is Ashley's mother after all, and Ashley misses her a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashley will be out of the hospital in a few days. I hope she can see her then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but feel moved, holding Ava even tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for taking care of Ashley during this time. She told me she really enjoys being with you. Don't worry, I'll rescue Jane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava smiled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good to hear! I really like Ashley and don't want her to be sad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander placed his hand on her breasts, lightly teasing. "Time for this month's treatment. You should lie down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's heart condition had improved significantly, but full recovery still required time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you just want to misbehave! Charlize is here!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed as she shook her head in refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't get treatment, your heart condition will relapse. I'm only helping you. Charlize won't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to refuse any longer, Ava finally decided to go along with it, gracefully removing her dress and revealing her white lace bra and a pair of white thong panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her enchanting figure was fully exposed, with big boobs and a nice ass, and Alexander felt a rush of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you going to help me with my treatment? Why are you just standing there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava pretended to be calm while enjoying the attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rubbed his hands together, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his eager expression, Ava couldn't help but giggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you'd help with my heart condition, but no funny business. Otherwise, I'll be mad at you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'm not that desperate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recalled the heated moments he had shared with Melin in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but compare Melin and Ava, both strikingly beautiful and curvy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ava, as the CEO of the Saint Group, naturally exuded an air of superiority, cold to other men but enchanting before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stark contrast made Ava all the more satisfying and captivating to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had already shared intimate moments, his heart raced with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander placed his hand on Ava's chest, he felt the warmth of her skin and the faint outline of veins beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a light touch ignited a fire within him, and he quickly focused his energy on suppressing his desires, beginning her treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers moved like a pianist playing a melody, starting slowly before picking up speed, rhythmically massaging her.</span></p></div>
