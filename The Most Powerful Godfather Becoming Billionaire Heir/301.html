        <h1>Chapter 301 Confession</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen's entire right leg&mdash;his toes, ankle, and knee&mdash;were all dislocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! I really don't know anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen's anguished screams echoed in the interrogation room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Oliver and several officers watching from the control room looked terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of ability does he have to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the interrogation room, Rosen lay on the floor, glaring at Alexander with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so vicious. The general will not let you go unpunished..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still not cooperating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed his left leg and shook it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen screamed again, all the joints in his limbs dislocated, pain rendering him immobile on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll ask you one last time&mdash;where is Schroder's hideout in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander loomed over </span><span>him,</span><span> his gaze icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen trembled but remained tight-lipped, clenching his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well, you are tough," Alexander said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then opened a black leather bag in front of Rosen, pulling out items one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp scalpel, a set of needles, pliers, a hammer... along with bandages, anesthetics, and various other medical supplies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled as he introduced the purposes of each item to Rosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most terrifying of all was the large glass jars he revealed last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One contained several black snakes, another was filled with army ants, and the last housed dozens of hornets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is torture! You're so cruel... I'd rather die than tell you anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha, I didn't say you'd die. You won't die. How about trying a hornet's sting? They love honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took out a small jar of honey, grinning as he said, "If we slather this on you, the hornets will be quite pleased..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen felt Alexander's gaze lingering near his crotch, nearly scaring him into submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll talk! I'll talk! Just don't do that to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Rosen's signed confession and a video of his admissions lay on Oliver's desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver slammed his hand down, knocking over his coffee cup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Schroder, a lieutenant general, actually ordered his subordinates to commit such a heinous kidnapping! This is outrageous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "He even impersonated the military to issue orders. General Thompson already knows about this and has promised to punish Schroder severely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? General Thompson knows?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver's face lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. When Schroder attended the Hansen family's gala, General Thompson was there too&mdash;though Schroder had no idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was cleverly leveraging Quentin's authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Quentin opposed Schroder's actions, he hadn't fully sided with Alexander, unless Alexander could save his ailing grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, visibly frustrated, asked, "What do we do now, Mr. Hawthorne? Should we surround Schroder and rescue Jane?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander answered calmly, "Director, there's no rush. Let me rescue Jane and the others first, then we can bring him to a military tribunal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, I need to consult with General Thompson. After all, Schroder is one of his key </span><span>officers, and we need his full support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we capture Schroder without his backing, it won't just be a slap in General Thompson's face, but also a disgrace to the Northern Command. Don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver nodded vigorously. "Yes, yes, you are right. Do you need my assistance in rescuing Jane?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. "No need to worry, Director. I'll have concrete news for you within three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! I'll follow your lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was best if Alexander handled it himself. That way, if anything went wrong, it wouldn't fall back on Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Oliver couldn't help but admire Alexander's exceptional skills and strategic mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Mr. Hawthorne, Melin asked me to tell you she's waiting for you to pick her up from the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver looked at Alexander with a mix of envy and subtle jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin had always been blunt with men. Countless distinguished suitors had pursued her, but none had succeeded.</span></p></div>
