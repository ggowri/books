        <h1>Chapter 440 Unbearable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murderous intent in Alexander's tone became stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowman finally couldn't bear it anymore and confessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it was Jane, your ex-wife. She asked me to do this. She said that if I could catch Lily, I could exchange your daughter and the magic potion formula with you, and then I could get 10 billion dollars from the Red Umbrella Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I said is true, I didn't lie... Please spare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked gloomy. He thought that it was the Red Umbrella Group that instigated Bowman, but he never expected that Jane was involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jane was not Ashley's mother and he had promised Frank to let her go, Alexander would go to the Fairfax Villa now and make this unrepentant woman pay the price she deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you the truth, I swear. Jane's the one who sent me here..."Bowman begged with tears in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve the punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped on Bowman's crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a shrill howl sounded. Bowman twitched violently several times and then fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice had already arrived with a large group of people; all of them were burly men in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand and said, "It's Jane who is behind this. Come with me and </span><span>destroy the Fairfax Villa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice's beautiful eyes widened in disbelief. She had never expected Jane to be so stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jane was anxiously waiting for news from Bowman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bastard, why didn't he answer the phone? Is there anything wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane held her cell phone tightly and paced back and forth in the room, feeling extremely anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda asked tremblingly, "Could Bowman be arrested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said angrily, "Mom, what nonsense are you talking about? I've already checked. Lily only has two bodyguards, but Bowman brought seven or eight people with him, which is more than enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Frank came out tremblingly, leaning on a cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, I heard everything you said just now. You are so stupid! How could you do such an inhumane thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank stamped his cane angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane snorted lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said disdainfully, "Grandpa, please stay out of my business. Alexander caused my dad to go to jail and forbade me to pick up Ashley. I must avenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank was coughing violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, look... your father brought this on himself. Following in his footsteps will only lead you down the same dark path. I don't want that for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, you are really old and confused. Why do you always speak for outsiders?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane turned away unhappily, ignoring Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda also glared at Frank fiercely as if she were looking at an enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be Bowman have captured Lily and made a deal with Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane cursed with gritted teeth; the more she thought about it, the more likely it seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the door of the Fairfax Villa flew up and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was startled and looked towards the door with wide eyes, only to see Alexander leading the way, with countless big men in black rushing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, what are you going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at her indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bowman has confessed everything. You have gone too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I go too far?" Jane screamed loudly. "Alexander, how could you say that I had gone too far? It was you who didn't allow me to pick up Ashley, and it was you who caused my dad to spend decades in jail. It's all your fault, but now you're blaming me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Frank pleaded with Alexander with the last glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm sorry. I kneel to you on behalf of the entire Fairfax family. Please forgive us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank knelt down in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Frank's grey hair and sickly face and sighed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was reluctant in his heart, he could no longer tolerate the Fairfax family causing trouble again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Send Sir Fairfax to a nursing home and take good care of him. Don't neglect him in the slightest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand, and several big men rushed forward and carried Frank away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank originally wanted to struggle and beg, but in the end, he sighed deeply and let them take him away.</span></p></div>
