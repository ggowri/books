        <h1>Chapter 1056 Back to the Obsidian Gang</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they came to their senses, Rosalia had already cut their necks with her dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four bodyguards had no resistance, clutching their necks and falling to the ground with widened eyes in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gore, who had been arrogant just now, was trampled by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go! Let me go. Bastard! I'm the senior leader of the Obsidian Gang. How dare you?" Gore was still yelling and struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Alexander didn't bother to reason with him. He stepped on Gore, and Gore screamed in pain and then fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Ariella and her two bodyguards come to their mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...are amazing!" Ariella was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's strength had been neck and neck with Ariella's. After what had just happened, Ariella thought she was no match for Rosalia at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella was sure that Alexander was much stranger than her. She couldn't even see his actions clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay here. I will take Ariella to the Obsidian Gang," Alexander looked at Ariella's subordinate and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The subordinate nodded and said, "Yes. Don't worry. I'll stay here and wait for your good news!" He was surprised. He had never thought that Ariella had such a strong backer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia kicked Gore. Gore screamed and woke up, horrified to see Alexander, not daring to yell again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gore, who colluded with Chase, was captured. The subordinate was full of confidence in Ariella's regaining control of the Obsidian Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we going to do in the Obsidian Gang?" Ariella was a little puzzled, wondering why Alexander wanted to go to the Obsidian Gang in such a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella thought, "Is it possible to get rid of Chase and recapture the Obsidian Gang just by the two of them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I will let you get the position of the head of the Obsidian Gang. Chase is no match for me at all." Alexander's tone was calm, revealing his absolute confidence. It seemed that seizing back the Obsidian Gang was as simple as breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella froze, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. Lead the way," Alexander said to Ariella and walked ahead. Rosalia dragged Gore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gore was shot in the stomach, but the internal organs weren't injured, and he won't die for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ariella took a deep breath and followed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headquarters of the Obsidian Gang was in an entertainment center, which was located in the most prosperous district of Aetheris Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People could drink, sing, eat, and date women in the entertainment center. It was decorated in an antique way, and there were a pair of mighty statues on the steps at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already late at night, but the entertainment center was brightly lit and packed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aroma of food and wine filled the air, and women's charming laughter could be heard on the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander, Rosalia, and Ariella walked on the steps, the surveillance camera immediately aimed at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People in the Obsidian Gang didn't know Alexander and Rosalia, but they knew Ariella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heir of the Obsidian Gang suddenly came back and surprised everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene of Rosalia carrying Gore, who was covered in blood, was quite noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people whispered, "How did Gore get caught by them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about others? Gore took a group of people out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lively entertainment center instantly quieted down, and a cold presence made many people nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people couldn't help but think, "Is Ariella coming back to avenge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were in a panic. After all, Gore was Chase's ally. However, Gore came back like this and looked dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Someone thundered, and immediately, dozens of people from the Obsidian Gang gathered around. Some of them had already taken out their daggers and guns, looking murderous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here, and I can spare you!" Alexander said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The invisible Force suddenly broke out and immediately enveloped those people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Screams sounded, and a group of people retreated as if they had been hit by a truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even some people's guns went off and hit their thighs. They fell to the ground and whined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people gasped and dared not approach Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the backyard, a middle-aged bald man ordered with a sullen face, "Let them in."</span></p></div>
