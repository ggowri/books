        <h1>Chapter 410 Coward</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A roar suddenly came from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Daniel was surprised, there was a loud bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thick door of the room flew off the frame and hit the wall so hard that it shook the entire room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel jumped in shock as he turned to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His henchmen were unexpectedly dumped in and left on the ground like trash, their eyes closed as they remained motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel cursed, and he never feared them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Ashley's hand and slowly walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees, even as the air seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel couldn't control his shivering. Alexander's eyes seemed like swords, and Daniel looked very panicked all of a sudden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole, what do you want? I'm the supervisor here, and this is my place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked Daniel in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel covered his stomach and fell to the ground as he shivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to resist, but he was so weak from the pain that it was hard for him to even move his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley pounced into Ava's arms and hugged her as tightly as she could with her little hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had tears in her eyes and hugged Ashley tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped right over to Daniel and looked at Ava tenderly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shook her head gratefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. Thank goodness you got here in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Ava looked at Daniel indignantly. Not only did he try to kidnap Ashley, but he tried to rape me. Damn that asshole!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll handle this. Take Ashley and wait for me outside. Be good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Ava on the shoulder, and his gaze on Daniel became extra fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava knew there were things later that Ashley shouldn't see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't ask anything and rushed towards the outside with Ashley in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ava got halfway there, she turned and looked worriedly at Alexander again, wanting to say something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and waved his hand. "Don't worry. This asshole won't do anything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ava and Ashley left, Alexander walked towards Daniel, who was lying on the ground, his eyes were so cold that it was as if he was looking at a dead man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Daniel no longer looked as arrogant and mighty as he did just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a dead silence, there was only Daniel's heavy and panicked gasping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was silent, but his expression became increasingly grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who were familiar with Alexander knew that he was truly furious and that cruel punishment would await Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to beat him up, there were suddenly noisy footsteps </span><span>outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, Jane and Simon appeared in the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could see Daniel sprawled out at Alexander's feet and several other large men falling to the ground in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon immediately looked enraged, not realizing that the result was the complete opposite of what he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Simon appear, Daniel was like seeing a savior, and they rushed to call for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simon, please save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it to do with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon knew something was wrong, and he hurriedly turned and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander blocked him quickly and mocked, "So you two are behind this. Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane immediately yelled, "Alexander. What did I screw up? Don't slander me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Alexander was no longer the man who allowed her to insult him at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Jane in disgust and casually waved his hand. Jane felt a huge invisible force crashing over her and fell to the ground as she cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you tell me the truth, maybe I can spare your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was so calm that it was like he was talking to a close friend he hadn't seen for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more he did so, the more Simon felt an unprecedented fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat kept coming out from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've misunderstood me, and I really have nothing to do with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was still shirking his responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel glared at him grudgingly, not realizing that Simon, with his powerful background, was acting like a coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, why were you doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coldly continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he hadn't done anything yet, his invisible rage continued to intensify, crushing them as if they were mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel broke out in a cold sweat and completely slumped to the ground like a confessing toad.</span></p></div>
