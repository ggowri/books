        <h1>Chapter 1046 A Sudden Chaos</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith had barely taken a few steps when Lionel </span><span>shot him</span><span> again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Keith stumbled just enough for the bullet to miss his heart and instead hit his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, he was drenched in blood, collapsing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Keith had reached a busy street, and chaos erupted around him as people on the street saw his miserable state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's been killed! Someone's hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? Was it a car accident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd gathered, some people fleeing in panic when they saw what happened, and someone calling the police. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd had jammed the traffic, and the blaring car horns made the scene even more chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, several black Mercedes sped towards Keith and screeched to a halt by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen Dragon Gang members jumped out of the cars and surrounded Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all pointed guns at Lionel and his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fuck</span><span>! It's Dragon Gang!" one of Lionel's men muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! I've already shot him twice. There's no way he's surviving. Dragon Gang has too many </span><span>thugs</span><span>. Let's get out of here," Lionel said without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want to risk a street battle with Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Help him! Ms. Walsh said he couldn't die!" shouted a Dragon Gang member</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> </span><span>A </span><span>group of his men chased after Lionel while another </span><span>group </span><span>pushed bystanders aside and rushed to lift Keith into a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him to the hospital! If he dies, we're all in trouble</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move it! Stop dawdling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Keith was placed in the car, several vehicles honked their horns and sped off toward the hospital, crashing into several roadside stalls and causing people to scream in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! </span><span>Are they crazy</span><span>? They</span><span>'re</span><span> so </span><span>fierce</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hey, shut up</span><span>. Look at the license plates! They're Dragon Gang! You'd better stop talking about them like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to speak after hearing that. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since the Sakra Society had been targeted, Dragon Gang's power had surged, making it the dominant force in Risun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had grown so strong that even the Sakra Society had to give way in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith had been whisked away, leaving only a pool of blood behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, police sirens were heard in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People, fearing trouble, quickly dispersed, and the area was soon empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Loscity, Alexander had already brought Rosalia along for the trip to Lumiria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an emergency. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't catch Cyclops soon, Cyclops</span><span> </span><span>might flee with Hazel again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Augusta and Charlize keeping his families safe, Alexander wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for bringing Rosalia wasn't because he was </span><span>obsessed</span><span> with her body</span><span>. There is another reason. A</span><span>fter some time spent in meditation, Rosalia had reached a bottleneck in her abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander believed that for Rosalia to break through this bottleneck, she must enter combat, seeking progress in life-and-death situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He anticipated that their journey to Lumiria would be</span><span> hard</span><span>, which was why he decided to bring her along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty had wanted to assemble an elite team to accompany Alexander, but he had refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aetheris Street in Lumiria is a complex place, with many factions involved..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the plane, Alexander pondered how to capture Cyclops quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he knew Cyclops was in Aetheris Street, he wasn't sure of his exact location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I have a contact in Lumiria. She's the daughter of the Obsidian Gang's leader, named Ariella Clarkson. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The Obsidian Gang is the local power in Lumiria, and I can ask her for help," Rosalia said, leaning into Alexander's </span><span>arms</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, giving her a once-over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was wearing a white T-shirt, her flat stomach exposed, the tight fabric accentuating her </span><span>big boobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her deep, enticing cleavage seemed to draw the attention of every man nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shorts were a pale blue, so short</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>hey barely covered the tops of her thighs, revealing long, smooth legs. Her toenails were painted </span><span>with </span><span>scarlet</span><span> nail polish</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, we haven't even taken off yet. No need to rush," Alexander teased, gently reassuring Rosalia, his hand resting on her smooth thigh, caressing it slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby men couldn't help but stare in envy, their eyes wide with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't care. He enjoyed the attention, a sense of satisfaction filling him.</span></p></div>
