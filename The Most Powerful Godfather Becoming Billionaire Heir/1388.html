        <h1>Chapter 1388 Finally Tamed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few people rushed forward to help him up. The purple-robed disciple was pale, his clothes torn, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. He trembled, unable to say a word. The others exchanged glances, then silently turned and left the stone chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched them go, deep in thought. Tigris was at least a level-four warrior. If he could tame the beast, it would be a huge asset. But could he really pull it off...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, he clenched his fists. A surge of protective energy erupted around him as he tapped his toes against the ground. Bang! Bang! Bang! His figure shot forward like a streak of lightning, ghostly yet swift, gliding toward the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he entered the cave, a fierce and violent gust of wind rushed toward him. Alarmed, Alexander reacted instantly, his body flashing several yards away like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused his gaze. A massive tiger, nearly half his height, stood before him. A bold character was etched on its forehead, its body covered in black-and-white stripes. Its tail lashed like a whip, and its glowing red eyes burned with a chilling ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tigris pressed its paws into the ground, releasing arcs of white lightning. A deafening wind roared as the beast lunged like an arrow straight for Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed with icy determination. "Hah!" he exhaled sharply. His arms shot up like iron pillars, protective energy surging, blocking both of Tigris's claws midair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of mischief flickered in Tigris's eyes. Its massive jaws snapped open, spitting out a blinding, bowl-sized ball of lightning straight at Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's pupils shrank. Letting out a sharp cry, he twisted his body into a snake-like motion. In a split second, he sidestepped the attack, his elbow shooting forward like a spear, aiming straight for Tigris's skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tigris let out a deafening roar, like a thunderclap in a clear sky. The force of the sound sent Alexander's head spinning, momentarily dazing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp crack of a whip rang out. A blurred shadow streaked toward Alexander's head at an unimaginable speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danger! Alexander roared, his muscles swelling. A storm of wind and thunder erupted around him. Waves of protective energy surged from his palms like a raging tide, crashing toward Tigris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom! Tigris was sent flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finish it while it's down! Alexander rooted his feet, his body twisting. His hands formed an energy sphere at his waist, crackling with dazzling lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless orbs of blinding silver-white energy coalesced in his hands, forming a radiant sphere out of thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Energy Plot Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful thrust, Alexander launched the energy sphere. It transformed into a massive silver-white beam, cascading down like the Milky Way, striking the airborne Tigris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! The impact erupted in a brilliant explosion, sending blood spraying in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cave trembled, cracks spreading across the walls as debris tumbled down. Tigris lay embedded in the stone, its limbs limp&mdash;it appeared unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where Tigris had collapsed, a hidden alcove was revealed, glowing with a faint, multicolored holy light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly pulled out his silver token from his spatial pouch and placed it inside the alcove along with a hundred thousand coins. Instantly, a silver-threaded pouch and a small booklet appeared inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver waist token radiated a soft, multicolored holy glow, enveloping both Alexander and Tigris. A soothing warmth spread through his body, and an inexplicable bond formed between them. Slowly, Tigris stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tigris awoke, its eyes were filled with devotion. It wagged its tail, circling Alexander before gently biting his pant leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed happily and couldn't resist crouching down to hug Tigris. Its fur was warm and incredibly soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! Stop licking me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, Alexander emerged at the cave entrance, holding the silver-threaded pouch and the Book of Spirit Beast in one hand while wiping tiger drool off his face with the other, looking helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, my coins and martial virtue points are gone... Guess I'll skip the Treasure House and check out the trading fair instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, Logan, Vegeta, Nova, Josh, Ivan, and Ryker were all gathered in the Main Hall of the Kean Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta reported in a serious tone, "Mr. Hawthorne, that Klein Hemsworth couldn't withstand the torture and has died. We managed to extract the Levitating Technique from him. Though it's incomplete, it's still usable. I take full responsibility for my failure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was thrilled. "As long as we got the technique, that Risunese bastard's life wasn't worth a damn. Gotta admit, though, he was tough&mdash;survived almost all of the Ten Tortures. Make four copies. One for me, one for Julius, and the other three for you, Nova, and Josh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Vegeta replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that he had learned the Levitating Technique, Vegeta's strength would soar even further. Ever since he had awakened his one-star Saiyan physique, he had reached the level-four warrior stage, progressing at lightning speed. He wondered&mdash;what realm had Alexander reached? And when would he have the chance to test his strength against him...</span></p></div>
