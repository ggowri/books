        <h1>Chapter 1330 Analysis Paralysis</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this modern age, people only studied the truth to gain something from it, treating religious devotion like a business transaction. No wonder the divine teachings said that wordless scriptures could be just as valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After mulling it over for a while, Alexander couldn't help but crack a smile. He would never really understand the cost of things until he had to manage them himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a lay disciple now. The Dominion Church had never charged him a penny&mdash;they even provided free room and board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with over a million members, the Dominion Church's annual expenses for food and maintenance alone must be astronomical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when he was growing melons at Emerald Manor, they'd treated the workers like kings. The food was top-notch, medical care at the church was free, and they even got double wages each month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regular folks who came to worship could grab a meal at the dining hall too. All they had to do was give the kitchen staff a heads-up. There was no charge, but they couldn't waste food. It was as simple as that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there were the Teleportation Plates&mdash;those things required high-grade emerald stones to hold sacred energy. The stones would crumble to dust after a while of use, burning through coins like nobody's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, whenever natural disasters hit&mdash;droughts, floods, earthquakes&mdash;the church would pour massive resources into relief efforts, opening their granaries to feed the people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all these expenses piling up, the church couldn't afford to run low on coins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a wave of relief wash over him. Thank God Timothy had been such a sucker, dropping those thousands of coins into his lap. Otherwise, he'd be in deep trouble now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did a quick mental inventory of his assets&mdash;two thousand-coin notes from the Hrodvik Treasury, plus another two hundred coins from selling that Melon King hide. The rest&mdash;a few hundred in loose change&mdash;was stashed away with Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Alexander decided to spend 2,000 coins to get four hours of study time&mdash;two hours each on the second and third floors. The fourth and fifth floors were way out of his budget for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tossed a thousand-coin note into the donation box by the entrance and headed straight for the bookshelves. Weirdly enough, the usual force field didn't stop him&mdash;he actually made it to the shelves without any hassle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The library pass included a detailed catalog of each floor's collection. Alexander started flipping through it, taking mental notes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second floor was packed with basic combat techniques. Most of them were from the Dominion Church, with a sprinkling of other churches' methods mixed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had everything he could think of&mdash;punching techniques, palm strikes, movement skills, sword forms, blade mastery&mdash;basically a complete martial arts buffet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No point in checking out the defensive stuff yet," Alexander thought to himself. He figured it'd be a while before he hit level-three warrior, plus his Force had already jacked up thanks to his golden energy. His physical strength was already on par with your average level-three warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered how he'd gotten his butt kicked during the Thunderclap Bronze Men trial because he didn't have any movement techniques. If he'd known some fancy footwork, he wouldn't have had to tank those hits. "Definitely need to grab a movement skill book," he decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also knew he needed to pick up at least one weapon technique. Going barehanded forever wasn't exactly a solid game plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had to admit. If he ever made it to level-five warrior, weapons would be kind of pointless. At that level, the Diamond Body basically turned him into a human weapon anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't know the first thing about movement techniques, but since all these skills were basic-tier, none of them could be that amazing anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spirit Step Evolution&mdash;perfect!" He thought. The name alone got him hyped. "A technique that made you move like a spirit? Hell yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After picking his skill, he started scanning through the books by their reference numbers. At 1,000 coins for two hours, every minute counted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his time was running out, Alexander returned the Spirit Step Evolution to the shelf and ran through the technique in his head one last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man, Spiritual Awakening is such a game-changer," he thought with a grin. "Perfect memory is no joke. If I'd had this in high school, I could've cruised into the Ivy League without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving up to the third floor of the Manual House, Alexander pulled out his library pass and started browsing the combat arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lunar Whip looks sick... And that Demon Slayer Blade isn't bad either..." He was stuck in that classic can't-decide moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his chest warmed ever so slightly where his golden energy rested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he felt an inexplicable pull toward staff techniques. "Staff arts, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dragonhell Staff?" he thought. "That's an awsome name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly tossed a thousand-coin note into the offering box and made a beeline for the Dragonhell Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Alexander walked out feeling totally played. "I wanted the Demon Slayer Blade technique! How'd I end up learning staff combat instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head, he pulled out his library pass and eyed the fourth floor's signature techniques, practically drooling at the possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifth floor can wait. Not like I'm an inner disciple yet anyway," he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something caught his eye. "Wait, where's the famous Muscle-Tendon Classic? Don't tell me it's not that great?" Alexander wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last page of his library pass held the answer: [Missing Techniques: Muscle-Tendon Classic, Heart of Enlightenment Method, Dragon Combat... Martial virtue points were awarded for any manuscript donated to the Manual House.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sweet." He grinned. "That Timothy guy must've been quite the mini-boss to have such a nice collection."</span></p></div>
