        <h1>Chapter 652 Ready</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley understood that Alyssa wanted him to follow Alexander and monitor his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please take a break here. I'll make you some coffee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Stanley was not optimistic about Alexander, he was still very polite to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly and didn't say much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, people in the conference room were arguing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people questioned Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Perry, do you think Alexander was telling the truth? I don't think so. We should let Stanley act quickly and follow the previous plan to bribe the people with some benefits. The situation is very urgent now and we can't delay any longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa gave him a cold look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand that you don't know Mr. Hawthorne well, but you can't question my judgment. With Mr. Hawthorne's ability, he is not talking nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's wait patiently. There are always some </span><span>genius</span><span> in this world that we have never met!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Alyssa no longer paid attention to the opinions of others but gave orders to double the guards around the entire building and the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All surveillance systems were turned on, and they even brought in a few specially trained Rottweilers to patrol and keep watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dragnet had been formed around the conference room. With such strict defense, it was impossible to sneak in without being noticed, even for a bird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arranging everything, Alyssa felt a little uneasy, wondering if it was too strict for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking that the Mafia's guard was no weaker than her arrangements, Alyssa felt a little bit of anticipation again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he made it, Alyssa would follow Alexander's arrangements in everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was the Axe or herself, she could dedicate everything to Alexander just to unify Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Alexander's handsome appearance, Alyssa felt excited. It seemed like she hadn't been with a man for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After only a short moment of excitement, Alyssa calmed down. These would happen only after Alexander successfully sneaked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen leaders of the Axe remained silent, clearly lacking confidence in Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought Alexander was bragging, but due to Alyssa's prestige, they didn't dare to say anything more. They all thought that Alyssa had been deceived by Alexander and they were wasting time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was arranged, Alyssa informed Stanley that it was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley answered and hung up the phone, then smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Mr. Hawthorne, Ms. Perrys said that everything has been arranged. The guards have been doubled, all monitoring systems are fully turned on, and there are several Rottweilers. Please be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, see you in the conference room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly, activated his All-seeing Eyes, stared straight into Stanley's eyes, and his tone of voice became relaxed and tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't had a good sleep for a long time. Go to sleep and have a good dream. Everything will be fine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley suddenly became dazed. Under the control of All-seeing Eyes and the Force, he soon felt dizzy. The scene in front of him became blurred, and he felt groggy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have a good sleep peacefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words were like pressing a button to make Stanley sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's eyes went dark, and he fell asleep on the sofa, snoring loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's current strength, he could easily hypnotize and control even a master like Stanley, who had good skills and strong willpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Stanley, who was sleeping, and smiled, then left the lounge </span><span>silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have turned into a faint shadow, moving through dark corners, using various covers to silently approach his destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard at the staircase door felt something was wrong and quickly raised his gun to search around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the guard could even scream, Alexander slapped him on the neck, and he fainted immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surveillance camera was constantly turning, scanning the surrounding situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander could always find a gap to sneak in from the impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Alexander's speed was too fast, and he disappeared in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his extraordinary skills and mysterious abilities, he silently returned to the floor where the conference room was located.</span></p></div>
