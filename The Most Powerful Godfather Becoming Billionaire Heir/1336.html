        <h1>Chapter 1336 Ambushed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold laugh, seeing right through their game. It was classic intimidation tactics&mdash;first they'd try to break his spirit, then they'd sweet-talk him. If they succeeded, he'd be lucky to fight at even seventy percent of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So they're still scared of me... Maybe I can use that," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He plastered a terrified expression on his face and cried out, "Please, spare me! I never meant to go against Mr. Wetherall. It was all Sellers! He put me up to it! I have critical information for Mr. Wetherall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swordsman in his forties couldn't hide his contempt. "What a joke, and here I thought we'd have a real fight," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn spoke carefully, "Sellers? What information?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, just tie me up and take me to Mr. Wetherall. I'll beg for forgiveness and share this huge secret with him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Alexander inched forward, subtly closing the distance between himself and the swordsman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn barked at Kenny, "Bind him tight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenny's face lit up with excitement. Julius had promised a fat reward, dead or alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinning, he pulled out the cord and strode toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kenny got close, ready to bind him, Alexander suddenly looked up with a smile that stopped everyone in their tracks. Who would smile like that when they were about to die? Was this guy completely crazy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alexander's expression shifted to one of pure malice as he growled, "You all know the High Master, Hezekiah Ramsey, from the Dominion Church, right? The one who helped me achieve my Spiritual Awakening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze in shock. In that moment of stunned silence, Alexander's desperate shout cut through the air. "Mr. Ramsey, help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's hearts nearly stopped. Hezekiah was rumored to possess supernatural abilities that could make even the most powerful people feel like insignificant bugs. Their eyes darted around nervously, searching for any sign of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sprang into action. He dismounted in one fluid motion, channeling the Force through his core. His left hand shot out like an eagle's talon, grabbing Kenny's arm and throwing him off balance with a twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Alexander's right elbow became a spear, driving straight into Kenny's chest. The strike was lightning-fast and devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenny didn't even have time to grunt before he went flying toward Finn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror had frozen Kenny in place just moments before. He'd heard the air crack around him, felt the impact in his chest, and then everything went black as he was launched through the air...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a fierce battle cry as he channeled another surge of the Force, directing it down through his feet in a spiral pattern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three rapid footsteps rang out like gunshots as Alexander launched himself through the air toward the swordsman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged swordsman's mind was reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First the revelation about Hezekiah's connection, then Kenny getting thrown through the air&mdash;he could barely process what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could get his bearings, he heard that battle cry and saw a blur of movement coming at him like a ghost. On pure instinct, he twirled his steel sword in a defensive pattern, thrusting it forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword thrust straight for his head, but Alexander let out a cold scoff. He twisted his body in an impossible angle, letting the blade whisper past him without leaving a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy surged through his body in a spiral. With a series of lightning-fast movements, he deflected and redirected the swordsman's force, using the man's own momentum to break his guard wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opening, Alexander moved like a coiled spring. He spun into close range, bringing his hands together in a brutal strike that slammed right into the swordsman's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sickening crunch as the man's throat and neck shattered. The sword clattered to the ground as its owner crumpled like a ragdoll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Alexander pivoted on his toes. With an explosive burst of power, he launched himself straight at the hulking Baylor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little punk!" Finn roared in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smashed Kenny aside with a devastating blow, and a faint glow began to shimmer around his body. With a fierce battlecry, he shot toward Alexander like an arrow released from a bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had just taken down two opponents in the blink of an eye. Baylor had finally shaken off his shock, only to see death rocketing toward him. Pure terror gripped his heart. "Iron Defense!" he screamed desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baylor's muscles bulged like coiled pythons as he swung his massive fists&mdash;each one the size of a dinner plate&mdash;at Alexander's head in a devastating combo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found himself caught in a deadly trap. Baylor blocked his path forward, while Finn, a level-three warrior, was closing in from behind. He was stuck between a rock and a hard place. If Baylor managed to slow him down even for a second, Finn would catch up, and then he'd be seriously screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Baylor's iron-like fists came crashing down, Alexander let out a piercing battle cry. He tried a desperate move&mdash;reversing his Force spiral in his martial core. But the maneuver backfired spectacularly. His body, which had been in rapid motion, suddenly froze mid-stride as if hit by an invisible wall. Blood sprayed from his mouth as the reversed Force tore through his internal channels. He'd just played himself with his own power.</span></p></div>
