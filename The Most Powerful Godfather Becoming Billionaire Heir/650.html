        <h1>Chapter 650 Crazy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those top leaders all stared at Alyssa in disbelief, wondering whether their boss really believed that arrogant brat who was obviously bragging about himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't believe him, but the surprise and joy in Alyssa's eyes made them feel like she was a strange woman rather than their boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alyssa admired this mysterious young man and found his unfathomable eyes particularly enchanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when Alexander offered to help, she really wanted to know what he would do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered for a while and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The plan you just came up with, to bribe them with your profits, may work in the short term, but it is not feasible in the long term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, the promoter of the alliance is the Mafia, and sacrificing half of your </span><span>interests manifests your fear and nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, they are strong enough to crush the Axe, which means they won't give up their league but will only consolidate their alliance to wipe out the Axe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharing his analysis eloquently, he swept everyone with sharp eyes, and no one dared to look him in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason Paxton didn't start war was because of the lack of permission from his boss. But now, he has gained support; that's why the Weaver family, Southern Mining and the Glory Association agreed to ally with him. Therefore, if you want to use part of the benefits to break the alliance, I'm afraid you can't make it!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa and the other leaders were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made sense, and they also considered what he said. But at this critical moment, giving up their benefits was the best solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one wanted to fail or to lose everything they strove to attain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, everyone in the Axe, including Alyssa, had already anticipated their tragic end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how indistinct the success could be, when Stanley proposed to compromise and break up the alliance, even if they knew it would not succeed, they still had to give it a try because there was no better way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Alexander had directly pointed it out, the fire of hope in everyone's heart was also extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked grim. Some clenched their fists tightly, while others couldn't control the twitching of their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only one who remained calm was Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Mr. Hawthorne is right. I assume we have to retreat and come back when the chance of counterattack is ripe." Alyssa made a very rational choice. As long as she saved their lives, they would have a chance to rise again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was full of determination, and she said coldly, "Even if they force us to leave, we won't let them have what they want so easily. Before we leave, blow up all the gem mines and warehouses. Let them do their business in the ruins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone echoed with sorrow and resolution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Stanley stood up and angrily questioned Alexander, "Didn't you say there was another way? Why don't you just be straightforward and tell us what to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile appeared on Alexander's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not the time to give up everything. I said, they come for me, and I will destroy their alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me all the information about Paxton, the Weaver family, Southern Mining, and the Glory Association, especially the location of their headquarters, maps, and detailed photos of their bosses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I kill all the leaders of these gangs, those gangs will naturally fall into internal strife without you having to do anything. By then, they will be busy fighting among themselves; how can they unite to deal with your gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leisurely illustrated his plan, which shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can even take advantage of their internal fighting to attack them, annex them, and occupy the entire town. How about that?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's deep and sharp eyes swept across everyone as if they could give people unlimited confidence and courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was dead silence at first. Everyone stared at Alexander as if he were an idiot. Then, the crowd was in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it even possible to kill all their bosses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa looked at Alexander in shock and was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander could manage to achieve his proposal, all her enemies would be in chaos. Not only could the Axe's crisis be solved, but they could also swallow up their enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this assassination plan was way too crazy and impractical!</span></p></div>
