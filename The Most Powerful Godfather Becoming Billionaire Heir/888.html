        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame roared furiously, unleashing his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow felt a massive force hit his hand instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame swung his katana down again with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade flashed past as Shadow barely dodged it, but a chunk of flesh was scraped off his right hand holding the dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His quick reflexes saved him; otherwise, he would have lost his hand entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow quickly retreated, avoiding Flame's next three strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against such a master swordsman, Shadow struggled to defend himself with just a small dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame! How are you still alive? You belong in hell!" Shadow shouted, his eyes blazing with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both he and Flame came from the same secretive family of assassins. They had different legacies but became equally elusive killers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, Flame betrayed the family for money, drawing powerful enemies who wiped out the clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow was the sole survivor, and from then on, they became bitter enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame joined the Mafia and became their top-ranked hitman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow, meanwhile, became Alexander's father's personal bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two glared at each other, both slipping into assassination mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension was suffocating. A single mistake could mean being torn apart the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh... Shadow, you're the last one who slipped through the cracks. I won't let you go. I'll kill you for sure!" Flame said, his grin turning wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame's expression grew increasingly manic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stuck out his tongue, licking the blood off his katana, and howled madly, "I love the taste of blood&mdash;it's delicious... Soon, I'll carve out your heart, slice it up for sashimi, and savor it slowly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Flame lose himself further, a woman in the shadows of the trees frowned and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Welsh, Flame's losing it again... If he keeps going, killing and eating people, he might slaughter everyone around him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke observed calmly, a contemptuous smirk on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him lose it. A lunatic is still just a lunatic. They may not fear death, but they aren't as clever as sane people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marvin's palms were drenched with sweat as he muttered to himself, "Boss, when are you coming in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he and Shadow were at a disadvantage. If it came to an all-out fight, they might not stand a chance against these three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame roared wildly, spinning his dual katanas into a terrifying wheel of blades as he charged at Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of retreating, Shadow lunged forward, firing his submachine gun at Flame </span><span>until the clip was empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame moved like a nimble viper, evading every bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow hurled the empty gun at Flame. With a flurry of metallic clangs, Flame sliced it into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two collided violently, and Shadow's figure disappeared into the storm of spinning blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered everywhere, accompanied by cries of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They attacked each other relentlessly, their movements so fast that the darkness seemed to hold a dozen figures battling at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Flame's katanas snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurled the broken blade at Shadow and, gripping his remaining katana with both hands, lunged at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's disadvantage lay in his single dagger. After deflecting the broken blade, he couldn't evade in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame's katana stabbed into his shoulder, the tip piercing through to his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact pinned Shadow to a tree, excruciating pain radiating from his shoulder through his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson blood gushed out like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow screamed in agony, feeling as though the blade had torn his body apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" My blade is poisoned&mdash;you're as good as dead!" Flame taunted gleefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame had the upper hand and reveled in his dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the last one who slipped away, and today, you're finally in my grasp," he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow suddenly lunged forward, plunging his dagger into Flame's abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid Flame's scream, Shadow retreated into the forest shadows, still impaled by the katana in his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You're not getting away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from Flame's stomach, but the dagger hadn't gone deep. His injuries were far less severe than Shadow's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flame picked up the broken blade from the ground and quickly gave chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two disappeared into the darkness, one after the other, as Flame's furious roars echoed through the forest.</span></p></div>
