        <h1>Chapter 1027 A Turn of the Tide</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild's subordinates wore expressions that were darker than sorrow itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they stood in despair, a proud and confident voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla stepped forward and stood before Fairchild. Her eyes gleamed with a strange light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cloud of black smoke engulfed Fairchild's body. The dark mist seemed alive, swirling into his ears and nostrils, seeping into him from every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike the others who had been poisoned and suffered horrific and disfiguring decay, Fairchild didn't rot away. Instead, his heartbeat returned, growing stronger by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's happening here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild's subordinates, half in shock and half in joy, exclaimed, "Mr. Torres is alive! He's not dead! He's still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlize furrowed her brows and whispered, "What does this woman think she's doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava, however, seemed to have a sudden realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She muttered under her breath, "She's at a disadvantage right now; of course, she's trying to win them over. If her medical skills are as good as she claims, there will definitely be people who'll help her. Some will even stop targeting her, thinking of the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd fell into a stunned silence, and disbelief was painted on everyone's faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild's eyes slowly opened, his gaze locking onto Skyla in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you... Did you save me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla gave him a look that was neither a smile nor a sneer. Her eyes were full of disdain. It was the look of a queen contemptuously eyeing her subjects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can save you. But if you don't follow my orders, I won't fully heal you," she said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild didn't hesitate for even a moment. He immediately agreed his voice firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine! If you can save me, I'll do whatever you ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised his hand. "From now on, we all listen to Ms. Vanderbilt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Torres!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than a hundred members of Savage Tiger Clan echoed in unison, rallying behind Skyla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, the Vanderbilt family's morale soared. Ava and the others frowned. This wasn't a good sign. The balance of power had shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Vanderbilt, please save my life. I'm sick, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another gang leader, Derek Miller, stepped forward, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Derek was from Tikoferi and had been hoping to get Alexander's help with his illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Alexander had no sympathy for this gangster suffering from late-stage syphilis, so he refused to help him in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Derek was a powerful figure in Tikoferi, controlling hundreds of street prostitutes. As a top boss, he had a new woman every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of those women, seeking revenge, had deliberately hidden the fact that she was infected and passed syphilis on to Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Derek realized, it was already too late. His syphilis had advanced to the third stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Doctors told him that unless something were done soon, not only would he lose his manhood, but his life would be at risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Derek had intended to target the Vanderbilt family, hoping to win Alexander's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But seeing Skyla pull Fairchild from the brink of death, he was now filled with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla sneered. "I heard you were shouting pretty loudly before, planning to join forces with them against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Derek's face turned ashen. He stammered, pleading desperately, "Please, Ms. Vanderbilt, save me. I'll stand by you. Protect Ms. Vanderbilt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a wave of his hand, another hundred or so men shifted to stand with the Vanderbilt family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the Vanderbilt family's spirits lifted again, their presence more menacing than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only that, but several other influential figures, some suffering from illnesses themselves or with sick family members, stepped forward to join Skyla's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, oh Alexander, let's see how you fight me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyla laughed and her voice was filled with triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Arlene couldn't help but admire Skyla. She thought, " It was no wonder that someone like Felix, so capable, had come from her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But, despite her admiration, Arlene knew better than anyone that Alexander was no one to underestimate. After all, even Felix had been taken down by him. She felt that Skyla was a little too overconfident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Felix, pointing at Ava with fury in his eyes, shouted, "Where's Alexander? Why is he hiding? Call him out. If he refuses my challenge, I'll wipe you all out first and then go after him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairchild, Derek, and the others, eager to prove their loyalty, all joined in, shouting, "Alexander, come out here! If you're a man, stop hiding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thought you were so tough? Get out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlize's face flushed with anger. She was about to charge forward with her people, but Ava grabbed her arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a little longer. He's almost here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's expression was serious. She couldn't afford to underestimate Skyla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had to wait for Alexander's arrival. Only then would they be able to deal with this situation with absolute certainty.</span></p></div>
