        <h1>Chapter 1156 Gaining Without Cost</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m Alexander, here to see Ms. Hansen.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Upon hearing this, the two security guards trembled in fear, frozen in place.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They both knew that Alexander was close to Rebecca and that he was a leader of Ultimate Alliance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Is there a problem? Can&#x27;t I come in?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s gaze swept over them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Apologies, Mr. Hawthorne. Please, go ahead!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The two security guards immediately apologized and hurriedly stepped aside to let Alexander in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Watching Alexander&#x27;s confident back as he entered, the guards wiped the sweat from their brows. The man&#x27;s presence was simply too overwhelming.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alexander!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Upon seeing him, Rebecca immediately flew into his arms happily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re here!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ava and Lynn were also at Rebecca&#x27;s place. Surprised and happy to see them, Alexander asked, &quot;You didn&#x27;t think to invite me along when you came here?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh, you&#x27;re such a busy man! How could we dare disturb you? Today, Rebecca&#x27;s moving into her new house, so we came to congratulate her. Who knew you&#x27;d come as well?&quot; Ava smiled as she clung to Alexander&#x27;s arm, explaining.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander nodded repeatedly. He had indeed been very busy lately, and if not for the fact that he hadn&#x27;t visited Rebecca in a while, he wouldn&#x27;t have come.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Besides, he had some important matters to discuss with her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Rebecca, does your family have several sugar factories?&quot; Alexander asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rebecca looked at him with some confusion. &quot;Yes. So what?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander smiled, &quot;Perfect. Pack up one of the sugar factories for me. I want to ship all the equipment to Treasure Island.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ah? Why?&quot; Rebecca was shocked and asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aside from Ava and Betty, Alexander hadn&#x27;t shared his future plans with Rebecca, but now, the time had come to give her a warning.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander signaled to Ava, who immediately understood his intention and pulled Rebecca aside to explain.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Rebecca, here&#x27;s the situation...</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sakra Society&#x27;s Yinson has restarted the Apocalypse Project, planning to turn most of humanity into his slaves. He&#x27;s also developed enhancement drugs and has already controlled many wealthy elites.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alexander believes that it won&#x27;t be long before global chaos erupts. So, he&#x27;s been working to turn Treasure Island and Devil Island into doomsday bases.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Rebecca&#x27;s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had heard of the Apocalypse Project and knew a little about the zombie outbreak in the suburbs of Loscity.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she never imagined that Yinson could be so evil.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alexander, what do you need a sugar factory for?&quot; Rebecca was still confused.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander smiled, &quot;Sugar not only provides energy but can also be used to make explosives, which is considered military material.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We can plant sugar crops, but to refine them into sugar, we&#x27;ll need the factories and workers.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rebecca suddenly understood and quickly took out her phone to make a call.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alexander, I&#x27;ve given the order. Not just the sugar factory, but if there are any resources at the Hansen family that you can use, you can have them for free!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander nodded in satisfaction. &quot;Good. When the time comes, we&#x27;ll go to the island together and live our happy life.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rebecca&#x27;s face turned pink, and she shyly glanced at Ava.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ava smiled at her and then playfully rolled her eyes at Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander chuckled, placing his left hand on Rebecca&#x27;s thigh and his right hand gently holding Ava&#x27;s hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lynn, watching from the side, didn&#x27;t say anything, but her intense gaze met with Alexander&#x27;s.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Excited, Alexander couldn&#x27;t help but think of ways to get these three beautiful women to spend time with him. It would be so much fun!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Don&#x27;t get any ideas. There are still many guests coming!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ava pinched him heavily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander pretended to be in pain, shouting loudly, which made the three beauties burst into giggles.</p><p style="text-align:left;">To be honest, Alexander truly didn&#x27;t understand how Ava, Rebecca, and Lynn all got along so well together.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It must be my charm. They can&#x27;t resist me.&quot; Alexander thought proudly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Let&#x27;s go, we&#x27;re going swimming!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rebecca pulled Ava and Lynn toward the pool at the back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alexander, you should join us!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Swimming? Didn&#x27;t you say there were other guests coming? Is it a pool party?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander quickly followed them, eager to feast his eyes on the fun that awaited.</p></div>
