        <h1>Chapter 170 Changes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>'s beauty and figure were just as striking as Ava's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two of them appeared together, it sparked a little excitement in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Lara</span><span>! You're here! I haven't seen you in days, and you didn't pick up my calls!" Ava exclaimed, rushing over to greet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> felt a swirl of emotions. She had been avoiding Ava, feeling guilty about her relationship with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just a business..." she reassured herself internally before putting on a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, I've been under the weather and just needed some time to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two friends stood side by side, radiating beauty and charm, making heads turn among the men present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Hansen, it's been a while since I last visited. It's great to see you!" Ava greeted Ralph Hansen with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph smiled warmly, taking Ava's hand and giving it a gentle squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a soft spot for Ava and encouraged his granddaughter to forge a close friendship with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sad reality for children from prominent families was that even friendships required approval from their elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, how are things going with Alexander? Have you two... you know... taken it to the next level?" </span><span>Lara</span><span> asked, her cheeks flushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava paused, playfully scolding her friend, "What are you thinking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not quite there yet, but it's getting close... Why do you ask all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>'s face turned even redder as she replied, "Oh, it's nothing! I was just curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, I think Alexander must be quite... impressive in that department, and I'm sure you're feeling the heat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's eyes widened for a moment before she playfully started tickling </span><span>Lara</span><span> at her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Lara</span><span>, even you are picking on me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> couldn't help but retaliate, and soon they were giggling and playfully shoving each other, their swaying boobs drawing the attention of the men around them, who couldn't help but gawk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, once you and Alexander are officially together, you'll be so wrapped up in him that we might drift apart," </span><span>Lara</span><span> said, her expression turning a bit somber, lost in her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava understood that despite being the first heir of the Hansen family, </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s life wasn't as glamorous as it seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion had already taken control of much of the Hansen family's power, and if Ralph were to pass, </span><span>Lara</span><span> would be in a precarious position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Alexander and I will always have your back," Ava reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>'s face lit up, and she linked her arm with Ava's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You promise? And Alexander will help me, too? We can all stick together forever, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't quite grasp the deeper meaning behind </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s words but nodded enthusiastically. "Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Alexander? Isn't he here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After relaxing a bit, </span><span>Lara</span><span> began scanning the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, he's over there, enjoying some food..." Ava said, nodding toward Alexander with a tone full of affection and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As </span><span>Lara</span><span> followed Ava toward Alexander, she felt her cheeks heat up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer she got to </span><span>him,</span><span> the more memories of their wild night together flooded her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had given herself to him under the influence of a dark sorcerer's curse, it was still her first time, and the impression it left was unforgettable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their arrangement felt like a bond tying them closely together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>'s aroma wafted through the air. Alexander had sensed her arrival but was feeling a bit awkward, so he pretended not to notice her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When </span><span>Lara</span><span> stood in front of him, her gaze locked onto his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, </span><span>Lara</span><span>," Alexander said, his face flushing as he quickly stood up to greet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi," </span><span>Lara</span><span> replied, equally embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava suddenly sensed something was off. The dynamic between Alexander and </span><span>Lara</span><span> had shifted; it wasn't as tense as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span>, who had always looked down on Alexander, was now displaying a bashful demeanor, and Alexander's tone with her felt unusually intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's keen intuition kicked in, and she realized there was a secret between the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the three of them stood there, caught in an awkward silence, unsure of </span><span>what to say next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caught Ava's questioning gaze and quickly explained, "Ava, you know </span><span>Lara</span><span> came to me the other day, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She asked me to help her become the head of the Hansen family, and I agreed to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's expression softened as understanding dawned. "Ah, that makes sense. You should definitely help her then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If </span><span>Lara</span><span> takes the reins, it'll be a huge boon for all of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> flashed Alexander a grateful look and subtly gave his thigh a gentle squeeze.</span></p></div>
