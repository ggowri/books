        <h1>Chapter 378 Appreciation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava shyly pushed Alexander away and then sank her whole body into the hot spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled her back into his arms, holding her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you... Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's words were cut short as Alexander covered her lips with his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Ava melted into Alexander's embrace, her arms wrapping around his neck...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hours flew by, and now it was late at night as Alexander finally walked out, his arm around a flushed Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava playfully complained, "It's all your fault. I've got no strength left, and my legs are shaking. Are you some kind of bull? You wore me out over and over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling </span><span>you,</span><span> we can't do this so many times. I won't make it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander teased, "Aren't you afraid I'll get hungry and go looking elsewhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes, replying sarcastically, "You mean you aren't already? I haven't called you out because I want you to unwind. It's just as long as your heart is with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly felt a sense of relief. Otherwise, he sometimes felt a bit guilty when he was around Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, your ride awaits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security team escorted them to the car with great respect, even assigning two cars to escort them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the van parked in the distance. With these escort cars, whoever was following them wouldn't make a move now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad, or Alexander would have enjoyed teaching them a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, the van tailed them for a while before turning off onto another road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked; these guys would definitely show up again. He just had to wait for them to walk into his trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they returned to the villa, an exhausted Ava retired early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately called Augusta, Logan, Marvin, and William over, with Betty, Charlize, and Rosalia also present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta started by updating Alexander on the current situation. The Ultimate Alliance had expanded to 500 members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of them, 200 had completed basic special operations training and could now be considered elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was very pleased and rewarded Augusta with a vial of power elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power elixir Alexander had was refined with Force, making it free from side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, he diluted each dose so that several people could share it safely without any risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander commanded, "Augusta, you and William take these 200 elites to Treasure Island to help Cloe wipe out the Red Umbrella Group's forces there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and William were overjoyed; they had been itching for an opportunity to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander providing them with great pay and power-boosting elixirs, they were constantly looking for ways to make a big impact and earn his praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Betty reported on the sales of the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, the magic powder has reached dozens of states, with a sales network now covering counties nationwide. So far, we've made a net profit of three billion dollars..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe that in just over a month, they had generated billions in profit, with shares of the revenue awaiting them&mdash;a staggering sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a calm, slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, we need to increase the production of the magic powder, as the military will be requesting large quantities soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty nodded enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Boss. I'm gradually ramping up production. Although we're selling to the military at a much lower price, the high volume and steady demand will make it very profitable over time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a firm reminder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The formula must be kept confidential. You're responsible for adding the key </span><span>ingredients yourself. No one else can handle them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty immediately knelt on one knee, her expression serious, and said, "Thank you for trusting me, Boss. I'll protect the formula with my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but glance at Betty's neckline, where her full chest was slightly visible, causing a sudden tightness in his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Alexander's heated gaze, Betty remembered the ecstasy of their previous encounters, warmth spreading down her legs, almost making her let out a soft gasp.</span></p></div>
