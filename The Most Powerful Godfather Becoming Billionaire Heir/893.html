        <h1>Chapter 893 Take Her Back</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian still said calmly, "Don't worry, Locke is the most experienced and powerful man in Mafia. I believe in his ability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was nervous, she would not say it out so as not to disrupt the morale of the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen Mafia members looked nervous and tried to be focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything happened to Vivian, their whole family would suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the heavy rain slowly stopped, and the gunfire ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man shouted, "Ms. Hawkins, it seems, it seems that someone is coming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared ahead with eyes wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three figures appeared in the distance and ran towards them very quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who! Is it Locke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man quickly raised his gun and aimed in the direction of the people coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian's body trembled, and her face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Brandon's daughter and was also quite powerful, vaguely seeing who the people were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Mafia members were stunned and terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched Alexander coming in front of them with Shadow and Marvin, too shocked even to fire a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaped up like a bird and landed in front of Vivian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the wind, heavy breathing filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't hurt Ms. Hawkins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man raised his gun and was about to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, why are you so emotional?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his hand and swung the machete over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a flash of lightning that streaked through the void and easily pierced into the bald man's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The considerable inertia carried the bald man up into the air and then nailed him to the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The machete was deeply embedded in the concrete wall, which showed how powerful Alexander's casual attack was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large pool of blood gushed out, flowing on the ground and spreading...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smell of blood was pungent in the fresh air after the rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was dead silence. All the Mafia members dared not say a word or take any action. Vivian's face was pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to die, get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin slapped them in the face one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few guys standing in front of Vivian fell out one after another, spitting blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Piss off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow also kicked several people one by one and sent them flying, and they all lay on the ground, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a battle that almost killed them, both of them had made significant progress in strength, which was a blessing in disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Marvin, who, at the most dangerous moment, broke through his potential and burst out with a powerful force beyond his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he couldn't maintain that burning state now, he could do it again since he had done it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin's power would be fearsome once he could access his peak state at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ability gained by breaking through one's potential was much more potent than the superpowers gained by taking power elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, it was forced by the situation and also a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marvin was put in a death situation again, he might not be able to break out like he did just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are Brandon's daughter? Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hooked his finger at Vivian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What...what do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian's expression was extremely dark. Although she had poison needles, a pistol, a dagger, and even dozens of ways to poison people instantly, she did not have any courage to attack Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's deep eyes seemed to be able to see through her heart, and the evil smile on the corner of his mouth made her shiver all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian walked slowly and carefully in front of Alexander, lowered her head obediently, and didn't even dare to look at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look me in the eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a stern order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian trembled, daring not to resist. She subconsciously raised her head and looked into Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Vivian's eyes became dull and confused. Influenced by Alexander's Force Control, an anchor of submission was planted in her spiritual world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian suddenly felt that Alexander was not so scary anymore and even had a little admiration for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She panicked and stammered, "What... What did you do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored her and waved to Marvin. "Take her back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian was Brandon's daughter, so she would be a useful pawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She excelled in poison and assassination, a cruel beauty, yet Alexander remained unfazed.</span></p></div>
