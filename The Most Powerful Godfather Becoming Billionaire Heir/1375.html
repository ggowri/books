        <h1>Chapter 1375 Taking a Household Servant</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander went through all his techniques&mdash;Arhat Fist, Dragonhell Staff, Schneier Harmonic Fist, Vardaanian Yoga... one after another. Once he had fully completed the Marrow-Cleansing Classic, he couldn't help but leap to his feet, an overwhelming sense of joy surging in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level-four warrior had fully integrated the Force into their bones and meridians, refining their marrow to a frost-like state, their blood thick and pure like liquid mercury. Their body was reborn&mdash;bones as strong as steel, reflexes sharpened to perfection. They had reached mastery in martial arts, capable of establishing their own school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His doubts had been cleared, and his martial heart had ascended to a new level&mdash;steady and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From here, his martial path would progress at an incredible pace. No matter how powerful a warrior became, if their heart was clouded and their virtue lacking, they would ultimately fall into darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His previous encounter with Rhodes, a near-level-five warrior, had nearly cost him his life. But the golden energy within him had awakened, boosting his strength like that of a Saiyan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, after hearing the sacred teachings, the mysterious golden energy merged entirely with the Force, seeping into his meridians, bones, and blood. He couldn't resist testing his resilience with a steel dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles and bones now rivaled those of a near-level-five warrior like Rhodes. Strangely, instead of silver specks in his blood, fine golden threads shimmered within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I truly on my way to achieving a full golden body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander murmured to himself, unable to resist pulling open his shirt. The golden energy over his left chest had become even clearer. It was unmistakably a humanoid figure, holding a long staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp glint flashed in Alexander's eyes. He clenched his fists tightly. He had officially stepped into the ranks of level-four warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my mysterious golden energy and energy waves, I might even stand a chance against a near-level-five warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was early autumn, Logan had already reached peak level-two warrior status, and Alexander was currently sparring with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A servant rushed in and reported, "Sir, the bandit leader we captured last time is asking to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's probably at his limit. Looks like Earth's interrogation methods still work. Alexander nodded and ordered him to be brought in. Before long, Josh was dragged into the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was unkempt and gaunt, reeking of filth. His sunken eyes were bloodshot, and his cracked lips twisted into a pitiful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His former fierceness had long since faded, replaced by a deathly pallor. His skin was dull and lifeless, as if covered in a layer of ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh knelt in the center of the hall, looking up at Alexander. His gaze was a tangled mess of reverence, regret, fear, and anger as he slowly spoke, "Sir, I am Josh, leader of Tiger Gang. I beg you, please spare my son!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained expressionless. He picked up his cup and took a sip, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh gritted his teeth and said grimly, "It was Marshal Wetherall who sent us! We pledged our loyalty to him, carried out his orders, and in return, he protected us. That's the only reason the royal army didn't wipe out Tiger Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the son won't do it, the father will." Logan muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the bandit leader, his expression darkening. He asked slowly, "So you expect me to let you go just because of a few words? And on top of that, you want me to go up against the Marshal in a life-or-death battle? Is that what you're saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh froze for a moment before dropping his head to the ground with a heavy thud. In a low voice, he said, "If you spare my son, I will offer you all of Tiger Gang's hidden treasures... and pledge myself to you as a servant for life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level-four warrior willingly becoming someone's servant? If word got out, people would think he'd lost his mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked inwardly. This was exactly the outcome he had hoped for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his storage pouch and pulled out a silver waist token, instructing a servant to hand it to Josh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josh, I'm giving you one chance. Drip your blood onto this token and swear loyalty to me as your master. Do that, and I'll spare both you and your son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bandit leader stared at the silver waist token in his hand, his expression shifting rapidly. After a brief hesitation, he bit down hard on his finger, letting a drop of blood fall onto the token. Then, he swore a binding oath, pledging his allegiance to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the oath was complete, the silver token emitted a faint, seven-colored glow, and the distant chime of bells and wooden fish drums echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh was suddenly overwhelmed by an inexplicable sense of devotion. This young man before him now felt like the most important person in his life. He realized he could no longer harbor any ill will toward him. As long as the task wasn't something evil or criminal, he would gladly do anything Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander observed Josh's obedient expression as he respectfully handed the waist token back. A sense of satisfaction welled up in Alexander's heart. This token wasn't just a symbol of servitude. It was a Teleportation Plate, capable of instantaneous transport. It also granted him an additional 1,000 martial virtue points every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that he had reached level four, he had begun to understand an additional mystery within the token. It could channel divine energy, allowing him to subjugate warriors up to level five as household servants.</span></p></div>
