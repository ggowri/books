        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo smiled and nodded, pulling out a wooden plate and handing it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took it and examined it closely. The two plates bore the same engravings, but the materials were different; his copper plate seemed more refined than the wooden one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "It's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your understanding," Arturo replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, several Risunese quickly approached, bowing to Alexander one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand gently, a warm smile on his face. "I appreciate your hard work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese bowed deeper and chimed in unison, "It's our pleasure, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their strange accent made him stifle a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to help himself, Alexander burst into laughter. The Risunese, seeing his unprompted joy, joined in the laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed Arturo and Reece as they climbed aboard the last carriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he entered, he spotted someone in the corner&mdash;Isolde, the missing lady. Her hair was a mess, and a towel was stuffed in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear painted her face; her bright eyes were brimming with tears, her lips pale, and her once graceful figure was tightly bound with several ropes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a rush of heat rise to his cheeks for no apparent reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Isolde noticed him, her eyes widened in terror, and she began to make muffled sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander winked at her, then patted Arturo on the shoulder, grinning. "She's quite a catch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reece narrowed his eyes, a lecherous grin spreading across his face. "Mr. Hawthorne, this woman seems to have an impressive background. I suspect she's someone significant in the palace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo chuckled, his voice low and gravelly. "If you're intrigued, just wait in a safe spot and inquire about her background. She'll be at your service."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the three men exchanged knowing looks and shared a hearty, lewd laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde shivered, casting a surprised and doubtful glance at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The carriages rolled forward for a while before coming to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Risunese disembarked, and from the three carriages in front, more than a dozen women stumbled out, all looking just as disheveled and terrified as Isolde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Aren't you all leaving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo offered a mysterious smile. "We're headed to the mountains. You'll understand once we get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't press further, counting silently in his mind. There were Arturo, Reece, three Risunese ronin, and four Risunese dancers, making a total of nine. The one who had just been killed brought the number to 10.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo pointed to another mountain road and instructed the drivers, "Take that route, then do this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde and the other women were driven deep into Walgus Hill by the Risunese, while several of them trailed behind, erasing any signs of their passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strolled along leisurely with the group. Reece kept a close eye on him, and Arturo occasionally turned back to smile at him, though his expression was uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Alexander scoffed, "These two Risunese are still wary of me. They're sharp. I can't leave any traces now&mdash;too risky. I hope Logan is faring well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, Ruben, and the others had been searching fruitlessly until they received word from Alexander's messenger, finally pinpointing the direction of the carriage and the secret trail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They then teamed up with Zain, Seth, Troy, and others, following the trail all the way down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the pine forest at the foot of Walgus Hill, Zain suddenly halted, leaving everyone puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surveyed several pine trees that were snapped in half, then crouched down to inspect the ground more closely. Dark red bloodstains were still visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dipped his fingers into the dried blood, rubbed them together, and said slowly, "There was a fierce fight here about four hours ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan shouted urgently, "Mr. Dunne, we need to save Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zain reassured him, "Don't worry, Logan. Alexander is a man of great integrity, and I will certainly protect him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group scoured the forest meticulously. Although they didn't find Alexander's secret mark, the recent rain had left the pine forest lush, and the soil wasn't completely dry, revealing faint traces of wheel tracks. Everyone felt a flicker of hope and followed the tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, deep in Walgus Hill, Alexander gazed up at the sky, which was beginning to lighten. He noticed a structure vaguely outlined in the distance. As he approached, he realized it was a church.</span></p></div>
