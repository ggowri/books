        <h1>Chapter 1177 Royal Chef</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for all your hard work during this time." Alexander patted William's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my pleasure working for you," William replied with a beaming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe glanced at the time and said cheerfully, "Boss, there's a famous restaurant on the island that is said to have a Michelin three-star rating. Let's have lunch there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to look at her. Cloe had done her makeup beautifully today, making her already stunning face even more charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a white shirt and a fitted skirt, topped with a knee-length trench coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voluptuous and sexy figure peeked out, with graceful curves that particularly attracted men's gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William chimed in, "Boss, I heard that restaurant is great. It has a chef who is particularly skilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That place is always crowded. Logan and I went there once, and it took us a long time to get a table."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander wasn't very interested in gourmet food, seeing how highly Cloe and William praised the restaurant piqued his interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked ahead while Cloe gently leaned against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William lagged a couple of steps behind, keeping a vigilant eye on their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you've been so busy lately. Finally, you have time to see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's expression showed a hint of melancholy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and pinched her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for taking care of everything for me here. Seeing Treasure Island thrive, I know you have put in a lot of effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already asked Ava to prepare to move the Saint Group's headquarters from </span><span>Loscity</span><span> to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe in less than a month, and Treasure Island will truly become our base."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was excited upon hearing this. "Great! That way, I can see you every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then her expression changed, and she quietly asked with concern, "Boss, will Yinson really cause a global catastrophe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed seriously, "You'll see soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two then fell silent, and the atmosphere grew heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe couldn't help but link her arm with Alexander's, smiling as she said, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't bring up such unhappy topics. You're rarely here, and I still mention such disheartening things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her watery eyes fixed on Alexander, thinking, "He is my first man and will definitely be my last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, and the feeling of satisfaction within him was indescribable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walking down the commercial street of Treasure Island, Alexander felt nostalgic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place, which used to be dirty and chaotic, had now transformed into a bustling marketplace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though people came and went, lively and busy, there was not a scrap of paper in sight, and the order was well maintained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the three arrived at the popular restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan had made a reservation. I heard that the chef comes from a lineage of imperial chefs and has inherited culinary skills, which is why he receives such acclaim," Cloe explained to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An imperial chef? Not bad. It seems I have good fortune today to eat what the emperor dined on." Alexander was also looking forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William swallowed hard and said proudly, "Thank goodness Logan reserved a spot in advance. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to eat here even with money. There's a limit on the number of guests served daily, and they only accommodate according to the reservation times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "Good, it should be great then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the three discussed, they walked into the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant was decorated with a traditional imperial atmosphere, featuring exquisite murals, luxurious lighting, and lavish carpets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A server at the entrance raised a hand to stop Alexander and said with a smile, "Our restaurant operates on a reservation basis. May I ask how many of you have a reservation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, they are with me," Logan called out from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood near the entrance, watching the situation outside. Upon seeing Alexander and the others, he immediately raised his hand with the reservation card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so you are Mr. Ridley's esteemed guests. My apologies. Please come in." The server quickly allowed them through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, long time no see." Logan approached with a beaming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted his shoulder, offering some compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman dressed in court attire led the way, guiding the four of them inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant was spacious, even featuring green plants, fountains, fish ponds, and more, creating a beautiful and artistic environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, hello!" Several executives from Treasure Island had been waiting there. As soon as they saw Alexander, they immediately nodded and bowed, smiling flatteringly.</span></p></div>
