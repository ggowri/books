        <h1>Chapter 1162 Devils Among Us</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to pin Alin down and strip her clothes off, a thunderous voice cut through the room. "Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked the door wide open, his eyes blazing with cold fury as he stared down Raymond and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you? What's your problem?" Raymond growled, glaring at Alexander. He'd been ready to screw Alin up, and this interruption was seriously pissing him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god, Alexander! What are you doing here?" Alin instantly recognized the man standing before them. Her cheeks burned with shame and anger, wishing she could just disappear into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she remembered Alexander's status and wealth, and a flicker of hope sparked inside her. Maybe she had a chance after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd considered asking Alexander for help back then, but a kidney transplant would cost millions of dollars. Since they weren't particularly close, she figured he wouldn't want to help anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carl jabbed a finger at Alexander as he turned to Raymond. "Boss, this guy must've followed me here. We can't let him walk away like that. We need to get him and make him talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I don't care who he is. Just get him!" Raymond's face twisted into a cruel grin. "Hearts, livers, kidneys, corneas</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>it all sells. When millions of dollars walk </span><span>right through your door, you take it!" He let out a harsh laugh and waved his hand. "Get him! Take him straight to the operating room and harvest everything we can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carl and his five buddies lunged at Alexander like a pack of wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked and then slammed his foot into Carl's stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carl let out a scream as he went flying backward. The room filled with groans and thuds as bodies hit the floor. Alexander took them all down without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Raymond ended up face-down after Alexander backhanded him. Not only did he lose a few teeth, but half his face swelled up like a balloon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected Alexander to be such a beast in a fight. Their whole group hadn't stood a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond frantically called out, "Hey, buddy, stop! Let's talk this through. I'll give you money, just name your price! Fifty grand? A hundred grand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or how about this? You work for me, and I'll pay you fifty grand a month </span><span>plus year-end bonuses</span><span>. Your annual salary won't be less than a million dollars. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond tried to tempt Alexander, thinking someone with such fighting skills would be a valuable asset to his organ trafficking business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Work for you?" Alexander let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of all the things you could do, you chose to kidnap people for their organs. The devil walks among us, indeed. Keep your million-dollar salary. Use it to buy yourself a grave plot instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's kick sent Raymond flying across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond shot through the air like a cannonball, violently colliding with the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander methodically disabled each of these criminals, breaking their arms and legs until they couldn't even crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! You monster, why are you doing this to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, have mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room filled with howls and desperate pleas for mercy from Carl and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored them, walking finally toward Raymond, who lay sprawled on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond suddenly whirled around, pulling a gun from under the couch and aiming it at Alexander. "You bastard! I'll kill you!" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted with rage as he pulled the trigger. As the sharp crack rang out, a smug smile spread across Raymond's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two bullets streaked toward Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While ordinary people couldn't track flying bullets, they appeared in crystal clarity to Alexander's enhanced vision. Even without using the Force Confinement, he could have easily dodged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Alexander flicked his toe, sending one of the men lying on the floor flying upward, perfectly intercepting both bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets tore into the man's body with two thuds, spraying blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond froze for a moment and then exploded with fury, firing wildly at Alexander </span><span>until he emptied the entire clip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lightly stamped his foot, sending a wave of Force energy into another fallen man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy sprang up from the ground like a coiled spring, his body intercepting every single bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time everyone came to their senses, one of the men lay dead in a pool of blood, gunned down by Raymond's own bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You're a monster!" Raymond screamed in terror, frantically trying to reload his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander appeared in front of Raymond in an instant, kicking him to the ground. The gun went flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Raymond struggled to get up, Alexander grabbed his head and gave it a slight twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of breaking vertebrae echoed through the room. Raymond's face was now completely turned toward his back, his eyes bulging wide.</span></p></div>
