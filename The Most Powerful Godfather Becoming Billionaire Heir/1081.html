        <h1>Chapter 1081 Let's Do It</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the only way to save her husband and protect her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was too inexperienced, too </span><span>young</span><span> to pull this off. Everything would have to rest on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma took a deep breath and looked up at Alexander with a seductive smile. Her beautiful eyes curved like crescent moons, her charm radiating like a spring breeze&mdash;the kind of look that was impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those sparkling, flirtatious eyes seemed to be having their own private conversation with Alexander across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander froze for a moment. Having been around so many women, he instantly recognized what that look meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did I do?" he wondered. "I don't think I've done anything inappropriate</span><span> to mislead her</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander found himself mentally reviewing every interaction since meeting Emma. He'd been </span><span>very </span><span>polite</span><span> all the time. H</span><span>e hadn't even </span><span>got some dirty</span><span> thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's expression and gaze stirred </span><span>dark energy</span><span> </span><span>hiding in</span><span> Alexander's</span><span> deep heart</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught himself licking his lips and quickly suppressed the </span><span>lust</span><span> rising within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne? What were you thinking just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's voice snapped Alexander back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My apologies," he said smoothly, his gaze involuntarily trailing across her chest. "Got caught up in a thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, don't worry about it!" Emma raised her glass with a flirtatious wink. "Let's have a toast</span><span>. Thanks for </span><span>helping us out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cheers," he replied simply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their glasses clinked together, and the atmosphere shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander around, it was like someone had flipped a switch in Maxine. She transformed into a chatterbox, words spilling out like a songbird that couldn't quite help itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no, I dropped my spoon!" Emma suddenly exclaimed, lightly nudging Alexander's arm with an apologetic smile. "Mr. Hawthorne, it fell over to your side. Could you please help me pick it up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bent down, slipping under the tablecloth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spoon hadn't fallen far</span><span>. I</span><span>t was right between Emma and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he picked it up, his gaze accidentally shifted toward Emma. The moment he looked up, his eyes widened, and a blazing fire ignited in his chest, roaring uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's skirt was partly tucked under her, and because she was sitting cross-legged, not only were her smooth thighs fully visible, but a generous portion of her butt was as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her skin, faint blue capillaries were just visible, leaving nothing to the imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a slut! Emma wasn't wearing any underwear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but feel his blood rushing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swallow</span><span>ed</span><span> hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma noticed Alexander blushing and staring dumbfounded in her direction. Her </span><span>own cheeks turned red, but she deliberately lifted her skirt slightly, giving Alexander an even clearer view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Alexander understood</span><span> it. </span><span>Emma was </span><span>totally </span><span>seducing him, and she was doing it right in front of her </span><span>young </span><span>daughter, Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a sudden pang of guilt, like a thief afraid of being caught, he quickly grabbed the spoon and looked upward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head smacked hard against the edge of the table with a loud bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma burst into laughter, her smile blooming like a rose in full bloom. In that instant, her charm and allure made Alexander's heart race uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head, trying his best not to let the dark energy within him take control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, are you okay?" Maxine asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand dismissively. "I'm fine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma covered her mouth and giggled softly. The way she looked at Alexander now carried a new, subtle hint of ambiguity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, why is your face so red?" Maxine suddenly asked with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face turned even redder as she quickly covered her cheeks with both hands, nervously replying, "Is it? I don't think so... Maybe it's because I just took a hot shower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine didn't seem to mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, the three of them went back to their respective rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's room was closest to the stairs, so she entered first and shut the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's room was next to Emma's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, my neck pain is acting up again, and my shoulders feel so stiff. Could you give me a quick massage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma spoke while fixing Alexander with a gaze that was both alluring and irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander froze for a moment, and the desire he had just managed to suppress began to stir again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to politely decline, but before he could, Emma took the initiative, grabbing his arm and pulling him toward her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile on her enchanting face, Emma swayed her waist, her rounded hips moving in a subtle rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, slightly entranced, followed behind her, his eyes repeatedly drawn to the curve of her swaying hips. A sudden </span><span>lust </span><span>flame ignited in his chest, leaving him parched and restless.</span></p></div>
