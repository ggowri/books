        <h1>Chapter 101 Unreality</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's face darkened when he spotted him - Nick Portman, his aunt Lily's good-for-nothing son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone knew Nick - the kind of guy who'd bet his own mother if he could, living it up in clubs while his debts piled sky-high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd burned through his family's fortune like it was paper, then had the nerve to use the bank's good name to con people. Every time he messed up, poor Aunt Lily would come running with her checkbook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick came at him like a shark smelling blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, well, Alexander. Got yourself a fat 100 grand? Bet that old witch Lily handed it over, didn't she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch your mouth, Nick. Talking about your own mother like that - you're worse than an animal!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander spat the words and tried pushing past him to the counter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Nick planted himself like a wall in Alexander's path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hold up! Are you saying you actually have 100 thousand dollars? With your pathetic ability, there's no way you could have that much. Did that old bag secretly give it to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fury surged through Alexander. If it weren't for Lily, he would have slapped Nick across the face already.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost! I'm a diamond VIP at your bank. You have no right to stop me or question me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick snickered, his disdain palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! You're a diamond VIP? You've lost your mind. You need at least 100 million in the bank to be a diamond VIP. Let's be real&mdash;you'll never see that kind of money, not in this life or the next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard your wife cheated on you, and your daughter isn't even yours. Is that what's driving you crazy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander clenched his fists, his icy glare fixed on Nick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm giving you a chance to apologize, just because of Aunt Lily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick laughed derisively. "Apologize? Why the hell would I do that? You're nothing but a loser, probably don't even have a thousand dollars in your account, and you dare to pretend to be our diamond VIP? Get the hell out of here, or I'll call security!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was it. Alexander could no longer hold back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pulled out his phone and dialed the beautiful customer service representative he had spoken to earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The phone rang once before it was answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice, bright and surprised, came through. "Mr. Hawthorne, have you changed your mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She clearly still fantasized about a romantic encounter with this young billionaire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm here to withdraw money, and your lobby manager's attitude is unacceptable. He just told me to get lost. I'll be suing your bank, so you might want to prepare for a lawyer's letter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Alexander hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! Alexander, what a joke! Who do you think you're fooling? Everyone knows you're a freeloader. A broke loser trying to act tough in front of me? It's hilarious, really..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick's arrogance was unyielding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moments later, hurried footsteps echoed through the lobby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A stunning woman in her late twenties, dressed in bank attire, rushed in behind a balding man in a suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nick, what are you doing? How dare you insult our VIP?" the middle-aged man scolded angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Jones, what are you doing here? I didn't insult anyone, I swear!" Nick stammered, confusion etched on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that the customer service representative had immediately reported Alexander's call to the bank president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel Jones had initially brushed it off, thinking Alexander's account was just over 100 million.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when he realized Alexander was only in his twenties, his demeanor shifted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A young man with over 100 million in cash could either be a rising star or the heir to a vast family fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was why Samuel rushed over, anxious to get to the bottom of this situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick was in full swing, desperately trying to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Jones, are you buying into this guy's BS too? He's just a lowlife leeching off women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He said he's here for 100 thousand&mdash;total scam, probably aiming for a heist. Lucky for me, I saw through his plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Security! Security, get over here, we got a possible robber on our hands!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick was blatantly accusing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samuel's face darkened further, his voice thundering with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut your trap, you fool! You must be out of your mind. Mr. Hawthorne is a diamond VIP of our bank. Nick, are you seriously defaming our esteemed Mr. Hawthorne as a robber? Are you itching for a pink slip and a one-way ticket to jail?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? No... that can't be!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nick's world seemed to crack and crumble around him as he felt an eerie unreality set in.</p></div>
