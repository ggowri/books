        <h1>Chapter 813 Turned on</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh dear, I've trained you so many times, but you've become even more sensitive. This isn't going to end well." Lynn was really worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava huffed. "Isn't it because of you? You don't want to train me anymore. Actually, you just care too much about Alexander and don't want him to find another woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn's face turned red, and she was at a loss for words. She could only assert her authority as a mother and order, "Lie down on the bed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava didn't say no and obediently lay down on the large bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn also climbed into bed and lay down next to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Four shapely legs crossed each other, pressing tightly together below the stomach, rubbing rhythmically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't long before the bedroom was filled with sticky sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! I feel so good..." Ava couldn't help but moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have to hold it in, okay?" Lynn's voice trembled as she spoke, telling Ava to hold on while rubbing her own breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Ava was trembling all over. "Ah! Stop, or I'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn's voice trembled even more, clearly indicating that she was also on the verge of climax. "Hold on, you need to hold on. Only then can you improve your ability to face off against Alexander..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, hearing this from outside the door, almost couldn't hold back his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn couldn't help but rub Ava's body fiercely a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had orgasms almost at the same time with blank minds. Pressing their bodies together, they didn't even realize they had made the sheet wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn panted and asked, "Ava, what happened to us today? Why did we come so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava was still savoring the wonderful afterglow. "I don't know either. Maybe... it's because we miss Alexander so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn sighed, "I think so. Well, let's take a break and have another round later. You must last longer this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They lay down for a while. Lynn supported herself and sat up. Then she took out a very special pair of leather underwear from the shopping bag while looking at her daughter with a seductive smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were two black protrusions in the crotch of the underwear, one large and the other small. They all looked amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn looked at Ava with a smile and said, "Ava, it's your turn now, but you must hold on. This one has an electric motor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, who was secretly watching from outside, couldn't help but open his mouth wide, thinking, "She is indeed an experienced slut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava looked at the underwear in Lynn's hand and said with timidity, "Mom, I don't want that. It's too scary. I'm afraid I can't take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn immediately put on a serious face and said, "This proves that I made the right purchase. Only this way can you improve your abilities and satisfy Alexander, making sure he won't find any other woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava had no choice but to take it and put it on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn had not pressed the electric button, but Ava's breathing began to rough up, her desire aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Ava was squinting her eyes, ready to enjoy, Lynn suddenly pulled her hands up and placed them on top of her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's hands were handcuffed to the bed rail, which frightened her terribly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Mom, what... what are you going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn smiled mysteriously and said, "I've studied this. If you're restrained like this, the sensation becomes much more intense. So, using this method for training will definitely be very effective."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lay down on Ava, caressing and kissing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, where did you learn all these weird things?" Ava couldn't control her trembling body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn took out the remote control and warned, "Ava, you have to hold on. How about I set it to medium?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the sound of a motor vibrating filled the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander saw the two protrusions on the underwear, a large amount of forward and backward movements with rotation and vibration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava suddenly opened her mouth, her body tensed up, and she kept shaking. "Ah... It feels so good... Help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lynn ignored her and continued adjusting the remote control, switching between vibration mode, rotation mode, high setting, and medium setting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava was made speechless, full of sweat. She had two orgasms during a short period of time.</span></p></div>
