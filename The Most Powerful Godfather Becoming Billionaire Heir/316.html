        <h1>Chapter 316 Submission</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew you were only pretending to be weak&mdash;well done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Alexander swiftly pinched the knife between two fingers, stopping it cold despite her best effort to push it forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all happened in a flash, quicker than a single breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's final attempt at an ambush also failed; despite her resolve and surprise attack, she hadn't managed to harm Alexander at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman should know her limits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed sharply as a powerful force surged from within him, instantly pressing down on Rosalia like a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by the terrifying pressure, Rosalia collapsed to her knees, looking up at Alexander in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple motion, Alexander slapped his hand forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she knew it, Rosalia was airborne, spinning through the air before crashing hard onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tap, tap..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Footsteps echoed as Alexander calmly approached, towering over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a rich, intoxicating scent filled the air, pleasant and soothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>... don't you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia took the chance to let out a soft, alluring moan as if teasing Alexander's heart and tickling his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate, seductive body coiled around him like a water snake, exploring him from head to toe with intense provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fragrance in the air wasn't innocent; Rosalia had used some sort of aphrodisiac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heat flared in Alexander's abdomen, and a wave of desire rushed over him, triggering a strong reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think a mere aphrodisiac can control me!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold snort and kicked her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cry, Rosalia spat out blood, rolling a few times on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skilled and cunning&mdash;a useful asset if tamed," Alexander thought, feeling a genuine interest in her potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crouching down, he checked her injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's body was burning like fire, and an unusual blush colored her pale face&mdash;a side effect of her own drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... it's so hot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a seductive sound like a cat in heat, her voice so alluring it made any man's heart tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's consciousness began to blur, and Alexander's eyes gleamed&mdash;this was the perfect chance to guide her into submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Controlling a strong-willed woman like her wouldn't be as easy as controlling someone like Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Alexander's powers had grown significantly, though this would still be a unique challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, Alexander pressed a finger to Rosalia's forehead, unleashing a torrent of force that surged through her entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, the effects of the aphrodisiac within Rosalia subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a deep breath and slowly opened her eyes; the first thing she saw was Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, Rosalia gasped and tried to escape, but Alexander gripped her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look into my eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander commanded with an indisputable tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia struggled, but her gaze met him, and suddenly, her mind felt cloudy as if an endless abyss in his eyes were drawing into her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to live, obey me from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unleashed his full force, pushing his control to the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's will be strong, the strongest Alexander had encountered thus far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, weakened and valuing her life, she understood that surrendering to Alexander was her only path to survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an initial struggle, her fierce resistance waned, her furious gaze becoming calm and peaceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Alexander successfully took control of her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander released his grip, Rosalia collapsed, sitting on the ground in a daze, unsure if anything had happened or if it had all been a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you're now my subordinate. Betrayal means death!" Alexander declared with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia immediately bowed, showing her respect, yet couldn't help glancing up at the towering presence Alexander cast before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's naked body was truly beautiful, and because she was bowing, her ample and plump chest hung slightly, making her even more alluring. Her round and full buttocks swayed, causing Alexander's heart to beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gulp..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but swallow.</span></p></div>
