        <h1>Chapter 1195 Down on Their Knees</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pure chaos erupted as Alexander seemed to vanish into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only trace of him was his cold laughter echoing through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really your trump card? Do you really think such amateur attacks will work on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone frantically searched for Alexander, but he was nowhere to be seen. His voice seemed to come from everywhere at once, bouncing off the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory's face had turned ashen. Sure, Yinson had warned him, but Alexander was way more badass than anyone had let on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen or so gunmen in black had emptied their clips, leaving bullet holes everywhere</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>and hadn't managed to land a single hit on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were fumbling to reload, and their hands shook so badly they could barely handle the ammo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave you guys a chance. Now, it's my turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's figure flickered like a ghost, weaving through the group of gunmen in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What followed was a symphony of screams and thuds as bodies hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood pooled on the ground like crimson flowers blooming on concrete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few seconds, Tim's supposed ace in the hole</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>his elite gunmen</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>had been mowed down like dominoes, sprawled across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what should we do? Let's get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim ducked behind Gregory, and his face was ghost-white with fear. He was regretting every life choice that had led to this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here? And where exactly would we get to?" Gregory growled, and his eyes were locked on Alexander. Even though his back was covered in cold sweat and every instinct screamed at him to flee, he knew their only shot at survival was to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!" Gregory lunged forward like a tiger, and his saber flashed in the light as he aimed a vicious strike at Alexander's throat. The angle was perfect, and the execution was lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander just stood there with a smile, casually lifting two fingers to catch the blade between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch!" Gregory strained to pull his saber free, and his muscles burned with effort as sweat dripped down his face. But it wouldn't budge an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another one of Yinson's lab rats, huh?" Alexander sneered, "Just as useless as the others." With a casual flick of his wrist, he sent the saber spinning back. The blade sliced deep into Gregory's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Gregory's scream echoed as blood poured from the bone-deep gash across his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory stumbled backward, staring at Alexander in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So much for being a test subject. Pathetic," Alexander said with a dismissive smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you... so strong? What even are you?" Gregory's voice shook. "This is impossible. Even if you're some martial arts master or a high-level mutant, you shouldn't be able to take me down with one hit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory was freaking out, desperate to stay alive. If he knew Alexander had barely used any effort</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>that he'd been basically toying with him</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>he probably would have lost it completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen to me, Alexander." Gregory's voice took on a pleading edge. "Let me walk away, and Tim is all yours. I'll even be your inside man when I get back to Sakra Society. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim's jaw dropped at his friend's words. He stared at his supposed friend, wishing he could strangle him right there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pondered for a moment. "What about Elaine? Tell me what she's been up to lately, and maybe</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>just maybe</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>I'll let you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gregory froze, and his eyes went wide. "Wait... is Elaine your spy? I haven't seen her around lately. No idea where she went."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shrugged, looking almost apologetic. "Too bad. I gave you a chance, and you blew it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you manipulative bastard!" Gregory's chest tightened with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy thud, Tim dropped to his knees, bowing repeatedly before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry! I screwed up!" Tim begged through his tears. "Please let me make it right. I'll do anything, be your servant, whatever you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice cracked as he pleaded, racked with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a harsh laugh. "Seriously? At your age, are you still pulling this pathetic and childish act? The moment you betrayed me, you sealed your fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You too. On your knees." Alexander turned to Gregory, and his voice was deadly calm but dripped with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just that simple gesture, Gregory felt an overwhelming pressure crash down on him, like a mountain pressing against his chest. He could barely breathe.</span></p></div>
