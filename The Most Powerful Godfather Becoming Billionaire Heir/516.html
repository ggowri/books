        <h1>Chapter 516 Dead</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix and about a dozen of his men stepped off the plane, where dozens of people were already waiting on the tarmac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was an elderly man with a deeply wrinkled face and tired, yellowing eyes. Dressed in a tailcoat, he looked like a butler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his age and white hair, he stood tall, without the slightest hint of a stoop or hunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, in particular, lacked the dullness of old age; instead, they were sharp and alert, glinting with life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, the old man was a martial arts expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, the old man signaled the crowd behind him to part, and out stepped a middle-aged man, Barry Morris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's sharp gaze was fixed intensely on Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man followed him obediently, while a young woman in her twenties stood to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on Felix, watching him with scrutiny, caution, and even a hint of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For once, Felix didn't wear his usual stern expression; instead, he plastered on a broad smile and, with a straight-faced Danielle beside him, strode toward Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flicked over Barry, then settled on the old man and the young woman, making him tense up slightly as he murmured in a low voice, "Everyone, be on high alert. They're powerful, especially the old man. His strength runs deep, and I can't even gauge it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Felix's warning, his subordinates immediately curbed their arrogance and took on a more cautious demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They continued to stare at the old man, mentally sizing up his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was already a level-three metahuman with formidable martial skills. Could the old man possibly surpass him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly caught their attention was the young woman beside him, dressed in a sky-blue high-slit qipao, her alluring figure accentuated by long, slender legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Danielle's mature allure, this woman exuded refined elegance, like a polished gem glowing with allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two sides sized each other up, and in a few strides, Felix and his entourage were standing before Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's smile held a trace of obsequiousness, shedding the demeanor of a cold CEO and more like someone begging a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry raised a sharp brow and asked coldly, "Mr. Vanderbilt, was my son, Raven, really killed by Alexander? Did you fail to protect him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was loud, laced with anger and arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's brows furrowed. Barry was throwing down the gauntlet right from the start, and a flicker of hostility crossed his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly lowered his gaze, hiding his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Felix raised his head again, his smile had returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, I swear on my life, Raven was killed by Alexander! We've done all we could for revenge. Many lives have been lost on his behalf."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix put on a regretful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, even Raven's genetic backup had been extracted and used by Felix to enhance his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix extended his hand, but Barry ignored it, remaining cold and aloof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for formalities. This is my secretary, Joyce, and my butler, Diego Morris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family and ours share strong ties, and Red Umbrella Group has supplied a potent power elixir. Our patriarch wants me to join you in taking down Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son's death will be avenged!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry locked eyes with Felix, scrutinizing his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was overjoyed, about to express his gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Barry's tone shifted, and he spoke with haughty confidence. "Of course, there's a condition. You'll need to hand over half of your shares in Red Umbrella Group to the Morris family, free of charge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! You want half of my shares?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face turned tense immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been prepared to offer five percent, but with the Morris family demanding half, that would amount to a full twenty percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was he'd already gifted five percent to Francis; now, with the Morris family taking such a massive cut, it was as if they were bleeding him dry.</span></p></div>
