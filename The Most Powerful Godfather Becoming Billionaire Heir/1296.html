        <h1>Chapter 1296 A Mess</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie was young, but she was already the head of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Healiva Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She earned hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, and rumors said she came from a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she always acted like she was infatuated with Alexander, an ordinary intern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something felt off, but Alexander couldn't quite put his finger on what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you pass the exam and officially join the hospital, come to my department," Laurie said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Obstetrics and gynecology?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked reluctant. He had always felt that being a male doctor in that field was awkward...for both him and the patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, and here I thought you'd be honored! Not just anyone gets the chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie's voice was sweet and teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers traced small circles on Alexander's shoulder. A shiver ran down his spine, like an electric current jolting through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't acting like a department head. She was flirting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his self-control slipping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should go. Enough messing around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie laughed and dashed back into her car, her eyes glinting with mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Alexander disappeared from her rearview mirror, a white-haired old man dressed in black materialized in the back seat. He was as silent as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, he asked, "Ms. Garcia, is that boy really The Chosen One?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie's smile vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm wrong?" she said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man immediately lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Alexander is already in his twenties. He's just a nobody, an insignificant intern. He clearly hasn't received any Ultimate Legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He doesn't seem like he could ever become a Warrior. Honestly, I doubt he'll even make a great doctor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie cut him off before he could finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rudolf, who do you think you are? You're just a butler, and you dare lecture me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would never!" Rudolf said, "I only mean well, Ms. Garcia. Alexander doesn't deserve your attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolf bowed lower, his tone more respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie sneered. "Oh? You wouldn't dare? Seems to me you're getting bolder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the heir of the Garcia family, Mr. Garcia's cherished daughter, and the future of the entire family! I'd risk my life to stop you from making a mistake. That boy is trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolf was visibly agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You're just a servant. What right do you have to lecture me about the future of the Garcia family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My happiness is mine to decide. Even if he's a nobody, I can make him rise to greatness and shake the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolf had never seen Laurie so furious. He was terrified, but deep down, he still refused to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Garcia family had been lying low in Kylaville for over twenty years. They weren't as powerful as they once were, but their influence remained strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie only worked as a department head for fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Rudolf, she was far above Alexander, who wasn't worthy of even standing in her shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie kept insisting Alexander possessed the Ultimate Legacy, but Rudolf was convinced she was lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resentment boiled inside him. If he could, he would throw Alexander into the river and be done with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurie narrowed her eyes and spoke calmly. "I know you don't believe me. Let's make a bet. One day, Alexander will become someone you couldn't even dream of reaching."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolf scoffed. "Unless his family wins a billion dollars-dollar lottery one day and buys their way into the Garcia family, he'll always be trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided he would bypass Laurie and report this straight to her father, Esteban Garcia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Laurie muttered to herself, "Vincenzo is trying to eliminate Alexander to make room for his son, Drake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow's entrance exam... Let's call it Alexander's first trial. I want to see how he handles it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind was a complete mess. His thoughts bounced between Ava, the Ultimate Legacy, and a total blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still couldn't make sense of what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, he stopped overthinking and focused on meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The trace of the Force inside him surged and roared like a rising tide. Something inside his mind was loosening. Something was fighting to break free.</span></p></div>
