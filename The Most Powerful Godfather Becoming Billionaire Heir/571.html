        <h1>Chapter 571 Danger Ahead</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stormed out with Diego, slamming the door behind them. Felix quickly followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole sneered. This was the territory of The Kaylon; an inescapable trap was already set, and neither Felix nor Barry would escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been watching the scene unfold from the surveillance room. Observing Barry and Felix's reactions, he chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring Joyce in. I have some questions for her," he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Joyce was handcuffed and personally escorted by Cole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you planning?" Joyce asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce looked at them in confusion, then turned her gaze to Finley and Jaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley and Jaylon, the two who had "won," just smirked at her, shrugging and </span><span>spreading their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce understood immediately. This was a trap set by The Kaylon, specifically aimed at her and Barry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole threatened coldly, "Cooperate, and nothing will happen. But try anything funny, and I guarantee you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce shivered, feeling a chill, as she was escorted toward the room where Alexander awaited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you plan to do with her?" Nancy asked Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Felix and Barry teaming up can't mean anything good. As for Joyce's fate&mdash;that'll depend on how smart she is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she honestly spills Felix and Barry's plans, I might just let her live. I don't kill women unless I have to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of menace flashed in Alexander's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was only a slight hint, it was enough to make Nancy's heart tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, with only the faint sound of coffee brewing breaking the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Cole escorted Joyce into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat commandingly in the center of the sofa, with Nancy beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joyce entered, her full attention was drawn to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The man is simply..." Joyce stared, momentarily at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, he looked like a young, handsome guy. With a second look, she felt an intense, commanding presence that seemed untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were the most striking. It was like terrifying whirlpools capable of swallowing a person's very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce stopped in her tracks, feeling as if her very soul had left her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gazed at her indifferently, showing no trace of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they locked eyes, Alexander's All-seeing Eyes were already working to influence Joyce's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Joyce wasn't an ordinary person, it would be best to subtly break her will without her noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Wh</span><span>-Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce asked, dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled lightly, "Me? I'm the one Felix wants to take down, Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're Alexander?" Joyce's face paled in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked horrified, as if jolted awake from a nightmare, and took several steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that The Kaylon was already working with Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would explain why Finley and Jaylon had set up a trap, deliberately provoking Barry and then winning her as a "prize." It was all to find out Barry and Felix's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce wasn't a fool; in an instant, she had guessed the truth of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the casino was probably covered with inescapable traps, and leaving would be impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sad part was, Barry had no idea!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of sympathy for Barry hit Joyce hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "Lay out Felix and Barry's plan, in full detail. Since you're a woman, I might just spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce's face grew darker. Her suspicions had been right all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at her coldly. "Go on, speak up. You're still young; you don't want to die, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you are...?" Joyce asked, still dazed by Alexander's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce's mind was foggy from Alexander's mental influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy gave a sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me? I'm Nancy, The Kaylon's leader."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce froze in shock. The leader of The Kaylon herself was here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Nancy, leaning on Alexander like a lover, signified that he was The Kaylon leader's man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Barry was truly in danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought filled Joyce with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Joyce looking lost and dazed, Alexander's eyes flashed, and he barked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if thunder had suddenly cracked in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce clutched her head and collapsed to the ground, her mental defenses shattering instantly...</span></p></div>
