        <h1>Chapter 682 A Work of Art</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, brimming with exhilaration, felt an overwhelming surge of power coursing through her as though she could take down a tiger with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, have I truly become stronger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize asked in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded confidently. "You've become at least three times stronger than before, and with your enhanced potential, your strength will continue to grow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize threw herself into his arms, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, during those hardest days in the hospital, you were all I thought about. Only by thinking of you could I endure the pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touched, Alexander gently wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's kisses traveled along Alexander's face, her hands wandering downwards until her right hand rested on the front of his trousers. With a teasing smile, she asked, "Mr. Hawthorne, do you want me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her touch was skilled, and her eyes sparkled with mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's loyalty to Alexander came from three things&mdash;her gratitude, her admiration for his strength, and the unparalleled fulfillment he brought her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize had known many men before, but none had ever satisfied her due to her remarkable stamina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After every intimate moment, she felt as though she were left hanging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Alexander, it was different. She could barely withstand his intensity, often feeling overwhelmed with pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, this was as important as it was irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hands gripped her hips, squeezing firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're tempting me, so you deserve a spanking," he teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize giggled and happily turned, leaning over the sofa and lifting her full, rounded hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, spank me. It's my fault for teasing you. Punish me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlize, you're getting bolder by the day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, pulling down her fitted jeans to reveal a small black thong nestled between her curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't resist running his hands over her soft, full flesh, giving her a couple of firm slaps, making her skin bounce. The sight was enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize wiggled her hips, her voice rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Spank me harder, Mr. Hawthorne! I'm such a naughty girl; I deserve this! More... punish me, fill me, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander licked his lips, pressing against her, watching as her flushed, crimson vagina enveloped his penis. He exhaled deeply, pleasure flooding over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize moaned, already overwhelmed with satisfaction before he'd even fully begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander moved in earnest, Charlize arched her back, lifting her hips to meet him, eyes closed, brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! So deep..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her skin graft after the burn injuries, Charlize's skin had become softer and fairer. It was liked a work of art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enjoying the feeling of her in his arms, Alexander felt a powerful sense of conquest...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, a week had passed since Alexander had returned to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> from Mandalay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just those seven days, he had produced hundreds of protective amulets and used the magic circle to enhance the abilities of Charlize, Marvin, Betty, Rosalia, and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Ultimate Alliance was stronger than ever, poised for Alexander's command to set out for Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Augusta had reported that the Red Umbrella Group's Demon Summoning Array was nearly complete, thanks to their relentless construction efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around the array's perimeter, an array of construction machinery and countless workers continued to toil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the heart of the massive array, a reverse cross was anchored, leading to a deep elevator shaft that connected directly to the Red Umbrella Group's underground bunker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red Umbrella Group had also prepared numerous gemstones strategically embedded around the array to form a giant pentagram. This setup would allow the wielder to draw upon demonic power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden in the shadows, Augusta and William watched discreetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them kept their cameras on, pointing them at the Demon Summoning Array, livestreaming to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched from his phone as the scene unfolded. He knew the array would be fully operational within days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a white-haired elder in a black robe appeared, along with Felix, who had been missing for some time.</span></p></div>
