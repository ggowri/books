        <h1>Chapter 883 Getting Down to Business</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Keith was engrossed in filming, Alexander arrived in </span><span>Shiru</span><span> with Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shiru</span><span> was a famous bustling commercial area, packed with entertainment venues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also home to many skyscrapers, making it one of the most vibrant places in </span><span>Risun</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, can we have some fun over there?" Marvin asked, pointing ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed hard, his eyes filled with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked up and immediately spotted the </span><span>Kabukicho</span><span> sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Already thinking about women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood how men thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin scratched his head, looking a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. Shadow's already here and waiting for us. Business comes first," Alexander </span><span>said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander led Marvin toward </span><span>Shiru</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shiru</span><span> was undoubtedly the heart of </span><span>Risun's</span><span> nightlife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a paradise not just for men, but for women as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether a man sought a woman or a woman wanted an attentive host, as long as you had money, the options were endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the wealthy, </span><span>Kabukicho</span><span> was heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, the only limit was your imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Marvin made their way forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had Shadow come to </span><span>Risun</span><span> in secret, not just to deal with the Sakra Society but primarily to target the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia's branch in </span><span>Risun</span><span> was located nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The streets were lined with hostess bars, love hotels, and bustling crowds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Young women in revealing outfits, elegant older ladies, and sophisticated women of high status could all be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feminine men were also abundant&mdash;lacking masculine traits but likely popular male hosts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the air was thick with the scent of alcohol and indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin's eyes darted everywhere, overwhelmed by the photos of scantily-clad women and the open advertisements. He looked like he'd been hit with a shot of adrenaline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander hadn't said no, Marvin would have already run into one of the hostess bars to have fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kabukicho</span><span> was a hub for various factions, with dozens of groups staking out their territories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most powerful among them were the Dragon Gang, the Sakra Society, and the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wherever you went, women generated huge profits, and no one could afford to ignore that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way!" Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid being followed, Alexander quickly led Marvin into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the two slipped into an unremarkable alleyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the main streets lined with hostess and host clubs, this alley was filled with upscale clubs and bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the women soliciting customers here were more attractive than those outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, these were private, high-end clubs catering to a wealthier clientele.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped in front of one of the clubs, ready to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few large men approached and blocked Alexander's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, this is a members-only club. Are you one of our VIPs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander casually made the pre-arranged hand gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men froze, then immediately bowed in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome, Mr. Hawthorne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We didn't realize it was you. Please forgive us, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a slight smile and walked in with Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With someone leading the way, they encountered no further obstacles as they made their way deeper into the club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne!" Shadow greeted enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow hurried forward with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted his shoulder, and the three of them entered a small lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is everything ready?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow nodded respectfully. "Everything is ready, young master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He led Alexander further inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They passed through a long corridor, entered a bedroom, and then opened a hidden door in the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A secret staircase appeared, and the group descended into the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, Marvin's eyes widened with excitement at the sight before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The basement was at least 86 feet&mdash;a small-scale arsenal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls and display racks were lined with the latest automatic rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ammunition crates were stacked high, filled with neatly arranged bullets and grenades.</span></p></div>
