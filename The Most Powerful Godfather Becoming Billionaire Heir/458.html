        <h1>Chapter 458 Thrill</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his daughter still asleep, snuggling her favorite stuffed bear, Alexander let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he realize his whole body was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex, what's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava came rushing out, wrapping her arms around him with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a nightmare, that's all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath, pulling Ava close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all good, Ashley's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gently stroked his face, her warm body pressing against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strap of her nightgown had slipped at some point, and the soft curve of her chest was peeking out, barely restrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hand moved to Ava's chest, giving a gentle squeeze as he kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's cheeks flushed, and she pulled his head closer, her soft moans escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My beauty cream's working wonders, huh? Feels like they've gotten even bigger&mdash;so firm, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kneaded her gently, enjoying how her softness shifted and moved under his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... it tickles..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava whimpered, her body going limp against his, strength fading away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander started pulling her nightgown down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava snapped back to her senses, quickly grabbing his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not here! Let's go back to the room&mdash;Ashley might wake up and catch us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a playful grin, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, she's out cold. No way she's waking up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes drifted to the dim corner of the room, where he knew Rosalia Collins&mdash;his bodyguard&mdash;was hiding, having watched for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, babe, this makes it even more exciting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words sent a shiver through Ava, her hesitation fading as she wrapped her hands around his penis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You men are all the same. It'll turn you on, huh? If Ashley catches us, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava muttered, but she knelt down anyway, her hands moving over his penis and her lips pecking kisses on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ample breast swayed gently with her movements, like a pendulum back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, you know you're always my number one. We </span><span>gotta</span><span> get a little boy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her hair in his hand, guiding her, feeling the excitement rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the shadows, Rosalia watched, her breathing quickening, her body heating up, her underwear soaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ava's soft gasps filled the room, the atmosphere grew thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava knelt on the floor, her round hips lifted high, her hands over her mouth, trying not to make too much noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they woke Ashley, Ava would be mortified. She'd never live it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more anxious Ava was, the bolder Alexander became, moving faster and pushing </span><span>Ava to her limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander said, Ava felt the thrill of something forbidden for the very first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia watched from the shadows, her face flushed, her entire body trembling with an overwhelming urge to join them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander hadn't given her the signal, so she stayed put, biting her lip and fighting the urge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, oblivious to Rosalia, had her back to her, and Rosalia stayed in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tugged on Ava's soft curves, picking up his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's pale skin was flushed, her body trembling with soft whimpers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's face burned, her chest heaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but admire how powerful Alexander was&mdash;no woman could resist or even want to walk away from that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia imagined herself in Ava's place, and her legs turned to jelly, barely able to hold herself up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over an hour later, Ava was at her limit, and Alexander finally let her go, satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked at him, her face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I just can't keep up... it's all my fault..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, giving her a light pat on her backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did great. Go rest. Rebecca will take over now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's eyes went wide as she looked towards the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia, more than ready, walked out of the shadows, her hips swaying, looking at Alexander with anticipation.</span></p></div>
