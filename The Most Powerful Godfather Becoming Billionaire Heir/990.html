        <h1>Chapter 990 This Is a Crime</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher sneered arrogantly, "That coward Alexander didn't even dare to show up. What a useless loser!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he's too afraid to come, I'll still dig up this grave and make sure Alexander cries over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Start digging!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With an excited wave of his hand, Asher commanded his men to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a group of them raised their shovels, ready to dig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! You can't do this! The deceased have found peace. How can you desecrate their grave? This is an act that will send you to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lily cried out in desperation, nearly fainting on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher showed a sarcastic smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who let Alexander go against me? If Alexander wants me to stop, he better come here and bow in front of everyone to beg me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava spat on the ground in front of Asher, her eyes blazing with defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Enraged, Asher shouted, "Dig! Dig it up and feed the bones to the dogs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyone who dares stop us will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava glared at him, her eyes filled with an icy determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead and try. Let's see how you kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the men stepped forward, raising his shovel high, ready to strike the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man suddenly screamed and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bullet hole had pierced his forehead, and blood and brain matter splattered everywhere, resembling a smashed watermelon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sniper! There's a sniper! Take cover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher and Axel immediately ducked behind their bodyguards for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of their men scattered in panic. Some of them dove behind tombstones, others into bushes, and a few simply fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! How dare you resort to assassins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher roared in fury, drawing his pistol and pointing it at Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop! Who dares fire a shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud, commanding voice rang out as Oliver arrived, leading dozens of police officers to the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Oliver, Asher's face lit up with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Benton, you're just in time! Arrest these people immediately! They've set up a sniper to kill us. Look, here's the evidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pointed at the lifeless body on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver glanced coldly at Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "As the police commissioner of Loscity, I guarantee that this city will remain safe and secure. Anyone breaking the law will be held accountable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher nodded in agreement, satisfied. "Exactly, Mr. Benton! Whoever breaks the law should be arrested!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lily and Ava's group paled, thinking the police commissioner was siding with Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed like not only would the grave be desecrated, but they might also end up arrested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a commanding gesture, Oliver commanded, "Surround them!" Dozens of police officers rushed forward and surrounded Asher and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher froze in shock before erupting in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouted, "Oliver, what do you think you're doing? They hired the sniper to kill my men, and you're targeting us instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel, trembling with anger, pointed a finger at Oliver and scolded, "Oliver, do you know who I am? Are you trying to lose your job by offending the Vance family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver's expression tightened. As a member of the Vance family, Axel represented one of the empire's most powerful clans, a force Oliver couldn't afford to antagonize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But recalling Gavin's backing, Oliver summoned his courage. He thought, "Success often comes with risk, and this is a gamble I am willing to take."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver snorted coldly and said, "Mr. Axel Vance, Mr. Asher Vance, I don't yet know which side hired the sniper, and I don't have evidence to arrest anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But do you think being part of the Vance family gives you the right to desecrate graves and seize other people's burial sites?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are committing a crime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His righteous declaration stunned everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lily and Ann cheered with joy, realizing Oliver was on their side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Ava's expression turned complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she was the president of the Saint Group, even she couldn't influence the police commissioner. This was all thanks to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was about to lash out when Axel stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sinister grin, Axel pulled out a document and said, "Oliver, here's the contract for our acquisition of West Cemetery, along with the renovation permits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We are conducting legal renovations, and this grave must be removed. If you obstruct us, you're breaking the law, and your position as police commissioner will end here!"</span></p></div>
