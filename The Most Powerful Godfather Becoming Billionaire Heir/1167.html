        <h1>Chapter 1167 Stomach Pains</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston's right arm had already been broken by Alexander earlier, but it could have healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Tristan's blade had completely severed it. The limb dropped to the ground, fingers still twitching slightly. Blood gushed out like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between the pain and shock, Preston's eyes rolled back, and he passed out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in stunned silence as Tristan dropped the blade and fell to his knees before Alexander, pressing his forehead to the ground in a deep bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've failed to teach my son properly. Please punish me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozens of tough guys behind him dropped to their knees as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was wild</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>these same men who'd stormed in looking ready for a fight were now groveling on the ground. Everyone else in the room could barely process what they </span><span>were seeing, like their eyes were playing tricks on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes locked on Alexander. The crowd knew this guy had to be someone seriously powerful to make Tristan and the Ultimate Alliance crew back off like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The looks coming his way were a whole mix of emotions</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>confusion, curiosity, fear, and respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the unconscious Preston, then at Tristan, trembling on his knees, about to say something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ava grabbed his arm and whispered, "Let it go. The </span><span>guy's</span><span> already lost a hand. That's enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "Fine, we're out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked out of the bar hand in hand, with people scrambling to clear a path for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan stayed frozen on his knees, not daring to move a muscle. Only after Alexander and Ava were completely gone did he finally let out a massive sigh of relief and collapse onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Preston came to, whimpering. "Dad... I'm your son... Why did you... why did you cut off my hand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are they? Where's that bastard?" Preston yelled, totally clueless about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! If you want to live, then shut your damn mouth!" Tristan roared, looking like he wanted to strangle this worthless idiot right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand dismissively. "Take him to the hospital. Once he's patched up, I never want to see him in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two burly guys grabbed Preston from both sides and started dragging him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Dad, what are you doing? Dad, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please forgive me!" Preston screamed, his face turning ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the guys leaned in close to his ear with a nasty grin. "You know who that guy was just now? He's..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the guy's voice dropped to a whisper at the end, Preston felt like his brain had short-circuited. Everything went blank like he'd been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He... He's your boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston completely deflated, like all the fight had drained out of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd harassed the Ultimate Alliance leader's woman, and he'd gotten off with just a broken hand and his life intact. It was quite a dumb luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, back at home, Alexander was about to hop in the shower when Ava suddenly frowned, clutching her stomach as the color drained from her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Alexander rushed to support her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My stomach hurts," Ava said softly. "I think my period's coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly carried her to the bedroom, gently laying her down on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hurts so much every time," Ava said. "Isn't there some way to treat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately used Force Sense to scan her condition, his hands carefully pressing and examining her abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Alexander touched her, Ava's pale face flushed pink. She gazed up at </span><span>him with soft, glistening eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you really make it stop hurting?" She could hardly believe it. Sure, every woman dealt with period pain, but hers was particularly brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay still. I can actually help," Alexander said, keeping her in place as she tried to squirm away. He noticed her cheeks turning bright red as she watched him nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but laugh. "Relax. You're not feeling well right now. I'm not going to try anything. Just think of me as your doctor, and you're my patient, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew more serious. "This might seem minor, but it's taking a toll on your body. You've been working yourself too hard, and it's built up over time. You need to stop pushing yourself so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can help with the pain and get your body back to a healthy state."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Ava was amazed. She never would have guessed Alexander could treat something like this, too. It seemed almost magical.</span></p></div>
