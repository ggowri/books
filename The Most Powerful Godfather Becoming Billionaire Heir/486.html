        <h1>Chapter 486 Candlelight Dinner</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You promised me! No backing out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her serious expression, Alexander realized she was genuinely committed to this plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava then threw herself into his arms, seeking comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't leave you. I just can't bear to see my mom suffer. She has endured so much for me, and I didn't appreciate her until now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She gave me this precious Obsidian Core just like that, and I don't want her to be sad anymore or encounter any bad guys again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gazed at the ceiling, imagining how wonderful it would be if he could effortlessly bring joy to both mother and daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought thrilled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this: tomorrow night, we'll celebrate my mom's birthday. That's your best opportunity. Trust me, I'll help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava hugged Alexander tightly, pushing him back onto the bed as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next evening, Lynn sat at home, feeling a bit restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her birthday, yet she felt no excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had planned to spend the day with Victor, but thoughts of him dulled her mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava mentioned going out to meet an important friend, and Lynn felt a pang of disappointment, thinking her daughter had forgotten her birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, we haven't shopped together in ages. Let's go out!" Ava said cheerfully, linking arms with her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Lynn wasn't in the mood, she forced a smile. "Oh, I don't feel like it. Aren't you meeting that important friend tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's still early! Come on, just this once..." Ava insisted, playfully tugging at her mother's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright! I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn sighed, following her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, Alexander came down the stairs, looking sharp in a well-tailored suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned on the sound system, filling the villa with soft, pleasant music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laid a pristine white tablecloth over the dining table, set up candleholders, and lit the candles, dimming the lights for a cozy atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arranged vibrant roses in a vase and placed it on the table alongside gleaming wine glasses and polished silverware. The ambiance was becoming romantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to him, Ava had discreetly added magic powder to the wine, knowing it would excite desires, especially when mixed with alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With plenty of time, Alexander began preparing dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After years in the Fairfax family, he had honed his culinary skills, so crafting a lavish meal was a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Lynn spent two full hours shopping before dropping her mother off at the doorstep at home. Ava then made an excuse to leave, claiming she had to meet a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn sensed something odd about Ava today, but she couldn't pinpoint what it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she looked up at the starry sky, she felt a wave of emotions wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was fate really so cruel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing her beloved husband in a car accident had forced her into difficult situations with men, leading to misunderstandings with her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After years of hard work, she had achieved some success and earned a decent living, yet her romantic life remained unfulfilled and flawed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Victor appeared, charming her with sweet words, and they quickly began dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her shock, he turned out to be a deceitful con artist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had she done to deserve such misfortune? Why did all these hardships fall upon her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in Lynn's eyes. She managed to hold back her emotions in front of Ava, but when alone, she couldn't contain herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking Alexander was out with Ava, she opened the door, her eyes shimmering with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She staggered to the door and opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!" she exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm, orange glow filled the room, accompanied by the delicious aroma of food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dining table was adorned with steaming dishes, and just then, Alexander emerged from the kitchen.</span></p></div>
