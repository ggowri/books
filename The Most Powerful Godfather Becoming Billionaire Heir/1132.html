        <h1>Chapter 1132 Car Accident</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander placed </span><span>it </span><span>in front of Olivia and asked coldly, "What else do you have to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was speechless, trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier kicked Olivia to the floor, picked up the utility knife on the desk, and was about to kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grasped his hand and chuckled, "You still need to find gems for me, so you can't commit a murder. Don't worry. Leave it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then called Augusta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Augusta came with a few burly men, handcuffed Olivia and Tobias, and taped their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered, "Don't let Tobias die soon. Try to find out Yinson's whereabouts from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! </span><span>We got this</span><span>, boss," Augusta replied immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his hands excitedly. He had been idle of late and, at last, had something to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias and Olivia struggled desperately, but Augusta took them away, one in each hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier sighed and sat down on a chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, without your help, I would have been harmed by those two bastards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Yinson has restarted the Apocalypse Project. This time, many important figures are teaming up with him for immortality. There will be a catastrophe soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier, from today on, buy up all the top-grade gems on the market at all costs and send them to Treasure Island!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, boss," Xavier replied loudly. The mention of the purchase of the top-grade gems excited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Even if the world is in chaos, I can keep your family safe. You can go to Treasure Island, which is a paradise on earth," Alexander smiled, patting Xavier on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was thrilled, never expecting that Alexander had already made plans and prepared a shelter from doomsday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the southern outskirts of Loscity, hundreds of heavy trucks loaded with weapons, ammunition, food, and daily necessities headed for Louvian Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, huge convoys had been departing from warehouses in the suburbs of the Ultimate Alliance every day, working overtime to deliver goods to the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The supplies were loaded onto ships at the port, bound for Treasure Island in the south.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already dropped twenty billion on supplies, followed by shipments of manufacturing equipment, power generators, water purification systems, and more.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lot of money was spent in a short time, but he didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, the convoy was carrying a cargo of significant military equipment, which Alexander had acquired through the Lawson family, worth a billion dollars.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and William, along with thirty special forces members of the alliance, escorted them to ensure safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow and Logan assisted Cloe in the reclamation and construction of Treasure Island and Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of such a huge convoy, laden down with cargo, with a few lightly armored Land Rovers leading the way, was indeed very shocking and eye-catching.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, wherever the convoy went, it was the center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heavy wheels rolled over the concrete road and sped past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the whistling of the wind and the mighty roar of the engines, it was extremely cool.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The convoy headed south towards Louvian Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, it was late at night. The destination was a few hours' drive away.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and William both relaxed a lot, glanced at each other, and smiled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been on Treasure Island longer than they had been in Loscity and had developed an affection for the island. They were eager to get back because they were free on the island, which was their home base. Being in another place was indeed different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a Land Rover, which was leading the way, braked, spun out from sheer inertia, and hit a large tree on the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tree, as thick as a bowl, broke off directly. The hood of the car was deformed, with a plume of smoke rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Marvin exclaimed before ordering the convoy to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long convoy pulled over like a long serpent in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked around vigilantly and warned, "It's a very remote place surrounded by mountains and forests. Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin immediately ordered via the intercom, "Team One, move forward to investigate. Report any unusual situations at once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Land Rovers instantly broke away from the convoy, sped forward, and were soon lost to sight in the night.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin ordered his subordinates to rescue the wounded. Then, he and William walked around the car, carefully trying to find out what had caused the accident.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Oh</span><span>!" they exclaimed at the same time, staring at the two broken front wheels with wide eyes in astonishment.</span></p></div>
