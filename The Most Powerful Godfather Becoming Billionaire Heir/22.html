        <h1>Chapter 22 Scorn</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander burst into laughter to mask his embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, if fate were to claim me, would you find yourself missing my presence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taken aback by the suddenness of his query, Ava responded with a fervent rebuke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Silence! I shall not permit such a fate. You are forbidden from leaving this world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a deliberate furrowing of his brows, Alexander feigned a shiver and whispered, "A sudden chill runs through me. Am I dying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears, like crystal beads, began to trace their way down Ava's cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You shall not leave me," she declared. "So long as you remain by my side, I vow to be yours in marriage. Your every wish shall be my command."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stunned by her words, Alexander pinched himself to discern if this were reality or a dream spun from the threads of desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Truly?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava affirmed and nodded vigorously, and her cheeks flushed with a rosy hue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been handpicked by Godfather himself to accompany Alexander, who was, in every conceivable way, exceptional. But now, he lay wounded, a casualty of his own bravery in shielding her from harm. With his sacrifice fresh in her mind, she found there was no conceivable way she could turn her back on him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the tips of her toes, Ava reached, bestowing upon Alexander a gentle kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Alexander leaned in, his lips mere inches from hers, the shrill cry of sirens pierced the air. An ambulance, flanked by several police cars, screeched to a halt at the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava, whose cheeks were aflame, pushed him gently away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cease your playfulness. You are injured and must go to hospital at once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander, marked by a bullet's graze, bore only a crimson trail upon his skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's heart, which had been clenched with anxiety, finally settled into a serene calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander reached the hospital, his thigh wound was stitched thrice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't help but marvel at the twist of fate. With the Force on his side, he had narrowly escaped a gruesome fate; without it, he was certain a significant chunk of his flesh would have been the price paid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava had already summoned a cadre of bodyguards. They now stood like sentinels, filling the corridor with their imposing presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bearing a basket of fruit, she returned to the ward, peeling an apple with tender care and slicing it into morsels for Alexander to savor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander stretched out with an ease he had never known, basking in the novelty of such protective luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was relishing the sweetness of the apple when his phone's ring shattered the tranquility. Jane's name flashed across the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Initially, he had no desire to engage with the incoming call, but curiosity about the woman's words tugged at him irresistibly, compelling him to listen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He answered the call, greeted by Jane's gloating laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, word has reached me of your hospital stay. Was it Billy from the Wolf Gang who marked you? Heed my advice and lift the curse from my fianc&eacute;, or else..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish, Alexander, weary of her threats, ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled, "Your ex-wife believes your injuries are Billy's doing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression then turned solemn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I must apologize. The assassin's aim was surely for me, yet you were caught in the crossfire."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a gentle smile, Alexander chose not to correct her misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was willing to let her hold onto the belief that he was her knight, for in truth, he had donned that mantle. Had he not stepped in, the second bullet would have surely claimed her as its target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the solitude of the ward, his eyes found hers and held them in a silent, intense communion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was the very picture of loveliness, with arched brows that seemed painted by a celestial hand, a nose that rose proudly, lips that held the hue of ripe cherries, a figure both lush and alluring, and skin that was as smooth as silk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was the epitome of grace and strength, embodying the essence of a formidable female leader. But her domineering temperament also enhanced her charm with an edge of authority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A woman of such pristine beauty, wealth, and status was like a siren call to the male psyche, igniting in Alexander an overwhelming urge to conquer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the intensity of his stare, Ava felt a blush creep across her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Alexander leaned in, drawn by an irresistible desire to pull her into an embrace, the door to the ward swung open abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma stepped in, her eyes widening at the sight of the intimate scene unfolding before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift roll of her eyes towards Alexander, Ava turned to address Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What is it?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma approached, her voice lowered to a whisper as she conveyed her message to Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Understood, I will attend to it immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava nodded and turned to Alexander. "Take care of your injuries. I must attend to this." With that, she left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma followed her out but returned after a short while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, do you truly believe yourself worthy of our esteemed Ms. Blackburn? I advise you to leave of your own accord and cease troubling her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander indifferently met her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What manner of man do you deem fit for her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are but a relic of society's underbelly, harboring fantasies of ingratiating yourself with Ms. Blackburn and dreaming of a life of ease won through her favor, are you not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's response was laced with scorn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A flicker of anger danced in Alexander's clear eyes, a testament to the storm brewing within. He thought, "This woman, much like Jane, sought to sow discord and undermine me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Ava's sake, he struggled to maintain his composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Atwood, you are merely Ms. Blackburn's secretary. You overstep your bounds in interfering in our affairs. Who I am, and what I am worth, is not for the likes of you to judge."</p></div>
