        <h1>Chapter 318 Jealousy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment and said, "No worries. I'll help you create the illusion that you escaped. Once you return, just say you seduced me and found a chance to flee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm one of the highest-ranking Shadow Warriors in the Red Umbrella Group, so they won't reject me if I go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, right. I need to take care of this body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia started dragging the body of the muscular man away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved her off and effortlessly threw the body into the yard, where he cast a blast of the Force at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>White flames sprang up immediately, engulfing the body, and burning intensely in the pouring rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the body turned to ash before their eyes, washed away by the rain until not a trace remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this... Hellfire? It can burn even in water and incinerated him so quickly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was utterly shocked, her eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a terrifying fire that was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a high-temperature crematorium would take hours to reduce a body to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mystery and power shook her to the core once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, several military-plated SUVs pulled up in front of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thompson's men are here. You be good and wait for me to come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Ava on her rounded hip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava held onto him tightly, forcing a smile as she said, "Please, stay safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the tears welling up in her eyes, Alexander felt bad. He quickly hugged her and gave her a gentle kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll come back safe and sound. I'm counting on you to look after Ashley and Lily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a tender moment together, Ava saw Alexander off to the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize and Augusta stood behind them, their emotions complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, Schroder, consumed by grief, committed suicide in the hospital, leaving a letter accusing Alexander of being the killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that Schroder was a lieutenant general in the Northern Command, Alexander would be in serious trouble if he couldn't cure Quentin's grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava watched Alexander's car drive away, feeling lost and vulnerable in a way she never did as the usually decisive and efficient CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Charlize asked, "Ms. Blackburn, if one day he were to leave you, would you be able to take care of yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ava snapped. "Charlize, do you know what you're saying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think just because you slept with him, you can be his woman. Men as exceptional as him have many women around, but I'm the only one he truly loves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize turned red, unable to find words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Ava to be so perceptive about her relationship with Alexander and handle it so gracefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, overestimating yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the stance of a victor, Ava held her head high and walked back into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize rolled her eyes and muttered, "What's there to be smug about? If I'd met him first, he'd love me more..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta snapped at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter, Captain? You scared me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize clutched her chest in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a stern expression, Augusta warned her, "Charlize, I don't mind you being with him, but if you show disrespect to Ms. Blackburn or jeopardize her safety, you'll face consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize went pale, realizing she'd crossed a line this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin hurried over to Charlize with a sly grin, saying, "Charlize, maybe you should just be with me. I'll promise to love only you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! Aren't you the one who goes to the bar every night, hitting on strippers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize shot him a scathing look, then solemnly assured Augusta, "Don't worry, Captain. I have my own principles and would never let personal desires endanger Ms. Blackburn's safety. If it came down to it, I'd die before she does."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's expression softened, and he gave Charlize a firm pat on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Alexander suddenly spotted a familiar figure standing by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Madelyn became his personal attorney, they'd often spoken on the phone but rarely met in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver looked questioningly at the crew-cut man in the passenger seat.</span></p></div>
