        <h1>Chapter 397 Call for Reinforcements</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked Lawrence far across the room, channeling the Force into him, executing another Force Annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could now kill someone silently; even if he used Force Annihilation in front of everyone, there would be no proof linking him to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence, who had just been so arrogant, was now brutally beaten and didn't dare say a word. He got up and ran for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he got outside, he stumbled and fell, convulsing on the ground and coughing up blood, looking close to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew Alexander was responsible for Lawrence's condition, but his method was so covert there was no evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia men, seeing Lawrence barely alive, dropped their act and fled like rabbits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's the Blood Gang's turn! Eugene, as the young master, you set a trap to harm your own. Tell me. How should I punish you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Eugene coldly, his eyes flashing with a hint of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary would have been in serious trouble if Alexander hadn't shown up today. This gathering was Eugene's setup, and he and Lawrence had planned the trap together. He couldn't escape blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was Alexander's woman, and anyone who dared touch her was courting death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Gang members looked grim. Not only had this guy killed Lawrence, but now he wanted to discipline their young master too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was outrageously arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene had expected to force Mary to serve him on her knees. Instead, Lawrence lay dying in front of him, and now Alexander was targeting him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jumped up, slamming the table and shouting, "Alexander, you think I'm easily scared?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because you can fight doesn't mean you're invincible. My dad, Wyatt, got to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> yesterday. Do you have a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face was full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll be waiting. Call your dad over. Let him come here and die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire room was in an uproar at Alexander's audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt Griffin, the head of the Blood Gang, was one of their most formidable assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a decade ago, Wyatt had claimed a heavyweight championship and was undefeated in the underground fighting rings. It's a renowned powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Wyatt's reputation, the Blood Gang had grown to become a top-tier gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having his father's protection was one reason Eugene acted so fearlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene never imagined Alexander would be brave enough to demand he call his father over. It was practically suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him, calmly taking a seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid Alexander might change his mind, Eugene rushed outside to make the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew what Eugene said on the call. When he returned, his demeanor was completely different, his gaze sharp and confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary felt a whirlwind of emotions, regretting deeply that she had gotten Alexander into such trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already offended the Mafia, and now he was going to take on Wyatt, too. Was he really about to shake all of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary leaned in close and whispered cautiously to Alexander, "Maybe we should just leave. Wyatt is dangerous. Let's go now, as fast as we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quietly slipped a gun to Alexander under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a good driver. Let's pretend to go to the restroom, then take off in the car as </span><span>quickly as we can. It'll be too late once Wyatt arrives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander only smiled, not taking the gun from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Spacing out? If we don't go now, we won't make it!" Mary urged, getting more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was on edge, getting increasingly desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the sound of footsteps echoed from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a powerful, authoritative voice called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's that kid, Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt had truly arrived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang, the door was kicked open, and a group of men in black stormed in, neatly lining up in two rows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these men was strong and burly, with cold, murderous looks in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a middle-aged man with a lean face and muscular build strode into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his hair was slightly graying, he radiated rage and an intense aura of hostility.</span></p></div>
