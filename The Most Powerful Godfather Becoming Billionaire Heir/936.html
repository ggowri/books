        <h1>Chapter 936 Tipsy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander emerged from the bathtub, cradling Yvonne in his arms. He gently laid her down on the floor, his hands roaming over her curves as he began to massage her buttocks. With his other hand, he reached new heights, sending shivers down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's body trembled under the dual assault, her strength waning as she lay helpless on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing her approaching climax, Alexander accelerated his pace and force, driving Yvonne to the brink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mature, fiery body swayed back and forth, her breasts and buttocks undulating in rhythm. The sound of her ecstatic cries was like a potent catalyst, propelling Alexander forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Alexander felt the tight, warm depths of Yvonne's body begin to convulse and contract, gripping him tightly once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne had reached the pinnacle of pleasure, but Alexander showed no signs of slowing down. Instead, he became even more ferocious, denying her any respite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two consecutive explosions, Yvonne lay limp on the floor, her breathing ragged. Alexander's hands roamed over her body, preparing to slowly withdraw, but Yvonne clung to him, her voice husky with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stop, just keep going. I love this feeling of fullness, it's so wonderful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't respond, but the intense satisfaction he felt made everything seem perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, he patted Yvonne's voluptuous buttocks, and she gazed up at him, her eyes sparkling with understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne positioned herself on her hands and knees, her buttocks raised high, the cleft between them tantalizingly exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was a true marvel, rivaling that of a supermodel, and the high heels she wore only added to her allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two orbs of her buttocks pressed against Alexander's legs, straining to rise even higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she knelt before him, her hips swayed seductively, her movements a tantalizing </span><span>invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deep breath, Alexander admired the almost flawless landscape before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne began to sway her hips, her buttocks undulating in a slow, seductive dance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, please continue. I want more... don't hold back. You can be rougher, I won't mind. I love it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't expected Yvonne to recover so quickly, but it seemed her dual identity as a witch and metahuman granted her extraordinary resilience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately grasped her firm, supple curves, entering her slightly but pausing without further movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne let out a satisfied moan of excitement, her rounded hips slowly pressing back, guiding him deeper with each inch, until he was fully inside her, enveloped by warmth and wetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gripped her firm hips with both hands, his gaze fixed on the delicate thong that stretched tightly against one side of her rounded backside. His mind consumed by a burning </span><span>desire,</span><span> he was driven by an overwhelming urge to claim her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gripped her firm hips with both hands, his gaze fixed on the delicate thong that stretched tightly against one side of her rounded backside. His mind consumed by a burning </span><span>desire,</span><span> he was driven by an overwhelming urge to claim her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne winced as Alexander's hands gripped her roughly, the pain mixing with the intense pleasure of his powerful thrusts. Her cries were a mix of anguish and ecstasy, torn between the two sensations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped her ass hard, each strike punctuated by degrading words. "You're nothing but a slut," he muttered, his voice dripping with contempt as he insulted her with crude, hurtful remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's expression was one of both satisfaction and agony, her body kneeling and arched with her hips raised, not sure how many times she had reached the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt himself surrounded by the irresistible heat of Yvonne's body, her curves tightening around him, holding him captive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he reached his breaking point, his release deep within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Alexander's hands gripped Yvonne's firm hips, his fingers sinking deeply into her flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body tensed, every muscle coiled as a wave of pleasure surged through him, a sensation so intense it felt like his soul was lifted to the clouds with each powerful, shuddering release deep inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne had fallen asleep, exhausted, while Alexander felt wide awake, energized and full of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After changing into his clothes, he made his way to the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, he found Timothy and the crew laughing and toasting, the clinking of glasses and their cheerful voices echoing in the night air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander joined them for a few drinks. He didn't get drunk, but the warmth of the alcohol left him pleasantly buzzed. He stretched out in a beach chair, the cool night breeze brushing over him as he closed his eyes and relaxed.</span></p></div>
