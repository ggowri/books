        <h1>Chapter 100 The Magic of Money</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shadow spoke quietly, "Boss, I don't think Mr. Augustine or Mr. Anthony stand a chance against Mr. Hawthorne. They're gonna fall sooner or later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh? You're that sure?" The old man with silver hair looked surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shadow nodded confidently. "That magic powder everyone's talking about? It's probably Mr. Hawthorne's work. Plus, he's about to team up with the Cripples, Blood Gang, Kaylon, and the big four families in Loscity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once they join forces, Mr. Augustine's Brilliant Group won't be able to make money from drugs anymore. They're pretty much done for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old man's eyes lit up, and a smile spread across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect that... Very well. Once he's dealt with Augustine, let him know that Anthony is behind the poisoning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anthony, that ungrateful wretch, doesn't regard me at all..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Understood, Godfather!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shadow then vanished silently into the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, there was more Shadow had not spoken. Despite his observations, he couldn't quite gauge Alexander's true strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wondered, "What kind of man is Mr. Hawthorne really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shadow was wearing a black mask, his eyes filled with curiosity and anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Alexander was busy perfecting the magic powder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the exchange conference just two days away, he needed to ensure he had ample supply to tempt the magic powders and the Saint Group into a genuine alliance, creating a community of interests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simultaneously, Alexander's continuous meditation had brought about noticeable progress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whereas he could previously use no more than one percent of the Force James had given him, he now wielded around ten percent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt his strength had multiplied several times over, though he hadn't yet verified it. His excitement was palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, progress on collecting materials for the Lightsaber had stalled. Anne had sent more meteorites, but the metal content was insufficient, and the perfect yellow gemstones remained elusive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, Alexander was confident that persistence would eventually lead to success.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On a brighter note, since Betty took over the magic powder operations, his bank balance had been steadily increasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear that Billy's embezzlement had been substantial, a hefty portion of the funds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This bastard really deserves it!" Alexander cursed Billy while accessing his bank account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching the balance approach 100 million dollars filled him with exhilaration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though the Saint Group was worth hundreds of billions of dollars, the personal accumulation of wealth carried a different weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As another payment arrived, pushing his balance past the 100 million dollars mark, his joy was uncontainable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though magic powder had only been on the market for a short time, its sales had been explosive. With pre-orders from various families and corporations, the revenue had surged beyond 100 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And that was just earnings in Loscity; the potential global profits were staggering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Alexander received a text from his bank: [Dear Mr. Hawthorne, your account balance has exceeded 100 million dollars. You've been automatically upgraded to Diamond VIP status, with a range of exclusive services...]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moments later, a female customer service representative called, informing Alexander of his new status and offering a range of special services.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tone was flirtatious, subtly suggesting a possible date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Alexander declined the customer service representative's flirtatious offer, his emotions were tangled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the sort of treatment that came with wealth. With enough money, it seemed even a bank president might bow and scrape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander decided to withdraw some cash from the bank to donate to a retirement home, with the request that James' room be preserved untouched, not to be assigned to anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">James had been both a mentor and a friend to him, and in the end, James had been like a father, passing on all his knowledge of the Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Arriving at City Bank, Alexander approached the lobby manager and said, "Hello, I have an appointment to withdraw 100 thousand dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The manager turned to face him, and their eyes met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The smiles that had been on their faces vanished instantly.</p></div>
