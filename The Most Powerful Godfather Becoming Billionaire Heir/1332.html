        <h1>Chapter 1332 Watch Your Step</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's jaw dropped. Instead of the stone cottage he'd expected, he found himself standing before a private residence with a grand courtyard. The main entrance featured an impressive oak door, and pushing it open revealed a U-shaped layout with buildings on three sides surrounding a central courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A servant in a brown livery emerged from the west wing and approached Alexander with a respectful bow. "Are you Mr. Hawthorne, sir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander blinked in confusion. Yeah, I'm Alexander. Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it really is you!" The servant's face lit up. "I'm Clyde. The Management Center assigned me to handle your meals and daily needs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?" Alexander felt like his head was spinning. After getting the full explanation, everything clicked into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His status had completely changed. Regular lay disciples didn't get private residences with personal servants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of treatment was reserved for those who carried the silver token, and out of the hundred thousand disciples in the Dominion Church's Outer Court, only a few hundred had earned one. Others had to either be a level-four warrior or an absolute prodigy to qualify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Church wanted these elite disciples to focus entirely on their training, without wasting precious time on mundane matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander was secretly thrilled, he played it cool. "Perfect timing. I'm starving. Could you grab me something to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right away, Mr. Hawthorne." Clyde hurried off toward the dining hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a quick tour of the house. The west wing was Clyde's quarters, while the east wing contained his own bedroom. Checking out his room, he found it fully furnished with everything he needed&mdash;a desk, chairs, bed, wardrobe, and all his clothes neatly arranged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main hall faced south, with an antique wooden dining table and chairs perfectly arranged in the center. Elegant wall sconces cast a warm glow throughout the space. The whole setup was spotless and totally comfortable. Satisfied, Alexander settled into one of the chairs and helped himself to some tea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clyde came back with a takeout box and started laying out the food. "Sorry if I got this wrong. I wasn't sure what you like, Mr. Hawthorne," he said as he unpacked everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No worries!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander consciously straightened his posture. Now that he had staff working for him, he needed to act the part. That was just how it worked&mdash;when people move up in the world, they naturally develop that boss energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you'll need to head to the training grounds tomorrow to start your combat practice. I'll leave you to your meal," Clyde said with a quick bow before heading out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about tomorrow, Alexander felt his stomach tighten at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander bolted upright at the sound of the bell. He jumped out of his bed like, threw on his gray training uniform, grabbed his steel staff, and made a beeline for the training grounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a veteran of countless Olympic events, Alexander had never seen anything quite like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The training arena was massive. He estimated it was about twice the size of the biggest stadium. The place was absolutely packed, with people everywhere he looked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was incredibly diverse&mdash;some folks looked like they'd walked straight out of a fantasy convention, complete with ceremonial swords at their hips, while others wore what seemed like modernized martial arts gear, carrying various weapons. They also had these absolute units with muscles on muscles, and then these incredibly agile smaller people practically defying gravity with their movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the far end stood an impressive command platform, like something out of an epic movie set. A massive flagpole flew a banner with an ancient symbol for "fight", while multi-story viewing pavilions stretched out on either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole place was decked out like the ultimate training facility. Every few dozen yards, there were these huge weapons racks loaded with literally every type of cold weapon, plus archery stations with bright red targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground was paved with these sleek stone slabs, but what caught Alexander's eye were the countless impact craters scattered across the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander studied these craters with growing excitement. He revognized the implications&mdash;only fighters with superhuman strength could leave marks like that. His heart started racing at the possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He joined the crowd gathering below the command platform, where Declan and Huxley stood with an honor guard of warriors. These guys weren't messing around&mdash;each one held a fighting staff with perfect discipline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan casually fanned himself with this massive fan when he started speaking. His voice wasn't particularly loud, but somehow it cut through everything else like crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This year's Outer Court recruitment has brought in over ten thousand new disciples," Declan announced. "You'll need to dedicate yourselves completely to your training... Weekly lectures will be held in the main hall... And don't forget the annual tournament... The rest is up to you. Make it count!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his speech, Declan turned and walked away with Huxley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd dispersed, Alexander was about to find a quiet spot to practice his advanced combat techniques. He'd been eager to work on his Spirit Step Evolution and master the Dragonhell Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it right there, punk!" A voice rang out. "This really saves me the trouble of hunting you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spun around to see a group of guys flanking a young man who was glaring daggers at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy was wearing an expensive training outfit, and Alexander immediately recognized that pale face, those beady eyes, and that flat nose&mdash;it was Julius, the rich playboy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turned out Julius hadn't taken his earlier humiliation well. Madden ordered Finn to send out search parties for Alexander and Logan. But since the two were staying at the Emerald Manor in Dominion Church, Julius's men had come up empty-handed.</span></p></div>
