        <h1>Chapter 266 Shameless</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick also shouted loudly, "Yeah! You said you'd be grateful to my mom, but you got me fired. Now you won't even cover some living expenses, you lowlife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple had become quite brazen, feeling emboldened by Lily's trust over the past </span><span>few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was getting anxious, feeling torn between them, and quickly tried to mediate, "Both of you, be quiet! Alexander, don't be mad. I won't take your money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was boiling with rage, yet his voice was eerily calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nick, you can stay here with Aunt. I'll give you $20,000 a month, but you must take good care of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you try anything funny, you'll regret it for the rest of your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick and Mia were overjoyed. They never expected Alexander to actually agree to give them money. It's $20,000 a month, at that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Alexander's eyes, that amount of money was worth less than a blade of grass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't bother saying anything else. He helped Lily into her wheelchair and pushed it himself as they left the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick and Mia quickly followed, afraid that their cash cow, Alexander, would get away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, they all arrived at the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a nice part of Ballad, not the most elite area, but definitely full of luxury homes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Nick and Mia entered the villa, they exclaimed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house was upscale and elegant. It's way beyond anything they had ever experienced. They practically wanted to claim it as their own on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty presented the paperwork for the villa's title transfer, respectfully saying, "Boss, once you sign this, you can get the property title."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Nick and Mia rushed over, exclaiming eagerly, "Why does he need to sign? Isn't this villa supposed to be for my mom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple had a well-calculated plan. Once the villa was in Lily's name, they could legally inherit it and eventually swindle it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave them a contemptuous look, having already seen through their petty schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can live here as long as you want. I won't charge you rent. Since I bought this villa, shouldn't I be the one to sign?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick slammed his hand on the table. "No way! My mom got her leg broken because of you. This should be your compensation to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia also shouted indignantly, "Alexander, you're saying nice things now, but who knows if you'll change your mind later? What if you kick us out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily quickly intervened, "Stop talking nonsense! Alexander won't kick us out. This is his house, and we shouldn't take it, nor should we take his money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick quickly grabbed her and complained, "Mom, don't be so naive. You sacrificed so much for Alexander, and now I've lost my job. We can't end up on the streets, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia snatched the paperwork from the coffee table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, we're family. You're rich now, so don't be so stingy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give us the villa. We're going to inherit everything anyway, so you might as well put it in our names now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was furious and wanted to confront them, but Alexander stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. "Are you sure you want it in your names?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick thought Alexander was giving in and immediately beamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, whether the villa is for my mom or us, it's the same since I'm her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you're getting old and forgetful. Just put it in my name, and I promise to take good care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia said, "Yes, we'll take good care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple shamelessly tried to coax Lily, truly lacking any sense of shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's mocking expression, Nick snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you looking at me like that? My mom was so good to you. She secretly gave you money. Without her help, you wouldn't have had the resources or energy to develop the potion while struggling at the Fairfax Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you're rich, and we haven't even asked for a share of the potion profits. You can't even spare one villa? That's too much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it! Just stop it! I don't want the villa, nor do I want Alexander's money..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's face turned red with embarrassment, ashamed of having such a son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander reassured her, "Aunt, don't worry. You've helped me so much in the past, and now it's my turn to repay you."</span></p></div>
