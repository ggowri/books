        <h1>Chapter 225 No Constraints</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob waved the machete menacingly at Alexander, hoping to intimidate him into paying up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, newcomers were easy targets, and sometimes, if you were lucky, you could make tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some had even scored millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob didn't expect to meet someone like Alexander, who seemed unfazed by the threat of death. "You won't pay? Fine, I'll take a hand as payment," Bob threatened, deciding to teach Alexander a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Bob swung the machete at Alexander's right hand. But Alexander moved like a ghost, dodging to the side and grabbing Bob's throat with the precision of an eagle snatching its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go..." Bob gasped, struggling desperately as his body convulsed from lack of oxygen. The machete clattered to the ground as he clawed at Alexander's fingers, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob's consciousness started to fade as he muttered pleas for mercy. Alexander, seeing the vicious criminal for what he was, felt no pity. He activated the Force, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a commanding voice, Alexander declared, "I am your master now. You will obey me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Alexander used Force Control without hesitation since his powers had grown. It was a risky move; if successful, he could deeply hypnotize Bob, turning him into a loyal servant. But if it failed, Bob could end up with severe brain damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of Alexander's Force Control, Bob's perception twisted. To him, Alexander seemed like an all-powerful emperor, someone he had to obey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master..." Bob croaked, eyes filled with awe and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was pleased. It seemed his abilities had indeed improved. Even though Bob's mental willpower wasn't as formidable as someone like William, it was stronger than that of ordinary people. Yet, Alexander had subdued him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob, why did you come to Treasure Island?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob replied in a daze, "I robbed over a dozen times, killed and injured people, and stole more than three million dollars. I was wanted, so I fled here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed. Bob was indeed a lowlife who deserved punishment. "Transfer all your money to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without resistance, Bob began transferring the funds as instructed. "Your bank account has received 3.6 million dollars..." a message confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the transfer was complete, Alexander struck Bob on the forehead and commanded, "Now, go jump into the sea and feed the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a trance, Bob walked toward the cliff, where the ocean churned below. The onlookers were stunned. They had watched Alexander speak a few words to Bob, who then leapt off the cliff like a madman, swallowed by the waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gasped, quickly abandoning any thoughts of exploiting Alexander and keeping their distance, wary of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy must be a dark wizard like Guzman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob was cursed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They whispered among themselves, fearful as they watched </span><span>Alexander walk</span><span> away. Bob's disappearance was barely noticed; such incidents were common on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but smile. Though three million dollars wasn't much, and Bob was gone, he felt satisfied. The lack of constraints and the freedom to act as he pleased suited him well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could make Treasure Island my base, that would be interesting," Alexander mused. The idea of defeating Guzman and claiming the island intrigued him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued on, Alexander drew closer to the heart of the island.</span></p></div>
