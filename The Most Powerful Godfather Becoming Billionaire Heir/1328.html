        <h1>Chapter 1328 Two Worlds</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Logan's shoulder with a grin. "Yeah, barely made it though. Got lucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan stepped forward and gave Alexander a formal bow. "Congratulations, my friend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Come on, Mr. Nathan Cavill, you're making me blush here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen threw his arms around Alexander. "Alexander, we've got drinks ready! Let's celebrate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys are too much. Thanks, everyone." Alexander gave them all a respectful bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole crew headed inside Emerald Manor...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night flew by in a blur of toasts and fantastic food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the party wound down, it was well past midnight, and everyone had headed home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hauled a very drunk Logan onto the bed, while Logan kept drunkenly insisting, "C'mon! Let's drink... I'm not even drunk... You gonna join me or what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier at the party, Alexander had finally worked things out with Nathan. Logan would take over as the manager of Emerald Manor. That was one less thing for him to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Logan joining the Outer Court of the Dominion Church, that was still five years down the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, with Spiritual Awakening and Muscle-Tendon Classic, passing the Outer Court trials for Logan in five years seemed like a sure bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was the thought of being separated from his only friend, even temporarily, but Alexander felt a heaviness settling in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed open the stone doors and stepped outside the manor grounds, taking a solo walk through the fields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the dead of night, and everything was perfectly still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The full moon hung bright and clear in the sky, its soft silver light spilling over everything&mdash;the Emerald Manor, the fields, the forest, the creek... It was like someone had draped the whole world in shimmering silver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gazed up at the moon, a wave of loneliness washing over him. He'd been in this strange world for months now, and the weight of it all was really starting to get to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he'd had to register as a farmer just to survive. Then he'd thrown himself into martial arts training to keep from getting stabbed in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The names and titles kept swirling in Alexander's head&mdash;Warrior, Ava, and an apocalyptic crisis. Was that world actually real?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or was this his true reality?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head, unable to make sense of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Declan's guidance had been a game-changer. He now understood the path&mdash;a level-five warrior could enter the Divine Transformation State, master the Ethereal Mind, and ultimately achieve the rank of Grand Archon. That was the key to breaking free from life's sufferings and finding true liberation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man, one conversation with a master really is worth more than anything," he muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Alexander didn't care which world was real&mdash;he refused to give up either way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd trade my whole life just to learn the truth of the world," he thought. "But wherever I end up, I'm going to leave my mark on history."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyebrows furrowed as his gaze turned sharp as steel. With iron determination, he declared, "I'll send all the demons back to hell and evolve beyond death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful roar burst from Alexander's throat, echoing endlessly into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander headed to the Outer Court without waking Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after he left, Logan stirred awake, clutching his head. "Ugh, my head is killing me! Alexander? Where'd you go? I still have something awesome to show you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan reached for the small golden medallion hanging around his neck. The front displayed an ornate palace bathed in golden light, surrounded by swirling clouds and crimson mist. On the back, a single word "Interception" was etched in bold, striking strokes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dominion Church's Outer Court was massive, featuring everything from the Martial Virtue Hall to training grounds, dining halls, and living quarters for over a hundred thousand lay disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander headed back to the Outer Court, dead set on checking out the Manual House and Treasure House first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both buildings sat within the church's inner sanctum&mdash;sacred ground where even lay disciples couldn't hang around for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Teleportation Plate in the Outer Court, Alexander materialized right outside the Manual House. The sight before him was pretty impressive&mdash;two magnificent halls standing side by side, their huge doors thrown wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?" Alexander thought, frowning. "This is supposed to be high-security. Why isn't anyone guarding it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puzzled, he stepped into the Manual House only to find it completely empty&mdash;not a single thing in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive hall was so bare it made him wonder if he'd somehow gotten the wrong place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me your badge!" A kid's voice suddenly piped up out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly fished out his silver waist token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beam of white light shot from the token, streaking toward what looked like thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, something wild happened&mdash;the empty space started rippling like water, and boom&mdash;a doorway materialized out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the doorway was a kid in blue robes, looking about eight or nine years old, flashing Alexander a friendly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander bowed respectfully to the kid. "Excuse me, is this the Manual House? I'm Alexander, a new lay disciple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kid's expression remained gentle and welcoming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, this is the Manual House. Come on in. I've heard about you&mdash;the Head Priest Hezekiah performed your Spiritual Awakening, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stepped through the doorway. The moment he crossed the threshold, the entrance vanished behind him, and he found himself standing in an enormous hall.</span></p></div>
