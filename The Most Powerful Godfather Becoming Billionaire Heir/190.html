        <h1>Chapter 190 Submission</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being</span><span> Alexander's subordinates, the members of the Fraternity </span><span>extremely happy at the benefits</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>looked at</span><span> Ian with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His</span><span> respect was </span><span>genuine</span><span>, and it was clear that once Alexander fully absorbed the Fraternity into his </span><span>force</span><span>, the Ultimate Alliance would stand toe-to-toe with any gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian, tomorrow you're going to the hospital to apologize to Logan. Bring 10 million dollars as compensation. And I don't want </span><span>anything happened today</span><span> leaking out. Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's icy gaze shot toward Lillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After delivering his orders, Alexander whisper</span><span>ed</span><span> a few more words in Ian's ear. Then he strode out of the room with Augusta and Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fraternity members instinctively recoiled as if faced with a predator, their eyes glued to Alexander and his entourage as they </span><span>left</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wondered</span><span>. "What is going on? Ha</span><span>s</span><span>n't our boss just submitted? Did Alexander really just walk away without taking control?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian exclaimed, support</span><span>ing him to get up</span><span>, "Ian, you played it brilliantly!</span><span> That idiot just left because of your act.</span><span> </span><span>Now </span><span>gather everyone, arms in hand, and we can wipe </span><span>them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian shot her a cold glare, a wicked smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get this foolish woman out of my sight! I want her to </span><span>work </span><span>as a slave </span><span>in </span><span>Soutaxia</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> telecom fraud&mdash;do whatever it takes to make sure she never shows </span><span>up</span><span> in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian! What are you doing? Please, I didn't do anything wrong! I'm begging you!" Lillian cried, her voice cracking as tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soutaxia</span><span> was known for its ruthless </span><span>telecom fraud</span><span>, and stories of those who ended up there rarely ended well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Lillian&mdash;young and attractive&mdash;there was little chance of return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was hauled away, her desperate pleas faded into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian</span><span> looked around coldly with a</span><span> voice boomed through the silence</span><span>,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pathetic lot you are! Thankfully, Mr. Hawthorne's gracious</span><span> enough</span><span>. From now on, we're all one big happy family with the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your perks will double, but if anyone </span><span>ever</span><span> slip</span><span>s a word</span><span>, </span><span>you will be the next</span><span> Lillian!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tense silence hung in the air for a heartbeat before cheers erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Boss! We won't say a thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who'd dare spill the beans? I'll be the first to take them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of doubled pay sealed the deal, uniting their hearts with the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, the atmosphere was thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, are we really just going to let</span><span> go of</span><span> Ian?" Augusta asked, simmering with frustration.</span><span> </span><span>Marvin</span><span> was angry, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alexander remained calm, a glint of confidence in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax. The Fraternity is under our control now. In a few months, we'll fully integrate them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious? Do you actually believe Ian? He's </span><span>the sliest</span><span>," Augusta said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard for him to </span><span>believe</span><span> that their sharp-minded leader could be duped by someone like Ian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A knowing smile crept across Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me. In three months, the Fraternity will be completely absorbed into the Ultimate Alliance, making us one of the top four gangs in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin exchanged glances, skeptical yet drawn in by Alexander's unwavering confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Fraternity backing us, I can finally make my trip to Treasure Island with</span><span> my back covered</span><span>..." Alexander murmured to himself, </span><span>planning</span><span> his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, on the next street over, Ava and Lara were staggering out of a bar, leaning on each other for support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were clearly well past their limits, their cheeks flushed and eyes glassy, their steps unsteady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you jerk..." Lara slurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava giggled, slurr</span><span>ing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... why do you always talk about my guy? Are you... do you like him or what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara gave a light huff. "I already slept with him. He totally took advantage of me... Next time, I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> win. Make him beg for mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava laughed and playfully pinched Lara's ample chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about we go back and sleep with him together? I don't mind if it's you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two wealthy, tipsy women babbled on, their drunken words a mix of laughter and playful threats. Their drivers, trailing behind, could only shake their heads.</span></p></div>
