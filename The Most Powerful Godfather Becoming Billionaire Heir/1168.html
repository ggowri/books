        <h1>Chapter 1168 The Pain's Really Gone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I lie about that?" Alexander said with a laugh, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were crystal clear now, completely free of any desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled the Force through his hands, using special techniques to massage Ava's body, focusing particularly on her lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm, soothing energy flowed through her entire body. Ava felt like she was soaking in a hot spring. It felt absolutely amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued the massage, Alexander gently removed her restrictive clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stunning figure was revealed, all curves and soft skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander kept his mind completely clear, focusing solely on helping her feel better. He steadily channeled the Force into her body, working to ease her discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava lay there, feeling weak and delicate. Her previously pale cheeks had turned a rosy pink, making her look breathtakingly beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her captivating eyes were bright and dewy as she gazed directly at Alexander, radiating an irresistible allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Alexander felt himself responding like any guy would.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he took a deep breath, immediately suppressing those darker urges. She was on her period</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>anything more would only hurt her right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of determination crossed his face as he let out a long breath, finally getting those thoughts under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued treating her as if nothing had happened, staying focused on the healing process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander focused solely on helping Ava, setting aside any other thoughts, he felt himself slip into an incredible state of being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was constantly channeling the Force into Ava's body, his own Force energy wasn't depleting. If anything, it was slowly growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like the universe's energy was automatically flowing into him, converting into the Force. It was way more efficient than his usual meditation sessions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Alexander could suddenly see every detail inside Ava's body with crystal clarity</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>each cell, every muscle fiber, and bone structure. His vision had reached a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was mind-blowing like he could grasp the entire world in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those basic desires and fantasies between men and women, any inappropriate thoughts</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>they'd completely vanished from his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander breathed a sigh of relief. If he hadn't managed to keep his cool just now, the dark energy inside him would have spiked, pushing him closer to becoming a Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he'd passed the test. There was no way he was going to hurt Ava during her period, and his mental fortitude and connection to the Force had grown stronger because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had her eyes closed, completely relaxed and drained of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took her a moment to open her eyes after Alexander pulled his hands away like she was coming out of a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! The </span><span>pain's</span><span> actually gone. I feel so much better. My stomach doesn't hurt at all anymore. Thank you so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't believe it. She never would've guessed Alexander could handle period cramps like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tucked a blanket around her and said softly, "Rest for a bit, and then take a shower. It'll be better for your body that way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned off the lights and gave her a gentle kiss on the forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava didn't resist and just obediently closed her eyes like he suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside the bedroom, Alexander's brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense Rosalia and Charlize's presence</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>one lurking in the shadows down the hall, the other standing guard at her daughter's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lynn was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved Rosalia over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bounded over with a bright smile, draping herself affectionately around him. "Mr. Hawthorne, did you miss me?" she asked playfully, pressing her breasts against him while grabbing his cock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and started squeezing her breast. "Where's Ms. Lynn Blackburn?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, she went shopping," Rosalia replied softly. "She's not back yet, but don't worry. She has security with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, relieved to hear about the security detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just finished giving Ava a therapeutic massage and had been burning with desire, but he held back because Ava was on her period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Rosalia here, there was no way he was letting this opportunity slip by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cupped her breasts with both hands, marveling at their softness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're doing this here. Keep it quiet, or we'll disturb Ms. Blackburn when she gets back</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>and trust me, there won't be a next time if that happens," Alexander warned with a sly grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll be quiet!" Rosalia replied eagerly. She pulled down her pants, turned around, and knelt, presenting her butt to him.</span></p></div>
