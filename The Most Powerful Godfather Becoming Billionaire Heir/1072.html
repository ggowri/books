        <h1>Chapter 1072 Sincere Apology</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine briefly told him why she was here, "My father is Philip Duncan, a researcher in Silver Shield Security. He designed the most advanced bulletproof suit that had the most extraordinary bulletproof effect and couldn't even be pierced by sharp knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the contract, Silver Shield Security should pay us one hundred million dollars for technology transfer. But the chairman, Jordan Nicholson, didn't want to keep promises and forced my dad to hand over all the data... Then, I fled to Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who chased me work for Silver Shield Security. They wanted to bring me back to impel my dad to turn his technology in. Maybe pretending to be from the Ultimate Alliance would save them a lot of trouble since Loscity belongs to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with admiration, "The most advanced bulletproof suit that can defend against sharp knives? It's indeed awesome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at Maxine, he somehow felt he had discovered a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson from Sakra Society would activate the Apocalypse Project again sooner or later, and if the situation really went like those zombie movies when zombies took over the globe, this kind of bulletproof suit with comprehensive capabilities would be absolutely valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Maxine told the whole story, she seemed to lose her last strength and just leaned against the wall, weeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said to her with a smile, "If I can save your dad and give you the due transfer fee, will you transfer this technology to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Maxine jumped up excitedly but immediately felt depressed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You gotta be kidding me. You don't seem to have so much money. Besides, my dad is already under their control, and even the police won't help with it, let alone you..." She shook her head in disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her worries and uneasiness somehow amused him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sly woman sometimes acted like an ignorant child, and she was much more straightforward than he thought. Alexander began to be interested in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reminded her, "Well, since you don't believe me, I think you'd better prepare to run away now because people from the Silver Shield Security will come here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! There's no way they can find me unless you bring them here. If you dare to leak my address, I will kill you." Maxine made a slash gesture around her neck to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't bring them here. If they simply tailed me to this place, please believe me that I really didn't mean it. I'm sorry." Alexander shrugged with innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You... You must have let them follow you on purpose! I'll kill you!" Maxine shouted furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so sorry, but they seem to be downstairs and will come up soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled as he heard the hasty footsteps coming from the lower floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rushed upstairs, and given the denser sound of footsteps, there were at least a dozen people this time, which obviously outnumbered the bunch of people Alexander beat up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door of Maxine's house was kicked open, and those men in black stampeded into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their leader was a middle-aged man in his forties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cigarette in his mouth, he puffed out a smoke ring from time to time with a fierce gleam in his slightly swollen, fish-shaped eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When scanning Alexander and Maxine, he slightly raised his head and looked extremely arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're trespassing on my private property. Get out, or I'll call the police!" Maxine shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if you choose to believe me and apologize to me sincerely, I will consider taking you out of this place. Otherwise, you will definitely fall into their hands." Alexander didn't seem to panic at all and said to Maxine casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are... Are you really capable of saving my dad?" Although she was still suspicious of his words, she had subconsciously hid behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her smartness, she was too weak to fight a dozen men, not to mention she could run away. Alexander was the only one she could count on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said with an amicable smile, "I said I can save your father and give you one hundred million dollars plus a complimentary gift to help you get rid of these guys in exchange for that bulletproof technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But first, you have to apologize to me for your previous behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he stood aside to show those men the Maxine behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two bastards, why do you stop running? Come on, let me see how good you're at escaping. I'll kill you both anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That middle-aged man threw the cigarette butt to the ground and trampled it with a grin.</span></p></div>
