        <h1>Chapter 933 Full Fire</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. Timothy was under his control through the Force&mdash;there was no way he'd betray him unless he wanted to face a fate worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something had clearly gone wrong with Timothy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, headlights appeared at the end of the road, the sound of engines rumbling steadily growing louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne quickly gave orders to her subordinates to prepare for combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screech of tires echoed through the night as enemy vehicles came into view. Alexander's sharp eyes caught sight of at least three armored vehicles in the convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia had really gone all out&mdash;armed helicopters, armored vehicles. This was no small-scale operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one of the armored vehicles, Arthur grabbed Timothy by the collar and snarled, </span><span>"Why did our helicopter crash? Tell me, did you warn Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy let out a manic laugh, his eyes wild. "Arthur, you traitor! It's one thing to betray me, but you're going against Alexander? You're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enraged, Arthur slapped Timothy across the face with a brutal force. "Timothy, I've been wanting to get rid of you for a long time. Since you've betrayed the Godfather, I'll be taking your place. Alexander's as good as dead today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Arthur kicked Timothy to the ground and barked at his men, "Check if they have any heavy weaponry. Fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men immediately deployed thermal imaging and night vision to scan the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week earlier, Arthur had betrayed Timothy to the Mafia's higher-ups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The organization had sent a team to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> to capture Timothy and install Arthur as the new boss of the Mafia's local operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that Alexander was back in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, Arthur had been ecstatic. He immediately mobilized his forces and, using his new position, rented a helicopter and three armored vehicles from the local military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur had assumed that such overwhelming firepower would make short work of Alexander. But he never expected the helicopter to be brought down so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy, his hands bound and his face swollen and bruised, grinned maliciously. "Arthur, you're finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming with rage, Arthur pulled out a gun and aimed it at Timothy's head. "Keep talking, and I'll blow your brains out right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, one of his men reported, "Boss, we've checked. They don't have any heavy weapons, and their numbers are only about half ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur's brow furrowed in suspicion. There was a gnawing feeling in his gut, like a prickling sensation down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his teeth. "Surround them. Open fire. Leave no survivors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His convoy immediately sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three armored vehicles and a dozen off-road trucks, each armed with several mounted machine guns, formed a formidable assault force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over thirty fully armed soldiers disembarked from the vehicles, quickly setting up a battle formation to close in on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The machine guns on the armored vehicles locked onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, what do we do now?" Yvonne's voice held a hint of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her subordinates were armed with only pistols, and in a direct fire exchange, they would be wiped out in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with her witchcraft, she could only hope for a mutual destruction in the face of such overwhelming firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, waved his hand dismissively. "Just stay hidden. I'll take care of the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he vanished into the night, his form dissolving into the darkness like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding beam of light shot out, effortlessly slicing through one of the armored vehicles, splitting it in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the gunner barely had time to react before he was decapitated by the force of the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, a scorching white fire ignited within the vehicle, and with a deafening explosion, the vehicle's ammunition went up in flames, sending debris flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave took down a large portion of the soldiers nearby, their bodies crumpling like ragdolls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur stood frozen for a moment, his mind scrambling to catch up, before he bellowed orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air erupted with gunfire, hundreds of bullets tearing through the night, chasing after Alexander's elusive form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how fierce the gunfire, they couldn't touch him&mdash;not even a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second armored vehicle exploded in a burst of flames, as Alexander destroyed it effortlessly. Its ammunition also detonated, creating another massive fireball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two destroyed armored vehicles now burned like massive bonfires, casting enough light to make the night feel like day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there, standing in front of the wreckage, was Alexander, like some kind of demonic figure. A smile tugged at his lips as he stared down the last armored vehicle in the convoy.</span></p></div>
