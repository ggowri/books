        <h1>Chapter 218 Enjoyment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a normal man, so he couldn't bear it any longer and pressed on her immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had transformed into a great sculptor and began to carefully carve his work. He stimulated Charlize's nerves and made her feel indescribable pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, my God, you so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize couldn't help but hum softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hands used the Force, which could stimulate people's desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Alexander's movements, Charlize felt like she was about to die, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander... Did you do something bad to me? I feel completely different..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize was controlled by the strange warm current and could only hum involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and enjoyed Charlize's coquettish look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the stimulation of the Force, no woman could resist it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize entangled Alexander like a snake, enjoying the happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doorbell suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, who was limp, tried to get up, but Alexander held her down and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are exhausted just now. Take a good rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just made love for two hours. This time, Alexander was more relaxed than ever before. And only someone with a physical fitness like Charlize could barely endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize blushed and said, "Is Ms. Blackburn back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander comforted her. "It should not be. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked outside through the surveillance camera and saw Julia. She was with Xavier, holding gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia said with a smile, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry to have come to visit you without your permission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier told you what I said, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia blushed and said with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I don't ask to become the head of the Ulysses family. I just want to keep the Phoenix Gemstone Establishment. Because it was left by my late husband, I should protect it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia showed a resolute expression, and her tone was firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said calmly, "Don't worry. I will let you be the head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please take back these gifts. The Ulysses family is going to compete with the Carter family tomorrow. I will go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia was stunned at first, then overjoyed. "Mr. Hawthorne, you didn't lie to me, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Why would I lie to you? As for the Kaylon, I will talk to Sir Stewart in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia smiled brightly and quickly reminded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I heard that the Carter family and Aiden have hired experts. You must be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head contemptuously. "They're no threat to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia thanked him and left with Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By letting Julia become the head of the Ulysses family, Alexander would be indirectly in control of Gemstone Street. It would be much more convenient for him to get any gems in the future, which made Alexander look forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While thinking, Alexander walked towards Charlize and picked her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize said coquettishly, "Please forgive me. I can't take it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Don't worry. I'm just giving you a bath. You're sweaty and uncomfortable, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize snorted softly and buried her head in Alexander's arms, allowing him to carry her into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for how long she could be with Alexander, Charlize had never considered it, let alone thought about competing with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize just loved Alexander and was happy with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what happened in the future, this would be a happy and joyful experience for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Julia drove to pick up Alexander to go to Gemstone Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Carter family and Aiden had arrived a long time ago. There was a fighting arena at the street corner and quite a few people had gathered around it, all coming to watch the fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica said, "Kevin, be quick to win. We'll go to the movies later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snuggled in Kevin's arms and acted coquettishly.</span></p></div>
