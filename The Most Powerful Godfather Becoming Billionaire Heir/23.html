        <h1>Chapter 23 Arrogance?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A harsh laugh echoed through the room as Emma's anger bubbled over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, who do you think you are? You're nothing but discarded trash. Even with a century's grace, you'd never be worthy of Ms. Blackburn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a flick of impatience, Alexander waved her away. "Leave. I have no wish to see you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's response was a haughty snort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've encountered many men who seek to leech off women. You must believe Ms. Blackburn is just another rich girl. Am I right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me enlighten you. You're sorely mistaken. Ms. Blackburn is the head of the Saint Group. Given your Loscity roots, you can't possibly be ignorant of the Saint Group, can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With smug satisfaction, Emma fixed her gaze on Alexander, expecting his reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Alexander remained unperturbed. His calm was almost serene, with just the slightest curl of mockery at the corners of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what if she's the president of the Saint Group? She still has two eyes and one nose. What makes her different?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His icy tone ignited a fury within Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you show such disrespect to the Saint Group and Ms. Blackburn?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you insane? Do you not comprehend the vast chasm between you and Ms. Blackburn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander only smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Love is free and knows no bounds of age or social status. It's not something a petty person like you can meddle with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I'm not mistaken, you've been bribed by someone to promote them to Ms. Blackburn, which is why you dislike me. Am I right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face blanched, and she took a step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt as though Alexander's eyes could see right through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nonsense! If you value your life, stay away from Ms. Blackburn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma hissed before fleeing the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander scoffed at her retreating figure and mused silently, "The woman, as insignificant as an ant, thought to disrupt my relationship with Ava, only to be squashed with a mere flick of my finger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Emma's footsteps had faded into silence, Alexander called out calmly, "Come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door swung open to reveal a graceful figure stepping into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, are you alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voice belonged to Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne donned a black leather jacket today, which hugged her curvaceous figure perfectly, accentuating the deep, alluring cleavage that peeked out from her chest. She exuded a blend of sensuality and a warrior's spirit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander replied, "I'm fine. Who sent the assassin this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was as cold as the arctic wind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even with the best of tempers, his patience had worn thin; the relentless string of assassination attempts was something he could no longer abide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne frowned. "We're still investigating. It's either Mr. Augustine Hawthorne or Mr. Anthony Hawthorne; there's no third option."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Track down the assassin. I'll trace the killer back to the puppeteer," Alexander ordered with steely determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As you wish, Mr. Hawthorne," Anne replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bent forward slightly, allowing her plump breasts to momentarily catch Alexander's eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A stir of desire flickered within him as he gazed at her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne, his trusted lieutenant, possessed not only a sharp mind but also an allure in her beauty and form. Alexander knew that to secure his peace of mind, he would eventually claim her as his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, I've handpicked four bodyguards. They're all former warriors with combat experience, each with a history of vanquishing foes," Anne explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gestured for four tall, muscular men in black to enter the room. They stood before Alexander like impenetrable towers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The men in black regarded Alexander with a mix of awe and curiosity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, they can provide you with close protection. Your safety is paramount; you mustn't be harmed again," Anne declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having never witnessed Alexander's prowess firsthand, Anne was naturally fraught with concern for his safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their first encounter was nearly Alexander's last; he would have fallen to the assassin's bullet had her team not intervened at the critical moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her eyes, despite his cunning and abilities, Alexander remained in constant peril.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander cast a fleeting look over the quartet before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I appreciate your intentions, but I require no guardianship. Nor could they offer it effectively."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne frowned in disapproval because she believed Alexander's confidence bordered on arrogance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawthorne, these four are exceptionally skilled. They could easily fend off a dozen or more adversaries, and they pledge to respect your autonomy, speaking not a word of your affairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With an air of detachment, Alexander responded, "They might excel against the common man, but they would find themselves outmatched by me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A ripple of discontent passed over the faces of the four men clad in black.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite their reverence for Alexander, their own sense of honor was not to be underestimated.</p></div>
