        <h1>Chapter 487 Fantasies</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Lynn standing dazed at the door, Alexander quickly called out. "Ms. Lynn Blackburn, you must be tired. Why don't you go take a shower? Dinner will be ready soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... what are you doing cooking? Aren't you supposed to be out with Ava?" Lynn asked, her expression one of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, Alexander had exposed Victor as a fraud, which had led to her publicly scolding him. Deep down, Lynn felt a sense of guilt towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Alexander approached and took her hand, leading her to the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is your birthday, so Ava asked me to celebrate it with you on her behalf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn felt the warmth of his hand, and her cheeks flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently pushed her toward the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go take a shower first. We can chat while we eat. Are you afraid I might slip something into your food? Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's face turned even redder at the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had some doubts, she didn't protest; after all, he was her daughter's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, after a day of shopping, she definitely needed to freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she undressed and turned on the shower, the warm droplets invigorated her, and her skin glowed under the heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She applied fragrant shower gel, rubbing it in as she went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accidentally brushing over her chest made Lynn shiver slightly, and she couldn't help but let her hand drift lower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing her eyes, she let out a soft gasp as waves of sensation coursed through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been several days since Victor disappeared, and she hadn't been with a man since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise, thoughts of Alexander and the times she had caught glimpses of him with her daughter flooded her mind&mdash;this wasn't the first time it had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, the scene shifted; her daughter transformed into her own reflection, as Alexander held her tightly from behind...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening to me today?" Lynn thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was incredulous that she was having such fantasies. She knew it was wrong, dangerous even, yet she couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was not just her daughter's boyfriend but also her benefactor. Had he not exposed Victor, her life would be far more difficult now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite knowing this, Lynn found it impossible to push him out of her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was guilt over misjudging him, gratitude, or her own attraction to strong men, thoughts of him lingered stubbornly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." she gasped, feeling unsteady, and sank to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After standing under the water for a while, she snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pinched her thigh hard, her face burning. "Am I going crazy? What am I thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her shower, she surprised herself by putting on makeup and selecting a delicate pink lace lingerie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing before the mirror, she admired her reflection, realizing that time had only enhanced her mature allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would Alexander think if he saw her like this? Would he pounce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly pinched herself again to dismiss such absurd thoughts, yet a thrill coursed through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she was ready, she walked to the dining table where Alexander stood, a true gentleman, pulling out a chair for her with a smile. "Please sit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander. I appreciate all the trouble you went through to make dinner," Lynn said, feeling shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened a bottle of wine and poured her a glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was no trouble at all. Cooking is my specialty. If you like it, a reward would be nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A reward? What kind of reward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful grin, he glanced at her cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That depends on what you want to reward me with. I'm not interested in the ordinary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Lynn's cheeks flushed. His words reminded her of Victor, who had also sought rewards from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's All-seeing Eyes was impressive; he seemed to catch every subtle change in her expression and could likely guess half of what she was thinking.</span></p></div>
