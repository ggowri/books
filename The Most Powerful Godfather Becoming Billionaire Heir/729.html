        <h1>Chapter 729 I Will Kill You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was obviously a cripple, but he moved as fast as lightning, as if he was a swift cheetah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised the machete and swung it through the air, slicing hard at Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked so fierce that it made Alexander's cold sweat run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes were filled with surprise, and he looked so excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was the fastest of the enemies Alexander had met so far, and even Felix couldn't match him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was incredible to Alexander that a cripple could train his body to such a powerful point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if Bruno were fast, he had no advantage under Alexander's All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't activate his Lightsabers but threw a punch instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force was wrapped around Alexander's fist, which was indestructible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're strong, but if you want to help the Mafia out, your power won't be enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander punched Bruno's machete hard with his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't pull any tricks and the Force looked extremely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crack, Bruno's machete couldn't withstand the collision of two powerful forces and was suddenly snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fell backward three steps with his arm around Ava, and they were motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno flew fifty feet backwards as if he had been hit by a speeding heavy truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno rolled over and fell to the ground, looking at the half-broken machete in his </span><span>hand as his face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Bruno wasn't injured, he obviously lost the battle, and he wasn't as powerful as Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Alexander had his arm around Ava, and he looked so relaxed that he obviously didn't use his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno couldn't help but feel ashamed and annoyed, and he was excited in his mind at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you are truly something! I've never met an opponent like you before, and you're stronger than I thought. No wonder you're not afraid of the Mafia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno didn't feel the slightest bit intimidated but rather excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bright eyes were filled with a sense of optimism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unprecedentedly strong opponent made Bruno become extremely thrilled, as if he was back in the primitive jungle to fight with the beasts to death, and the sense of crisis came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the ear-piercing sound of sirens rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several police cars were speeding this way, and there were people running in panic from a short distance away. It was definitely that Dick's murderous massacre of two families had been discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno glanced indifferently at the police cars and the crowd that was beginning to gather not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, wait for me. I'll come back for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno turned his back after a few steps and told Ava with a complicated expression, "Alexander is an asshole, and you should leave him, or you'll regret it someday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Do I need you to mind my business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rolled her eyes at Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno saved Ava just now. Ava had been grateful to him, but he tried to kill Alexander, which made Ava so angry and resentful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno looked so furious as he glared at Alexander. "I will definitely kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, he left quickly. He was obviously a cripple, but he was like a nimble beast and disappeared rapidly around the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's from the Mafia. Brandon must have sent him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander seemed to be thinking about something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno was like a beast peering in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander hadn't been afraid that Ava and his daughter were in danger, he would have gone after them and nipped the threat all in the bud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An abandoned cabin on the outskirts of </span><span>Loscity</span><span> was transformed into a temporary home by Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bruno returned, he immediately began to tinker with his machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He built a large fireplace in the cabin, where the coke burned flamingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the finest coke, and the fire was so strong that it looked very bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bluer the flame, the higher the temperature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the weather was cool, it was scorching hot in the room, making Bruno feel like he was in a sea of fire from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coke had a high ignition point, so the fire was so strong that it would normally be used in steelworks to make steel, and not likely in a clay stove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno also used a blower to send air desperately toward the coke ovens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, just wait. I'm going to get you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno cursed as he tinkered and forged his machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded quite clear, sometimes loud, and sometimes quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ava, you're a bitch. It was obvious that I fell in love with you at first sight, but why didn't you believe me? You had to give your body to an asshole like Alexander to play with. You are such a whore. How dare you ignore me? Just wait and see."</span></p></div>
