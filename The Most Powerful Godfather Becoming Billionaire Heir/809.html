        <h1>Chapter 809 Revenge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aidan's chest was simultaneously pierced and charred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After letting out a short, piercing scream, Aidan fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never would have thought that Alexander would suddenly appear in front of him, and even the hardest shield in the world could not withstand a single strike from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alexander killed Aidan with one sword, he sneered and vanished into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asshole, you dare to kill my brother!" Casper roared in anger, putting all his strength into the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a series of clatters from his combat armor, and four jets of flame spewed from the energy pack on his back, suddenly increasing Casper's speed by several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!" Casper, like a bolt of lightning, caught up behind Alexander, raised his battle knife, and roared as he fiercely slashed at Alexander's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The material of this battle knife was not only special metal, but the blade also incorporated the most advanced technology, inlaid with countless tiny diamond particles, giving it a powerful cutting ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even light armor could be penetrated by this battle knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where is he?" Casper's strike landed on nothing; just a moment ago, he had clearly seen Alexander right in front of him, but in an instant, Alexander vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding the knife with both hands, he panted heavily while cautiously searching all around for any trace of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Casper, watch out!" suddenly, Kermit shouted and forcefully pushed Casper away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An incredibly dashing man was descending from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander leaped high into the air silently; due to his incredible speed, no one noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed like a deity descending from the heavens, thrusting his sword down from mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill him!" Kermit roared in anger, brandishing his battle blade that could cut through iron like butter. The sharp edge, embedded with countless diamond particles, reflected the cold moonlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, the combat armor spewed out flames once again, causing Kermit's speed to increase dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kermit's strike instantly became several times faster, the sharp blade thrusting toward Alexander's abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, his entire body in mid-air and unable to dodge, seemed as if he would be pierced by Kermit in the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the critical moment, Alexander smiled and said, "Not bad. I didn't expect the Dragon Gang to have such advanced combat armor that can significantly increase speed. It's a pity you met me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he utilized the Force, performing the Force Confinement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ever since Alexander acquired the ability to see through objects and reached the peak of an Intermediate Warrior, he hadn't used this move for a very long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the entire world seemed to have stopped, and even time itself had come to a standstill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Alexander, everyone's movements became slower than snails. The expressions on their faces, whether fierceness, excitement, thrill, or fear, were all so vivid and clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Kermit's speed was a bit faster than the others, but only by a tiny bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If others were snails, he was a turtle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his eyes, everyone's movements had slowed to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander instantly spotted several flaws in Kermit's attacks. Like a ghost, he appeared behind Kermit and, with one sword strike, decapitated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The world instantly returned to normal. Kermit's head flew into the air, his face contorted with a grimace, while his body and sword crashed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kermit!" Casper, seeing his brother's tragic death, instantly teared up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were the three major leaders of the Dragon Gang and also brothers. In the blink of an eye, only he was left, all alone and pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though they were Risun warriors, possessing firearm power and wearing combat armor, two of them were quickly killed by Alexander in a three-against-one situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must avenge them!" Casper gritted his teeth, wanting to tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lifted the machine gun with his left hand, gripped the battle knife with his right, and unexpectedly turned around, charging towards Augusta and Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Subsequently, Casper opened fire fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta and Marvin reacted quickly and dodged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others fell to the ground in unison, rolling continuously to avoid the dense hail of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in the face of Casper wielding firearm power, some were a bit too slow, and several fell into pools of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll slaughter you!" Casper laughed maniacally and continued to fire fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he couldn't beat Alexander, so he could only kill the others to vent his hatred.</span></p></div>
