        <h1>Chapter 472 Weak Yet Playful</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander shuddered violently on Ava's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a soft whimper, and Lynn couldn't take it anymore either. She hurried into the bathroom, not even bothering to lock the door, and sat down on the toilet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." Lynn trembled, finally letting out a wave of uncontrollable need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat there for quite a while before she calmed down. Just as she was about to leave, the bathroom door swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood there, completely bare. Lynn froze, staring at his strong physique and what was hanging between his legs, completely speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander licked his lips. He could see Lynn's smooth thighs, flushed and glistening with moisture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I... I was just..." Lynn blushed, stumbling over her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, I should be the one apologizing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gulped and quickly backed out, closing the door behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the other room, Ava had just come out of the shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Alexander's awkward expression and lazily asked,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Weren't you going to shower next door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing. You're done, so I'll just shower here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly entered the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava watched him curiously, feeling like something might have happened just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander came out of the shower, Ava was already fast asleep, exhausted from earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his mind was a mess, the image of Lynn's mature, sensual body still lingering. He needed to get his act together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused the Force, pushing down the fire inside until he was calm again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mentally reviewed the gems he had acquired that day. Though they were only of high quality, the haul wasn't bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, the lucky find of the premium ruby was a huge bonus. Alexander focused his thoughts, and the hilt of his energy sword appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the premium ruby and moved it toward the core of the sword's energy source.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoosh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ruby was sucked in instantly, and the magical array emitted a radiant glow, clearly boosting the aura of the weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not bad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of excitement. Once he found six more gemstones in the remaining colors, he could upgrade the sword from level one to level two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his phone chimed with a message. It was Timothy, sending over Victor Hughes' background file&mdash;everything from his childhood onward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just as I thought, a complete fraud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed with determination as he scanned the document.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did a good job, Timothy. Well done. After tomorrow's auction, take me to find Hughes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy read Alexander's response and felt a thrill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He excitedly turned to Arthur, "Did you see that? The boss said I did a good job!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur rolled his eyes, "You think Alexander's got his eye on both mother and daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy squinted, a wicked smile forming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What man doesn't like beautiful women? Honestly, I've been interested in Lynn Blackburn for a long time but never had the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he's got her, at least we won't have to worry about any trouble. What's not to like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arthur nodded in agreement. "Yeah, that's good for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>.....</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, the golden sunlight filtered through the window, warming Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something tickled his nose, making him wake up. He opened his eyes to see Ava mischievously brushing her hair across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava grinned down at him, their eyes meeting. The warm breath on her face made her feel all tingly, a sudden rush of desire surging through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lazy bum, time to get up! We can't miss the auction," she said, quickly getting out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tease me and then just walk away? You're really both weak and a player."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed her, pulling her back into his arms. His hand slipped inside her neckline, cupping her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face turned crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pervert! We need to get ready for the auction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already blushing hot, her body heating up, struggling to keep her cool.</span></p></div>
