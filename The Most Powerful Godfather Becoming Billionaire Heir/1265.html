        <h1>Chapter 1265 Emergency Evacuation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved like lightning, suddenly appearing in front of the man. He grabbed him by the throat and lifted him into the air with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell that son of a bitch Yinson he's a dead man walking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the man struggled to breathe in Alexander's iron grip, he kept grinning like a madman, showing no trace of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes narrowed. Something wasn't right about this guy&mdash;he had to be another one of Sakra Society's test subjects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you... can you hear it?" the man stuttered through choked breaths. "Mr. White wants you to... to taste true fear! You'll all live in terror..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hear what?" Alexander thought. His suspicion grew. He expanded his awareness, letting his senses reach out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force spread like radar waves, picking up every sound and feeding it directly to his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scream pierced the air from somewhere far away. Then came another, and another. Chaos began to erupt all across the silent streets of Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a sinking feeling about what was happening. He tightened his grip on the man's throat. Even as he gasped for air, the man didn't beg for mercy. Instead, he let out a twisted laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apocalypse Project is now active... You're all... all dead. There won't be a place left for you on this planet&mdash;only fear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snapped the man's neck with one twist, dropping the body like garbage onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swept his arm through the air. "Initiate emergency evacuation protocol&mdash;everyone to Treasure Island, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his urgency, Ava rushed back to her room to grab her phone and start making calls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander hadn't seen the chaos firsthand, he knew Loscity was about to face a real crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless something changed fast, they'd be dealing with the living dead, zombies, and mutant beasts. The whole world would descend into mayhem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That old bastard Yinson must have cut a deal with some higher-ups to land his top position at the Ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander's phone rang. It was Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you need to get the hell out of Loscity," Gavin spoke urgently. "Some people at the Ghost have lost their minds. They've teamed up with Yinson to launch this insane plan.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>They want to wipe out most civilians while collecting research data to perfect the Immortality Serum. This obsession with immortality has driven them completely crazy.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost's split into two factions now, both fighting for control of the military. You won't be getting any army backup for a while. I've already gotten Grace safely to Avalora. Watch your backs out there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worry in Gavin's voice was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for the heads up," Alexander replied grimly. "We're evacuating right now. You stay safe too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the call ended, three black helicopters appeared in the sky, rapidly approaching the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had long prepared for emergency evacuations, with three helicopters and pilots on standby 24/7 at the Ultimate Alliance headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ultimate Alliance sprang into action immediately after Ava's call to Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The helicopters touched down on the lawn, and everyone quickly boarded&mdash;Lynn, Lily, Ava, Ashley, and the others. Betty, Rebecca, and several high-ranking Ultimate Alliance executives, including Mary, were already aboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Augusta, I need all of you to head to Louvian Port," Alexander commanded without hesitation. "Karson will meet you there and escort you to Treasure Island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and the others didn't waste any time. They knew staying behind would only slow Alexander down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched as the three helicopters lifted off, carrying his most precious people toward Louvian Port. Within moments, they disappeared into the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Alexander let out a breath of relief. He turned his attention to the Loscity Police Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Grace and Gavin were safely in Avalora, and Brittany's security wasn't a concern, Melin was still at the police station. Alexander was determined to get her out too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos had erupted at the Loscity Police Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Monsters!" an officer screamed in terror. "The living dead and zombies are back, and their numbers are exploding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My leg... this huge mutant dog got me," a blood-soaked officer crawled across the floor, pleading. "Someone stop the bleeding... I don't want to die..." But everyone rushed past him, too focused on their own survival to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver's face had turned ghostly white as he frantically barked orders, demanding his officers fortify their defenses to keep the monsters at bay.</span></p></div>
