        <h1>Chapter 621 Suffering a Big Loss</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan's face turned livid, and he was so angry that he couldn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Mr. Tate, you are so rich. You spent thirty million dollars to buy a big rock. Don't waste this pile of rocks. You can transport it back to build a road or something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a burst of snickering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tate, what should we do now?" Sandy asked, stuttering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan turned around and slapped her in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have bought this stone. Get lost! I don't want to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tate... This is not my fault..." Sandy covered her swollen cheeks and cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!" Evan kicked her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and said, "This is what you sow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia snorted, feeling very happy about Sandy's being dumped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan turned around and yelled at Alexander, "Brat, if you hadn't deliberately bid against me, would I have spent so much money? You must be responsible for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "How about we make a bet? If I can find an ore with a high-grade gem, I win. If I can't, I lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I lose, I'll pay you fifty million dollars, and if you lose, you'll return the exchange to Olivia. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was so angry that his face turned red, and he cursed, "You bastard! If you want the exchange, what's the point of messing with me? Go mess with Mafia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Evan with contempt as if he was looking at an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you the person in charge of the exchange now? If I win the exchange from you, it is legal. If Mafia dares to come to Loscity to cause trouble again, Ultimate Alliance will not let them go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan shuddered with fear. "Are you from Ultimate Alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimate Alliance had integrated several major forces and was now the largest force in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said coldly, "Stop talking nonsense. Do you dare to bet? If you don't dare, get out of Loscity. Ultimate Alliance will protect this exchange from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan gritted his teeth and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that the people from Ultimate Alliance had been lying in ambush outside, ready to rush in at any time, but he hadn't made any preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the twenty or thirty Mafia members left in Loscity were all gathered together, they would be no match for Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan thought for a long time and finally agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll make a bet with you. If you can cut out a high-grade gem, I'll lose. If you can't, you will lose. You have to pay me fifty million dollars, and you are not allowed to interfere with my exchange again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these words, everyone stared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ignore him. The conditions are too harsh. Don't bet with him." Olivia grabbed Alexander's </span><span>sleeve,</span><span> her beautiful eyes full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought that Alexander wouldn't agree. After all, finding an ore containing a high-grade gem was very difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander agreed without any hesitation. "Okay, I'll take the bet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan grinned grimly, thinking he was about to turn the tables. He didn't believe that Alexander could find an ore containing a high-grade gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander will lose to Mr. Tate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think so too. He is so young and has no experience. He will suffer a big loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tate will make a comeback by winning this bet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were talking about it, ready to watch the good show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already identified some ores through his All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from the light flashing in those ores, they were very likely to be top-grade gems, but he still needed to confirm it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paced slowly in the hall, walking around the ores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes passed, but he still hadn't made a choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone started whispering, thinking that Alexander had no confidence and would lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was a little nervous at first, but now he calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Brat, weren't you very arrogant just now? Hahaha, if you can't give me fifty million later, I will kill you!"</span></p></div>
