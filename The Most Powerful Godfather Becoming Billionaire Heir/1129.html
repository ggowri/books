        <h1>Chapter 1129 You've Been Tricked</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier blushed and said sheepishly, "It's nothing serious. In fact, I have some relationship problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing. "I am surprised that a playboy like you will be troubled by love. Xavier, tell me, who made you so distressed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier scratched his head and chuckled, "Alexander, when it comes to being a playboy, you are much better than me. There are so many stunning beauties around you. I will be overjoyed if I can date one of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed again. "Stop flattering me and get straight to the point."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering for a while, Xavier said, "I</span><span> </span><span>met a woman and have been dating her for a month. I planned to propose to her. H-However, just a few days ago, she suddenly </span><span>behave</span><span> like a different person..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Alas</span><span>, do you think this is retribution for me? I have deceived so many girls in the past that God punishes me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier drank another glass and put it heavily on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? A month... </span><span>S</span><span>uddenly be</span><span>have</span><span> like a different person..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, thinking that there was something strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Xavier was talking just now, Alexander quietly activated the Force Sense and discovered that there was a dark energy within Xavier, which was actually the same poison that Gavin had suffered from!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe the woman approached Xavier to poison him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she made it and had to stay away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm. Instead of exposing it, he wondered who might attack Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was to target the Ultimate Alliance, or maybe it was an enemy that Xavier had offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, filled up Xavier's glass, and said, "Xavier, if you trust me, I will help you solve this matter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Boss, can you help me find Olivia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier became excited, completely believing in Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier, you haven't even noticed that you've been tricked. If we hadn't met today, you would be in trouble..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused and didn't make it clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>T</span><span>ricked? What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier became anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he regained his composure, Alexander said firmly, "Someone targeted you and poisoned you. It might be someone else or your beloved woman, Olivia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Poisoning? It's impossible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone else had made such a statement, he would have already slapped them in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was Alexander. Xavier had witnessed his power with his own eyes and had complete faith in his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"S-She won't hurt me. It must be someone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Xavier quivered uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Don't worry. Fortunately, you were poisoned for a short time, and I can detoxicate you completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you will be dead in a while! Think carefully. Besides Olivia, have you offended anyone recently, or are there any traitors around you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Offending </span><span>others</span><span>? Traitors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier frowned and racked his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I </span><span>see</span><span>. Half a month ago, I hired a male assistant who had graduated from a prestigious university. He is on good terms with Olivia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, on reflection, I think there's something wrong with him. He has a bright future. Why did he apply to be my assistant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I offered him a decent salary, he could have a better career."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and said, "Think carefully if there is anything unusual between him and Olivia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes</span><span>, you</span><span>'</span><span>ve got the point</span><span>. They seemed very familiar with each other the moment they met. I even wondered if they had known each other beforehand, but I thought it was an illusion at th</span><span>at</span><span> time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Xavier sent a copy of the assistant's detailed information to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tobias White... Twenty-five... From Risun? Wait - he must be connected to Yinson from the Sakra Society. That's it!" Alexander's eyes turned deadly as the pieces clicked together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yinson had been picking off Alexander's people one by one, and his cunning brutality was worse than anything Alexander had expected.</span></p></div>
