        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually</span><span> the poised and elegant CEO of the Brilliant Group, Cloe was now on her knees in front of Alexander, moving her hips seductively, her face flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, most women have a little bit of a submissive side when they're with the man they love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this degrading position only made Cloe feel even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly undid Alexander's belt, then unzipped his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her rush, she pulled down both his pants and boxers, and Alexander's length sprang free, unrestrained like a cannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked down at her, feeling a rush of excitement as he felt himself swell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was right in front of Cloe's face, close enough that she could see every detail, even catch a faint scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's lips parted slightly, her expression filled with awe and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so big... and it's got that dark color, with all those veins like little ridges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks kind of intimidating, but I love it. I can't get enough&mdash;it's the most incredible thing in the world. I can hardly stand it, I'm so excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wish I could have it all the time. I'd even fall asleep with it in my mouth or keep it inside me forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe babbled on like she was losing her mind, and Alexander couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out and gently held him, feeling the firmness and warmth, her eyes full of fascination as she continued her praises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath, trying to keep his excitement in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still a bit worried someone might walk in&mdash;this whole situation was giving him a massive thrill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander placed his hand on the back of her head, guiding her toward him, brushing himself against her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe knew exactly what Alexander needed. She looked up at him with eyes full of desire and playfulness, then opened her mouth to take him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poised CEO of the Brilliant Group, dressed in her sharp business suit, makeup perfectly applied, was now on her knees, willingly wrapping her lips around his manhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately felt the warmth and wetness, letting out a low groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe began tightening her lips around him, slowly taking him deeper, creating that perfect pressure that sent waves of pleasure through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but groan again. Her mouth was as skilled as he remembered, reminding him of Norma Walsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Cloe had practiced&mdash;every small move was designed to drive Alexander wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worked him slowly at first, taking him almost entirely, then pulling back, her head moving in a steady, sultry rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's breathing grew ragged. He grabbed hold of Cloe's head, keeping her still as he began to move his hips faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each thrust was powerful, reaching deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe gagged occasionally from Alexander's intensity&mdash;he was just that rough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that roughness only made it more thrilling for both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few minutes, Cloe's eyes were rolling back from the intensity, and Alexander finally let go of her, albeit reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair was all over the place, and as soon as he released her, she started coughing and gagging, her lips still wet and glistening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed her breast roughly, giving her an order,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get over to the toilet, kneel, pull down your panties, and stick that slut ass up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were crude, but that crudeness and dominance only made it even more exciting for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's beautiful face was flushed, her </span><span>whole body</span><span> trembling with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up, pulling down her skirt, revealing a pair of pink thong panties underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thin straps seemed to disappear into the cleft of her perfect backside, barely visible and incredibly enticing.</span></p></div>
