        <h1>Chapter 448 The Intrusion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they could no longer feel the pain. They had all passed out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitstaff and hostesses, witnessing this, retreated in fear, staring at Alexander in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe someone would dare to cause trouble at the Pegasus Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode into the club. He kicked the luxurious and imposing doors off their hinges, causing them to crash to the ground and eliciting screams of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what do you think you're doing?" a manager-like man asked, trembling and </span><span>unable to meet Alexander's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Kyle?" Alexander's deep eyes were filled with murderous intent, his voice cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone felt a shiver down their spine, breaking out in cold sweats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what do you want with Mr. Vanderbilt..." the manager stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed the manager by the neck, lifting him as if he were a chick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager struggled desperately, his face turning red from lack of oxygen, soon purpling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, where is Kyle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked again, increasing the pressure on the manager's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager made pained noises, flailing like a drowning man, but still didn't reveal Kyle's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me. Where is Kyle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice suddenly softened, accompanied by an irresistible charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Alexander had used Force Control after his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having crafted the Lightsaber, Alexander had improved his strength and absorbed much of James' Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager was just an ordinary person, unable to withstand Alexander's Force. He was instantly dazed, feeling as if Alexander was his elder, his master, and the most trustworthy person in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt is in room 111!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager finally revealed the room number where Kyle was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having gotten </span><span>the answer</span><span> he wanted, Alexander flung the manager away. The manager fell to the ground like trash, clutching his neck and gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode towards room 111.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop. What do you think you're doing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Security personnel tried to stop Alexander along the way, but they were either knocked down by a punch or, upon meeting his gaze, seemed bewitched and stumbled aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of trained elites lay sprawled across the long corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved with ease, like a beast among a flock of sheep, free to wreak havoc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to block him anymore. Alexander followed the signs forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pegasus Club, a high-end club in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, was decorated with opulence, reminiscent of a medieval palace, immersive in its grandeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd of security personnel followed Alexander, but they were intimidated, only daring to follow from a distance, too afraid to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were like sheep fearing a lion king. A single glance from Alexander would send them retreating in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander arrived outside room 111.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight burly, black-suited bodyguards stood in two rows outside the resplendent golden doors, like towers guarding the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their muscles strained against their </span><span>suits,</span><span> handguns tucked at their waists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had come so fast that they hadn't even been notified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading bald man blocked Alexander with one hand while placing the other on the handgun at his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other bodyguards also prepared to draw their guns as Alexander exerted immense pressure on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked as his fingers wrapped around his Lightsaber's hilt for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't gotten a chance to try it out during his journey here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp hiss, the blade burst to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gasped as it blazed before them, crackling with streaks of gold and silver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man trembled, instinctively drawing his gun on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other seven bodyguards also drew their guns, ready to fire at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the dark muzzles, Alexander swiftly swung his Lightsaber.</span></p></div>
