        <h1>Chapter 1164 Dance Machine</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bar was pumping during prime time, packed with the usual night crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The music thumped through the speakers while strobe lights swept across the dance floor. Couples filled the space, their bodies moving to the beat, burning off that extra energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place has such a great vibe," Ava whispered excitedly in Alexander's ear, pressing close to be heard over the music. "Let's grab some drinks and really let loose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't remember the last time she'd gone out like this, and being here with Alexander had her heart racing a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to dance?" She tugged at Alexander's arm, already swaying to the rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not really much of a dancer." Alexander hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it. I'll show you the moves." Ava couldn't help feeling a little smug. "Nice to know there's actually something you're not perfect at."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd had a few drinks by then, and the alcohol had them both feeling pretty good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Ava's guidance, Alexander started to loosen up, letting his body flow with the music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Advanced Warrior, his physical coordination and musical instincts were off the charts. He picked up the moves instantly like he'd been dancing his whole life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander started pulling out moves he'd only ever seen in movies and music videos, his enhanced abilities letting him recreate them perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he was flowing between different styles</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>breakdancing, pop-and-lock, jazz</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>making it all look effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's moves got smoother and smoother until he was completely in the zone, shocking not just Ava but everyone around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in awe, instinctively making space for Alexander to show off his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They cheered wildly, thrilled to discover such an amazing dancer in their midst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Alexander had the whole bar hyped up. People gathered around him, following his lead and matching his moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women started taking notice too. Several of them tried dancing up on him, making some pretty bold moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Ava right there, they quickly backed off, feeling way out of their league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander was stealing the show, Ava was turning plenty of heads herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her off-shoulder bodycon dress, she moved perfectly to the beat. Her curves were absolutely stunning, drawing hungry stares from guys all around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people hitting up bars like this were looking for some action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman like Ava</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>drop-dead gorgeous with that ice-queen vibe</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>was exactly what these guys were hoping to find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, she's something else. Never thought I'd see a goddess like that in here," muttered a good-looking young guy nearby. He couldn't take his eyes off Ava, looking </span><span>like he wanted nothing more than to grab her and make out right there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, this is your family's bar. Girls are always trying to get with you. She'll be no different</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>one move from you, and she'll be all yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, sir. With your money and those looks, getting her in bed will be a piece of cake," the bartenders chimed in, laying the flattery on thick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy chuckled, "How many times do I have to tell you guys? Watch what you say. This place belongs to Ultimate Alliance. My dad's just the manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Ultimate Alliance or my dad heard what you guys just said, I'd be in for one hell of a beating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was playing modest and setting the record straight, but really, he was just flexing his connections. One could tell he was eating up that superior vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Ava's mesmerizing dance moves, the guy couldn't hold back anymore. He pushed his way through the crowd, heading straight for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander's dancing had the whole bar going wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava couldn't stop grinning. She never would've guessed Alexander could dance like this</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>he was absolutely killing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she felt someone grinding against her from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned for a moment but quickly brushed it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a packed bar, after all, with everyone drinking and dancing. A little physical contact was pretty normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something was immediately off. A hand was groping and squeezing her butt, trying to slip between her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off!" Ava roared, spinning around and landing a solid kick straight into the guy's gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Agh</span><span>!" The man took the full force of the blow, doubling over and clutching his stomach in agony.</span></p></div>
