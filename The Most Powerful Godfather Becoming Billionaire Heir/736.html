        <h1>Chapter 736 She Is Arrogant</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Are you Dr. Bell? Nice to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy was quite surprised as Elaine was just too young, only thirty years old at the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin also glanced carefully at Elaine, who was indeed young, and the skin on her face was delicate and smooth to see through the shields, even better than that of a young girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine didn't pay attention to Eddy and instead said with extreme indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation is urgent now, so we don't need to talk nonsense. Introduce the current situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her attitude was extremely poor with a commanding tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin frowned, not expecting Elaine to be so arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Elaine was not only a Nobel Prize winner in Medicine, but she was a globally renowned medical expert. Also, She had made notable contributions to the field of epidemiology, so of course she seemed arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truly talented people were always high and mighty, and they only hoped that Elaine would be able to save the day and destroy the plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy suppressed the displeasure in her mind, still keeping her smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Bell, as you can see, in the whole Loscity including all the hospitals are paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mortality rate for plague is currently ninety percent. Upon initial modeling estimates, more than half of the people in all of Loscity were infected, and the proportion was rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, the vast majority are in the early stages of infection, so there's still hope we can cure them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine suddenly sneered, "Well, is that all you know? Is that all you know how to how to brag?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm now wondering if you're fit to be the dean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those cold words were like a sharp machete stabbing into Eddy's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddy looked angry and didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it turns out that the only medical standard Loscity has is this, what a disappointment. No wonder such a serious plague broke out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine mocked the Loscity as a whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who didn't know thought that she was naturally arrogant and looked down on people, or because she had a discriminatory attitude towards Eddy or Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson and those dozens of medical experts all felt that Elaine went too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors, nurses and patients next to her had an even worse impression of Elaine, and this woman was just too arrogant, not taking the others into consideration at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was deadly silent, and the atmosphere was quite awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin took a deep breath, suppressed the anger in her mind, and said, "Cut the crap. If you have the ability, come with me and go to the anatomy room, I hope you can help us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took Eddy by the hand and headed inside the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine snorted contemptuously and followed in her heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiggled her ass around, her sexy body catching the eyes of all the males.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson and the others looked at each other with complicated smiles as the people from Risun were really hard to get along with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if they wanted to destroy the plague, Elaine was everyone's hope and could not be offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson didn't say anything and led the crowd to follow closely...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a white BMW 7-series sped up towards Loscity Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia drove while Alexander sat in the back seat of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the doomsday-like scenes along the streets and felt quite lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was born and grew up in Loscity, so of course he didn't want to see Loscity being destroyed by the plague just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had seen many people die, he could not accept Loscity in such a depressed and terrifying state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole city was like a dying patient ready to be put in a coffin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Poison! Damn the City of Sorcery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander became extremely furious as he vowed to destroy the City of Sorcery to avenge these dead people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been relaxed and cheerful because he had the antidote, but when he saw the sick and dying people, he felt upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne," Rosalia hurriedly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but glance at the rearview mirror. Seeing Alexander with a particularly serious expression, she also felt sorry inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia had confidence in Alexander, but this plague was just horrible.</span></p></div>
