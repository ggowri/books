        <h1>Chapter 1223 Roadblock</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a slight nod. "If you're telling the truth, I might consider letting you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, sir. Thank you for your mercy." Kylian bowed repeatedly, his forehead touching the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You get to keep your life," Alexander said coolly, "but I can't have you running around telling tales."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Kylian could react, Alexander pressed his palm against his forehead. Horror filled Kylian's eyes as he felt the Force seep into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow didn't kill Kylian. It just wiped out his recent memories. When he'd wake up later, he wouldn't remember a thing about what went down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kylian's vision went black, and he crumpled to the floor like a rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered his men to drag Kylian out of there, then went back to searching the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a beeline for Fernando's bedroom, figuring that's where he would keep his most valuable stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Quentin came rushing in; all worked up after hearing Alexander had squeezed a security code out of Fernando's assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to find Fernando's secret room," Quentin blurted out, barely containing his excitement. "That's got to be where he's stashing the pure Immortality Serum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Alexander reached Fernando's bedroom door, he found Jonah waiting for </span><span>him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah was standing there like some kind of human roadblock; arms spread wide across the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped dead in his tracks. The two men locked eyes, and one could practically see the sparks flying between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way," Alexander growled, his voice cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that we've taken over the base," Jonah sneered, "it's time we settled our little score."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm looking for the pure Immortality Serum. Get out of my way, or you won't like what happens next." Alexander's patience was wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh really?" Jonah's laugh echoed through the hall. "You're threatening me? Let's see who ends up regretting this little encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know the pure Immortality Serum is in Fernando's room, and I'm not about to let you steal my glory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah's arrogance was practically radiating off him as he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona frowned from the back of the group, wanting to step in. But with Jonah being so aggressive and Quentin staying silent, she swallowed her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin knew these two would have to settle their score one way or another, so he chose to stay out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just like Gael, Jonah&mdash;all talk, no bite," Alexander said with a dismissive smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That lit Jonah's fuse. "You think </span><span>you're</span><span> hot stuff, Alexander? Then shut up and prove it! Let's go right now. We'll see who's all talk!" His body tensed, ready to strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're digging your own grave, Jonah." Alexander's eyes narrowed to slits, a deadly glint flashing behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona stepped forward hesitantly, trying to play peacemaker. "Look, maybe we can all take a step back here. There's no point in holding onto old grudges. It never ends well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth, Ilona," Jonah snapped. "The only way is with Alexander on his knees begging for forgiveness. Otherwise, no deal." He stormed toward Alexander, his face twisted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get the hell away from me," Alexander growled, swinging his arm to deliver a hard slap to Jonah's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare try to slap me? You've got some nerve." Jonah's fury exploded. Slapping someone's face was the ultimate insult. Alexander going straight for a face slap just made his blood boil even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah was a level four metahuman with both super speed and special abilities. When those powers combined, they packed way more punch than one would expect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His combat skills could even rival a level-five metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Jonah's mind, he was just one small step away from officially reaching level five, and when that happened, he'd be throwing down with the level six crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> slap you into next week!" Jonah roared, swinging right back at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hands collided with such force that it sent out a shock wave, the energy blast </span><span>forcing everyone to scramble backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ilona, Quentin, and the others practically jumped out of their skin as they retreated, not wanting to get caught in the crossfire between these two powerhouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dust settled, Alexander hadn't budged an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah, on the other hand, wasn't nearly as cool about it. He stumbled back several steps, glaring at Alexander with murder in his eyes. But instead of getting angry, a grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're as tough as they say," Jonah said, looking genuinely pleased. It had been ages since he'd found someone who could push him back like that.</span></p></div>
