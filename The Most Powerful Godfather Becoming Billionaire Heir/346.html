        <h1>Chapter 346 His Ruthlessness</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's body was tense, and he felt the Force surging wildly through him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lot of the Force passed down by James was refined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was still a Novice Warrior, if this continued, one day, he would truly </span><span>obtain all the Force from James and be promoted to an Intermediate Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Madelyn was still lying on Alexander, too timid to look up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was ashamed, happy, and excited that she had seduced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pleasure she had just experienced made her feel as if she were in heaven. All the pores in her body opened, and she was extremely refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said apologetically, "I'm sorry. Alexander, it's my fault. I know you have a girlfriend, but I couldn't help myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "You can't be so cruel to dump me after sleeping with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn's face immediately blushed scarlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I won't do that. As long as you don't dislike me, I'm willing to be with you," she sighed deeply, hugging Alexander tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experiencing the incomparable orgasm just now, Madelyn realized that she could no longer leave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew what she was thinking. He patted her buttocks and chuckled, "Do you work out regularly? Your butt feels so good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn grabbed Alexander's penis and rubbed it. To her surprise, he immediately had an erection. She shivered with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I am sorry. Let's make love another time. I can't stand it now. I feel my vagina is swollen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned triumphantly with a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, sirens were heard from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn quickly got out of Alexander's arms and shyly wrapped her arms around her chest, but she couldn't hide her naked, sexy body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took off his clothes to cover her and walked outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of their disheveled looks, Quentin immediately asked someone to bring clothes over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, someone dragged Caleb's body over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin waved his hand fiercely. "Throw it into the sea!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he asked Alexander, "Caleb is dead. How should we deal with Marcos?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly, "My opinion remains the same. A living enemy will one day take his revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were shocked by his ruthlessness. He actually wanted to kill Marcos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Quentin had a better impression of Alexander. A man who could do great things would never have any so-called mercy but must be decisive and nip all threats in the bud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately beckoned his men over and ordered them to eliminate Marcos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending Madelyn back to the hotel, Alexander meditated in his room to consolidate the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trip to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> was over, but he still had to go to Treasure Island to see how Cloe was doing recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Brittany came to the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked embarrassedly, "Grandpa, if you want me to ask Alexander out, will he </span><span>look down on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well prepared, with a pretty face, and was wearing a black leather dress, silk stockings, and shiny high heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leather dress was tightly wrapped around her curvy, voluptuous body, revealing her full breasts and adding to her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin sized her up, beaming with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done. All men like sexy beauties, and Alexander is definitely no exception."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, don't talk nonsense. Men will disdain women who are too coquettish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blushed and felt embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin said seriously, "Alexander's master is a Warrior. The military will soon send someone to meet him. He is promising."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are there really any Warriors? Is Alexander a Warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany immediately became interested, thrilled, and delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been a fan of Star Wars since childhood, and she particularly admired the Warriors for their possession of the Force, which made them act like supermen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin knew what she worshiped and smiled bitterly, "Don't get the wrong idea. Alexander is probably just James' pupil, not a true Warrior."</span></p></div>
