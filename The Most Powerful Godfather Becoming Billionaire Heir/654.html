        <h1>Chapter 654 Get Ready</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought this was a catastrophe, but unexpectedly a savior suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the ability that Alexander just demonstrated, he could kill the other side's boss, even if not all the bosses of all the alliance forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Paxton was killed, without the leader of the mafia, other forces would not be able to unite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the Axe would be able to take the opportunity to sweep across Mandale Town and gain the greatest benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa saluted Alexander respectfully and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, everyone in the Axe is willing to obey your command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other leaders shuddered when they saw Alyssa being so humble. They quickly followed Alyssa in bowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted in unison, "I am willing to follow Mr. Hawthorne's command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loud voice was full of energy and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and asked, "Do you have any information? When will Paxton and the others take action?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the intelligence sent back by the undercover agent, Paxton plans to take action the day after tomorrow. This is the time when a new batch of gemstones will be transported back from the mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But our undercover agent has been discovered and is in great danger, so we cannot confirm when Paxton will launch the attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and said nonchalantly, "It doesn't matter. Even if they take action in advance, they won't be able to cause any trouble with me here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare the information I want. I'll choose a target and start the action tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa became excited, and she quickly ordered her men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all deaf? Hurry up and bring all the information about Paxton, the Weaver family, Southern Mining, and the Glory Association to Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her subordinates immediately began to prepare the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe would get rid of the danger and have the hope of unifying Mandale Town. Everyone was excited and more motivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the senior officials immediately gather people and prepare for the attack, waiting for Alexander's order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a thick stack of information was delivered to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat on the sofa with his legs crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa sat obediently beside Alexander, using a fruit knife to peel fruit for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether intentionally or unintentionally, her calves rubbed against Alexander's legs from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned and looked at her with a playful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew very well what Alyssa was thinking. She obviously wanted to establish a closer relationship with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alyssa stood up from the sofa, and as if she had lost her balance, she suddenly fell on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plump and charming breasts pressed against Alexander's chest. They were soft and elastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her slim waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa's miniskirt had been pulled down to her thighs, exposing her plump and round buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Alexander had no improper thoughts about Alyssa, and they were just in a cooperative relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alyssa didn't think so. She panted and accidentally pressed her hand on Alexander's crotch, kneading it skillfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I like strong men like you. I tried to restrain myself, but I can't help liking you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa straddled Alexander openly, hugged Alexander's face, and pressed it against her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Alexander couldn't help it anymore and started to knead her round buttocks, but he didn't touch her panties. After his hand went deeper, he found she was wearing a thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled the thong hard, and the thin piece of fabric was lifted and fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa screamed, and her body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smelled his fingers. His penis became even more swollen and uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa couldn't wait to take it out. His penis stood before her eyes, and its warmth could drive a woman crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa's desire, which had been suppressed for too long, was aroused at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't wait to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please, help me. Ah! Please help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the beautiful woman asked for help, Alexander certainly couldn't refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moans that came one after another soon filled the entire conference room, and Alyssa felt like she was flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had no intention of stopping.</span></p></div>
