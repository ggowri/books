        <h1>Chapter 510 The Guard</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Felix arrived at the restaurant as scheduled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a brand-new designer suit, a gleaming gold Herm&egrave;s belt, and polished black shoes, carrying a heavy briefcase in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, just a little token of thanks for dispatching your troops to protect our headquarters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled as he opened the briefcase, revealing it packed with crisp dollar bills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis responded with a cold smile, "No need for thanks. The Red Umbrella Group is an important partner of the military. It's our duty. If there's anything else you need, just ask!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's eye twitched slightly. He was just baiting him to make requests to take advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, come, have a seat," Francis gestured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stern man immediately picked up a wine bottle, pouring a glass for Francis and Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cheers, to a fruitful partnership!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis raised his glass with a sly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said nothing, clinking his glass in a sullen toast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drank leisurely, like old friends at a casual gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But underneath, each was scheming how to persuade the other and get what they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Francis spoke again, a glint of menace in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, we've always had a good relationship, so let's be frank. You want me to deploy troops to protect the Red Umbrella Group and team up against Alexander, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix agreed immediately, springing up from the couch, visibly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander killed so many of my men. And that bounty is definitely his doing. It's either him or me... I will definitely get revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis just gave a disdainful laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Revenge? How would you manage that? Even those two old-timers, Quentin and Theodore, called me to advise you to apologize, pay compensation, and help restore Alexander's daughter's health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, Alexander is an important military partner and holds an official rank of Colonel. Quentin and Theodore are watching us. I won't personally go against him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face darkened as he replied, "Apologizing and paying up is out of the question. I'll never apologize, and I sure won't help that brat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his hands pressed firmly on the table, he stared unblinking at Francis, speaking with utter resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, if you can send troops to protect my people, then I'll have no worries. I </span><span>can take out Alexander and seize all his product formulas!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's gaze flickered with a strange light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now a level-three metahuman, he couldn't resist using his hypnotic power on Francis, trying to influence his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you! Felix, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, who had been watching Felix, shouted in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a fellow level-three metahuman, he could sense even the slightest energy shift, immediately detecting Felix's power aimed at Francis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw a powerful punch, his fist the size of a boulder, shooting toward Felix's head like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch was so fast it tore through the air, even making a booming thunder sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A level-three power-type metahuman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was startled, instantly regretting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd hoped to use hypnosis on Francis to get what he wanted, but hadn't expected Francis' guard to be a level-three metahuman, stronger than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Felix was about to clash with the man... "Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis' furious shout stopped them both in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis shot Felix a cold glare, then waved for the man to step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, you're far too brave, daring to use powers on me? Do you think the Red Umbrella Group can match the strength of the military?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis' expression had turned hostile, as if he might strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix cautiously stepped back a couple of paces, looking visibly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never would have guessed that Francis would have a level-three metahuman guard by his side.</span></p></div>
