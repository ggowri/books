        <h1>Chapter 594 Fruits</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you don't want me to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and placed his hand on Rosalia's breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you do however you want to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia groaned. Her expression full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held her breast. Rosalia's breathing immediately became rapid. She touched Alexander with a red face, skillfully and expertly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Ah! I found that you have grown up again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia widened her eyes in shock. And her heartbeat involuntarily quickened as she felt the size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia hugged Alexander tightly and pressed his face hard against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed Rosalia directly onto the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's breasts swung. And with her crowing, Alexander went crazy...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was more than an hour before Alexander was satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was lying there panting, not wanting to move. She had no power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Master, you are so powerful... I'm so tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, of course I like it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia struggled to get up and obediently helped Alexander clean his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her sucking without any disgust, Alexander felt a sense of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Rosalia was standing guard at the door. Alexander couldn't help but sigh what a dedicated and responsible woman she is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat and began to meditate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another night had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a long breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his eyes. They were gleaming with brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Force had improved rapidly recently. And he had almost digested and absorbed </span><span>the Force passed down to him by James. Alexander was finally about to become an Advanced Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he met James, James was only an Intermediate Warrior, and his strength must have been affected by his old injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' true strength was definitely that of an Advanced Warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, James was all alone. If he could be surrounded by beautiful women like Alexander to enhance his Force, James would not stop making progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander had only met level-three metahumans, he had a vague feeling that metahumans would eventually experience a major outbreak, so he should improve his strength as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to continue forging the second-level lightsaber. But unfortunately, in order to save Ashley, he </span><span>have</span><span> no time to look for the best gems recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After killing Felix, Alexander needed to find all the gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, there was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened the door and saw that it was Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Nancy, good morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy smiled sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "My dad asked me to send you some fruits. They are so sweet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carried a bag of fruits and showed them to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander invited Nancy in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I was sweating a lot while picking fruits just now. Can I take a shower here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy asked, blushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. He had now become popular among the beauties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Yes, I'll give you a massage later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy blushed. She nodded shyly, then ran into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought of the erotic scenes with Nancy and became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Nancy's family must want Nancy to maintain the relationship with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she would not come so early in the morning with such eager eyes to deliver fruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a normal man, and he could enhance his force with that, so he couldn't refuse her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy washed the sweat stains off her body and thought about what her elders had said last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is kind, capable, and rich. You shouldn't let him go. Even if you can't marry him, being his mistress would be nice, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those powerful people all have a beautiful mistress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scenes flashed through Nancy's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt hot all over and thought, "Am I really going to be Alexander's mistress?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was grateful to Alexander and liked him. But she, like every other woman, had a beautiful love dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could marry Alexander, she would be happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were many beauties around Alexander, he was fond of Ava. And no one could change Alexander's love for Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't I just snatch him away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking, Nancy involuntarily placed her hand on her chest.</span></p></div>
