        <h1>Chapter 1 Godfather</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Champagne-soaked chatter filled the grand ballroom.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The cream of society had turned out in force to celebrate the engagement of Jane Fairfax - Alexander Hawthorne&#x27;s wife - to Ryan Hawkins, heir to the Hawkins empire.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander watched the scene unfold, white-knuckling their marriage certificate as rage boiled in his chest. Then he snapped.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jane!&quot; His voice cut through the crowd. &quot;You&#x27;re my wife! What the hell is this engagement bullshit?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Fairfax clan soon descended on him like wolves, all shoves and snarls, trying to kick him out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Look who crashed the party - waving some paper, claiming he&#x27;s Jane&#x27;s husband,&quot; one sneered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Know your place, trash,&quot; another spat. &quot;You? Marry Ms. Fairfax? In your dreams, loser!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How dare you say such nonsense? Fuck off!&quot; someone else shouted.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander had married into the Fairfax family years ago - no ceremony, no announcement. The social gap was too wide; they couldn&#x27;t risk their precious reputation. They&#x27;d kept it secret all along.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now with Ryan Hawkins in the picture, they saw their golden ticket. No way they&#x27;d let Alexander derail this gravy train.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They were set on ending this ridiculous marriage and kissing up to Ryan.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander stood there shaking, that marriage certificate his only anchor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jane just watched, her face a mask of ice and disgust.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thinking of their daughter fighting for life in the hospital, Alexander swallowed his pride.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Jane, I get it - you&#x27;re doing this for Ashley,&quot; he pleaded. &quot;She needs that treatment money. But I&#x27;ll find a way. You don&#x27;t have to do this...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ha! That&#x27;s adorable!&quot; Ryan&#x27;s laugh cut like glass as he snatched the certificate and shredded it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then he pulled Jane close, smirking. &quot;Here&#x27;s the truth, buddy - Jane&#x27;s been my girl for ages. Every. Single. Inch.&quot; His grin was pure venom.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander felt the floor drop out from under him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Fear flickered across Jane&#x27;s face before ice claimed it again. &quot;Just sign the divorce papers,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;Don&#x27;t flatter yourself, Alexander. Mr. Hawkins will handle Ashley&#x27;s bills. You wouldn&#x27;t want anything... unfortunate to happen to her, right?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s world crumbled. In his eyes, nothing remained but raw despair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He met Jane&#x27;s gaze, jaw tight enough to crack. &quot;Why are you doing this? Five years. I&#x27;ve been your family&#x27;s damn dog for five years, jumping through every hoop. Whatever you wanted, I did it. And this is how you repay me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Jane smirked, face pure contempt. &quot;Why? Because you&#x27;re nothing. A nobody. How could you ever measure up to Mr. Hawkins?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She pressed closer to Ryan&#x27;s side. &quot;He&#x27;s the Hawkins heir. God, I must&#x27;ve been desperate when I married you. At least I wised up now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The mockery in her eyes was like acid.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander broke, tears cutting tracks down his face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Five years, Jane. Ashley&#x27;s four now. I killed myself working to give you both everything.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His voice shattered. &quot;Massaged your shoulders when you were tired. Cooked whatever you wanted, whenever. Starved myself for a month to buy that Chanel bag. And when you said you loved to travel—&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Just shut up!&quot; Jane snapped. &quot;If you were so great, where&#x27;s my better life? Huh?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You got fired because you&#x27;re worthless. Can&#x27;t even pay for Ashley&#x27;s surgery. Five years of chances, and what did you do? Jack shit!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Once a loser, always a loser. You don&#x27;t deserve someone like me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She turned to Ryan, sugar-sweet. &quot;Ryan&#x27;s different. He&#x27;s the sole heir to the Hawkins billions. And he&#x27;s connected to the Saint Group.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her smile turned razor-sharp. &quot;You know the Saint Group, right? One word and the city bows. But,&quot; she laughed, &quot;that&#x27;s way above your pay grade.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Go sign the papers. We&#x27;ll cover Ashley&#x27;s bills, and Ryan might even throw you a bone - career-wise. Don&#x27;t waste your one shot at not being pathetic.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ryan scoffed. &quot;Why bother? Whether he agrees or not doesn&#x27;t matter. He&#x27;ll cave eventually.&quot; He waved lazily. &quot;Someone! Get this trash out of my party.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Several security guards quickly grabbed Alexander by the arms and dragged him toward the exit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He fought back hard until a fist found his gut. The world tilted sideways as pain exploded through his skull, his vision swimming in and out of focus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everything blurred into a nightmare carousel of sneering faces and vicious words, the Fairfax family&#x27;s accusations hitting him like physical blows.</p><p style="text-align:left;">An hour later, Alexander limped back to the hospital, every step pure agony.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With Ashley needing critical care and Jane&#x27;s betrayal still burning fresh, he stood outside Ashley&#x27;s room, completely broken. His hand trembled at the door, but he couldn&#x27;t bring himself to push it open. He couldn&#x27;t bear to face the hope in her eyes...</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, the roar of helicopters shattered the silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone&#x27;s heads whipped up as a fleet of black choppers descended like birds of prey, casting ominous shadows across the hospital grounds. They touched down in perfect formation, their downdraft creating a mini-storm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A small army of men in tactical black suits emerged, moving with lethal grace. They radiated pure danger - the kind that made civilians dive for cover without being told twice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander watched with bitter envy.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><em>Some hotshot bigwig is throwing their weight around.</em></p><p style="text-align:left;"><em>If I had that kind of juice...</em></p><p style="text-align:left;"><em>Jane and Ryan would be fucking roaches under my boot—just waiting to get squashed.</em></p><p style="text-align:left;">To his surprise, those men marched forward and surrounded him, dropping to one knee in perfect sync.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;By order of the Godfather,&quot; they thundered as one, &quot;we&#x27;re here to take you home.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Welcome back, Mr. Hawthorne!&quot;</p></div>
