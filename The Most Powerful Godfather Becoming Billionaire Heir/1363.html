        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted with deafening cheers, "Braylon! Braylon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and the others suddenly realized that he was the odds-on competitor in the silver medal group, likely a perfect level-four warrior. No wonder he was so formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the stand, Huxley nodded approvingly, saying, "Braylon is impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan glanced at Hogan on the bronze medal stage and remarked, "Hogan is also a martial arts prodigy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde stood nearby with a blank expression, feeling utterly lost. She wondered if Alexander had seen her and where he might be now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't shake the thought of when and where they might meet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde had spent over 10 years in the palace, and her feelings had only grown stronger once she fell in love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, something unusual happened on the silver medal stage. A silver figure shot onto the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to be around 20 years old, adorned with a jade crown, sporting a handsome face, and dressed in a silver silk shirt. He held a silver sword, exuding an overwhelming sword intent, as if he were a legendary blade incarnate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience erupted in cheers, chanting, "Rhodes! Rhodes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhodes! You're so handsome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a charming man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan watched the enthusiastic girls go wild and muttered angrily, "What a boy toy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled to himself, recognizing Rhodes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man from the Ministry of Revenue shouted frantically, "Bet now! The seeded players from the silver medal group are competing! Place your bets quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Braylon stood on stage with a serious expression, gripping his Gilded Hammer tightly as he said, "Rhodes, you really know how to play to your strengths!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes, with an icy demeanor, retorted, "If you're scared, just step down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a chill in his heart as he sensed the powerful auras emanating from both fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan gasped, "Wow, their combat effectiveness has surged! It's over 1,800!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes's expression turned fierce as he suddenly shouted, "Dragon Sword!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver sword in his hand gleamed with a blinding white light, and the sword energy emanated like a peacock fanning its tail, enveloping Braylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Braylon shouted back, and the Gilded Hammer in his hands transformed into a multitude of hammer shadows, roaring with the sound of wind and thunder as they hurtled toward Rhodes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift movement, Rhodes arched his body and appeared behind Braylon, launching a massive silver sword blossom toward his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Braylon planted his foot firmly, and with a resounding bang, the entire arena trembled as vibrant light illuminated the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Visible golden ripples surged toward Rhodes from beneath Braylon's feet. It was as if he had eyes in the back of his head. He twisted and turned, launching both hammers at Rhodes's chest in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden ripples destabilized Rhodes, and Braylon's hammer shadow was closing in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Rhodes exhaled sharply, lightly tapping the ground with his toes and leaping several feet into the air, merging body and sword into one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver light of the Dragon Sword in his hand suddenly extended by three feet, aiming for Braylon's head, enveloping him in a chilling, sharp sword intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the impending threat, Braylon called out, "Sword intent! You've grasped the true essence of martial arts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Braylon swung the Gilded Hammer, transforming it into two radiant orbs of golden light, and brought it crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enoch shouted from the audience, "He's realized the true essence of martial arts! The sword he wields has attained sword intent; he's just a step away from becoming a level-five martial artist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander clenched his fists, contemplating the implications. Comprehending the true essence of martial arts, returning to nature, gathering original force into a pill, achieving a diamond body&mdash;Rhodes was growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Combat power: 1900... 2300... 2400..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan seemed to choke on his words, opening his mouth but unable to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the stage, Braylon displayed immense power, while Rhodes stood like a sword immortal, radiating a sinister energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena was awash in blinding silver light entwined with dazzling golden light, dancing in unison yet eerily silent, without the sound of clashing weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Rhodes on the stage shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Rhodes shouted, unleashing a brilliant silver light that resembled a massive, luminescent moon, as a chilling sword intent surged forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden sphere shattered instantly, sending Braylon flying out of the ring, blood spraying everywhere. Braylon was defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The audience erupted into a chaotic mix of cheers and curses.</span></p></div>
