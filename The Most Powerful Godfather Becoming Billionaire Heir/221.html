        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oops!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's expression changed drastically and he retreated quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scornful snort sounded behind him. Kevin didn't know when Alexander was behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander took action at this time, Kevin would be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander did not move but just looked at Kevin arrogantly as if he were looking at an ant on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You son of a bitch, how dare you play tricks on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was furious and punched Alexander hard in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reacted quickly and grabbed his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin felt a sharp pain and immediately struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Kevin used all his strength, Alexander's hand remained motionless. Kevin felt like being clamped by an iron hoop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the scene was completely silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden and Angelica were both confused and didn't know what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, kick him in the lower body and make him infertile!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's head and face were covered in cold sweat. Not to mention kicking Alexander, he couldn't even move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he struggled hard to break free, he would at least have his hand broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you want to cripple my hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed a sarcastic expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin gritted his teeth and shouted angrily, "You only have a slight advantage, don't be complacent..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung his left hand desperately and poked Alexander's eyes hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was really angry. Kevin was becoming more and more vicious each time. Alexander couldn't let Kevin go easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crisp sound, Kevin's right hand twisted into a strange shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin covered his hands and let out a shrill scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his hands was broken, and his fighting skills were completely ruined. He never expected that Alexander was so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on, weren't you arrogant just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin looked at Alexander's brilliant smile, and fear overwhelmed him like a surging </span><span>wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was definitely a ruthless killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was completely panicked. He covered his broken hand and slowly backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, don't be afraid. Beat him to death and break both of his legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was still shouting desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Kevin heard Angelica yelling, he really wanted to kick her to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you going to disable me? Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Kevin with a playful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's whole body was soaked with cold sweat. He smiled bitterly and said, "It's a misunderstanding. I admit defeat..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Admit defeat? I don't agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped Kevin on the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His move seemed light, but in Kevin's eyes it was like lightning and Kevin was completely unable to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a loud sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin flew up and fell heavily off the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat out a large mouthful of blood and fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was deathly silence at the scene, and then there was a burst of cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lost! He lost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden looked at this scene in disbelief, his heart aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, how are you? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica rushed over and supported Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you beat Kevin like this? I'm going to call the police and put you in jail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Angelica's unreasonable words, Alexander couldn't help but laugh. Both parties had signed the agreement before going on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention getting injured, even if Kevin was beaten to death, he could ask for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia smiled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aiden, you lose! According to the clan rules, from now on, I am the head of the Ulysses family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden's face turned pale and he regretted deeply that he had accepted Julia's challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if he had known this would happen, he should have asked Alexander for help. He really regretted it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Aiden deeply regretted it, he was absolutely unwilling to give up his position as the head of the family and the management rights of Gemstone Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Julia, how can a woman like you be qualified to be the head of the Ulysses family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia was furious and said, "Aiden, do you want to violate the clan rules and regret it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden laughed arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if I violated it? The Kaylon and I signed a contract. I am the head of the family recognized by the Kaylon. If you have the guts, go and seek justice from the </span><span>Kaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the Kaylon supports me, why would I be afraid of you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys are far from defeating me!"</span></p></div>
