        <h1>Chapter 342 Round Him Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's face flushed with excitement. It was an outstanding achievement and a blessing for all mankind to discover a Warrior's pupil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, on behalf of the Northern Command, I formally invite you to become our special military supplier and confer you the rank of colonel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned by Quentin's sudden respect. Originally, the highest rank of a special supplier was major, but now, he was directly commissioned as a colonel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Quentin had his own plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of James' death, he believed that with Alexander in the Northern Command, he would be able to establish a relationship with James and that the standing of the Northern Command would also improve. It was a rare opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not object. Knowing that Felix had close ties with the military, he certainly did not want to be left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the military was the most powerful force. With his current strength, he could protect himself against them, but he couldn't fight against them while ensuring the safety of his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn and Avery were so shocked by the sudden surprise that they hadn't fully come back to their senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawson took the initiative to solve their problems, and then Alexander was suddenly awarded the rank of colonel, which was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The funds have been unfrozen. Thank you, Mr. Myers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn repeatedly expressed her gratitude to Dawson with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "You should thank your boyfriend, not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn blushed, realizing that Dawson had misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin stared at Alexander nervously and only felt relieved when Alexander didn't respond to Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his granddaughter could become Alexander's girlfriend, the Thompson family would definitely be more powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, there was a roar of cars outside the window, followed by a fierce quarrel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen of Caleb's cars arrived, and hundreds of his men surrounded the hotel, full of murderous intent.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! I'll shoot if you come any closer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elite troops brought by Quentin immediately blocked Caleb, and the two sides confronted each other with guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb yelled angrily, "Who are you? I'm Caleb Brooks. I'm going in to look for Alexander. It is none of your business. Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He assumed that these people were security guards from the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter roared, "Whoever dares to take a step forward will be killed immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, both sides pointed their guns at each other, and a fight was on the verge of breaking out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was dumbfounded and furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Guzman disappeared, no one in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> dared to disrespect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he couldn't even enter a hotel. Moreover, these aggressive men exuded a murderous aura. There must be some big shot backing them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter held his gun to Caleb's head, oblivious to the fact that he, too, was being targeted by many people, with an extremely cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing that he was really not afraid of death and would definitely dare to shoot, Caleb couldn't help but feel a chill on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly gave in. "Well, don't get angry. I won't go in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb asked his men to bring a loudspeaker and shouted upstairs, "Alexander, I'm Caleb Brooks. Since you dared to harm my son, stop hiding and get out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have surrounded the hotel. You can't escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin slammed his hand heavily on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's bold to come here. How dare a mere drug lord be so arrogant in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately made a phone call to mobilize more men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this was </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, given his position as commander of the Northern Command and as a four-star general, no one dared to turn him down.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, most of the police and all the SWAT teams were dispatched.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of police cars with sirens blaring surrounded the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, the border guards sent out two companies, armed with heavy weapons and mounted in armored vehicles, to quickly encircle the area.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb received a call from his contact at the police station and suddenly panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't figure out what kind of big shot he had offended that could mobilize the entire city's police force and border guards to round him up.</span></p></div>
