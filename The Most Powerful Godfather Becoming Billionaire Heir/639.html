        <h1>Chapter 639 Dare Not Move</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a gun pointed at him by Ian, Alexander remained unnervingly calm, a contemptuous smile playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so funny? You want to die? I can make that happen right now!" Ian snapped, a vague sense of unease creeping over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandale Town was the largest gem trading hub in Soutaxia. Every day, people died for gems, and violence was a constant presence. The air was thick with grudges and animosities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia wielded significant power in Mandale Town, boasting hundreds of elite members, where murder and robbery were everyday occurrences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Ian's extensive experience, he found it impossible to gauge Alexander's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gun aimed at such close range, Alexander's poise unsettled him. He thought to himself, "Could he be a metahuman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a metahuman with speed abilities could dodge bullets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander shook his head, his eyes filled with disdain and pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can kill me with a gun? Too naive!" he scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current abilities, it would be impossible for Ian to harm him in a face-to-face confrontation with a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even a fully automatic submachine gun would pose a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only possible way to injure Alexander would be a powerful anti-material sniper rifle, and that would only work if Alexander were merely an Intermediate Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were an Advanced Warrior, he could evade even a sniper's sneak attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really not afraid of death?" Ian growled through gritted teeth. With the gun in his hand, he felt confident he wouldn't lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped closer, now aiming directly at Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance had shrunk to about three feet, the muzzle of the gun practically touching Alexander's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian tightened his grip on the trigger, ready to fire with just one last push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just Xavier and Alice, but even the onlookers felt their hearts racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The proximity made it impossible to dodge a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize, or I'll blow your head off!" Ian threatened, his voice dripping with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't tolerate Alexander's confident demeanor and was determined to shatter it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this close range, Ian couldn't believe that Alexander could pull off any tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should be the one apologizing!" Alexander retorted, sneering as he casually waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian froze in shock as the gun suddenly slipped from his grip, now firmly in Alexander's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's speed was astonishing; the barrel was now pointed directly at Ian's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This couldn't be happening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian felt a wave of panic wash over him, his body rigid with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leveled the gun at his head and commanded, "Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... Don't get cocky! So, what if you have a gun? The Mafia runs the show in Mandale Town. Everyone has to listen to us, got it?" Ian's voice quivered as he tried to sound tough, desperately hoping that Alexander would hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men exchanged nervous glances, paralyzed with fear. Deep down, they understood that if Alexander wanted Ian dead, it would be a simple task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally realized that Alexander was a true expert, far beyond their capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked as if he might just pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian swallowed hard several times, his voice shaking as he stammered, "If you kill me, my men will hunt you down. None of you will ever leave Mandale Town alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a hearty laugh, full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Alexander's laughter, Ian felt desperate. His body stiffened, and his lips trembled as he asked, "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Ian's mental defenses had crumbled, and he could no longer maintain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I want? You'll find out soon enough," Alexander replied, a smile still on his face as he pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the sharp crack of gunfire echoed through the air. Ian let out a piercing scream and fell to his knees.</span></p></div>
