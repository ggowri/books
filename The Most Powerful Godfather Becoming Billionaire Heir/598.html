And she was ambitious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Felix saw Megan, a gentle smile immediately appeared on his face. He looked like a considerate and perfect husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Megan, aren't you putting on makeup? I'm just thinking about you. Come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan sat in Felix's arms obediently, hugged his neck and said coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, our wedding day is coming soon. I'm so happy! You must be nice to me in the future. I will make you happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Megan asked for a kiss. She was so cute and beautiful that any man would be captivated by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling, Felix reached his hand into her clothes and kneaded her breast vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Baby, I am touched that you can marry me. The Red Umbrella Group is facing difficulties now. Your family is my greatest help. And you are so kind. I will love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix shed a tear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, you are so kind. If the leader knew about this, he would be very pleased."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan was still a little naive. Seeing Felix being so affectionate, she was actually moved and about to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix kissed and touched Megan, making her gasp, then he said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're getting married today. You'll have so much fun tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, stop that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan shyly lay in Felix's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "For this wedding, all the prominent people in our family will come to attend. This is an unprecedented grand occasion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, so I am very grateful to your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sighed with a happy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been secretly paying attention to the door and heard a faint breathing sound. He sneered inwardly, knowing that Frederick had always arranged people to monitor him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, after we get married, we will stabilize the Red Umbrella Group, and then expand our influence in the Morris family. Maybe we will have a chance to seize the position of the head of the family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Megan could finish her words, Felix slapped her hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Megan, what did you just say? Mr. Frederick Morris is so good to us. How could you betray him? I am so disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare to say such things again, I will report it to Mr. Frederick Morris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix glared at Megan fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, calm down..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan covered her swollen cheek and felt dizzy. The slap was hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said, "Humph! Stop. I won't listen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix waved his hands angrily and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, I don't mean to betray..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan quickly hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said, "Why are you encouraging me to seize the position of the head of the family? I don't want to be in cahoots with you. Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix pushed her away coldly and ruthlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan cried out and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's voice was heard outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick walked in quickly with several senior members of the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix quickly said to Megan, "You said nonsense. I will not agree to your betrayal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he pretended to look at Frederick with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick smiled meaningfully and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, I was right about you. Although you are ambitious, you are kind and grateful. I like young people who have a bright future. Our family is very happy to have you join us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan stood up. It was obvious that the words she had just said were just a test to Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, I promise you that I will make Alexander beg you for mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick patted his chest confidently and made the promise.</span></p></div>
