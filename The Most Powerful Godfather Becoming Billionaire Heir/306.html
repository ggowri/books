        <h1>Chapter 306 The Thought of Revenge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made up his mind. He left some people to guard the captives and swiftly charged toward the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the fight had started, he might as well push forward and crush the enemy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the basement of the villa, Jane and Andrew, along with Belinda and others, were locked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, get out here! I have questions for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder dragged Jane out of her cell, her hands cuffed behind her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she struggled, her ample figure swayed alluringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder </span><span>leered,</span><span> his eyes filled with a lascivious glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stand still; I need to ask you something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp command, Jane was slammed against the wall, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forced to push her chest out, the torn neckline of her dress exposed a deep cleavage that was quite tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inwardly, Jane wished for nothing more than to disappear. She had wanted to climb the ranks with Schroder, only to find herself in this predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret and pain filled her heart as she thought of Alexander's glory. It was truly tragic and ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, this woman has a nice figure&mdash;she's Alexander's ex-wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Schroder's men chimed in, trying to curry favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad at all. Her chest is so fair and large. I bet it could spill over with a squeeze," Schroder said with a twisted grin, reaching out to grab Jane's breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, why are you treating me like this? I'm willing to follow you. Why are you acting this way?" Jane asked, defiant yet desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha </span><span>ha</span><span> ha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder laughed maniacally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, just because you want to follow me doesn't mean you're worthy of it. Women like you are nothing more than streetwalkers to me&mdash;just toys to play with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's disdain and mockery made Jane's blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane spat in Schroder's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, you're asking for death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed Jane against the wall several times, anger radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, if you damage her, you won't be able to enjoy her later. Can we have her once you're done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at those curves. We can hardly resist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please leave her to us, General, so that we can have some fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men nearby begged Schroder, their greedy eyes locked on Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane trembled with rage; even if she was open-minded, she couldn't accept the advances of so many sleazy men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're committing a crime! Let us go, or you'll face a military tribunal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think after I've captured you, I'll be afraid of a military tribunal? Are you insane?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll tire of this woman after a few times; then I'll hand her over to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grab her! I want to check her out... see how she feels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Schroder's command, the men grinned wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away from me! Don't touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane screamed in vain as several burly men pinned her to the wall, rendering her immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her already tattered dress was completely stripped away, exposing her voluptuous body, bare for all to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh wow, a woman who's had kids is different; she's got a bit of a belly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with a bit of a belly, she's got a fat, round ass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They commented on Jane as if she were livestock up for sale, utterly disregarding her dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face flushed with a mix of anger and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see how she feels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder sneered, extending his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loathed Alexander, and though Jane was his ex-wife, the thought of revenge thrilled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her flesh roughly, squeezing painfully, causing Jane to scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get off me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane suddenly kicked out, connecting with Schroder's inner thigh, narrowly missing his groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder jumped back, startled; a kick there could send a man to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, how dare you kick me?" Schroder cursed angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold her hands and feet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was pinned against the wall, completely restrained, forced to watch as Schroder approached with a sinister grin.</span></p></div>
