        <h1>Chapter 668 One at a Time</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bald man shouted through a loudspeaker, launching a psychological offensive, "Alyssa has been killed by us and can't come to save you. </span><span>So</span><span> you'd better surrender. You are surrounded and can't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Axe's morale was low, the bald man suddenly screamed and covered his bloody head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a hole the size of a bowl on his forehead, and he fell straight to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, full of fear, died with his eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An agile figure suddenly appeared, waving his hands and hurling small stones in succession. Each took a life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen Mafia members collapsed, and the others all hid away in fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne is here to save us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe members cheered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley and other senior executives of the Axe were overjoyed. They knew that Alexander had destroyed the Glory Association and Southern Mining on his own. With him around, there was hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, stay at your positions. I'll deal with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander rushed towards the Mafia experts at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of his fearless counterattack, the Axe members opened their eyes wide in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander targeted the Mafia experts, who posed a great threat because they were agile and fully equipped with bulletproof gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were not killed, the Axe would lose its place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. They should be the backbone of the Mafia, and they were now seeking death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a lunatic! He can do nothing on his own. Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mafia members started shouting, raised their guns, and shot at Alexander fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets flew towards him like a rainstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, the Axe members, the Weaver family, and the Mafia members all saw a scene that would remain with them forever.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander seemed to have turned into a wisp of green smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless bullets missed him but hit the afterimages, which were left because of his swift movements. As a result, he avoided all bullets to perfection.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept his eyes fixed on those experts and darted towards them like a tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wizard, who was hiding in the darkness, was quiet and did not move as if he </span><span>feared him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six Mafia experts stared at Alexander intently with wide-open eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was too fast. Before they could react, he appeared in front of one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expert was frightened out of his wits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A white light emerged in Alexander's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lightsabers slashed across the expert's body from foot to head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the expert was dressed in a full set of bulletproof equipment, it couldn't block the Lightsabers at all. Alexander cut his body in half with one move, and blood spurted out like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before everyone could come back to their senses, he wielded the Lightsabers again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp sword light passed through the bodies of the other two experts, cutting them into four pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, half of the six Mafia experts were dead, and blood flowed on the ground like a blooming flower of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other three experts were so scared that they lost their fighting spirit and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander caught up with them and sent them all to hell, one at a time, with the Lightsabers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, there was no sound of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stopped fighting and gazed blankly at the scene and at the figure that looked like the Reaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held the lightsaber in his hand, calm and composed, his deep eyes flashing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura was intimidating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe members were excited, their eyes sparkling. They had experienced countless bloody battles and had always admired the strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander was a man of real power, possessed of formidable abilities, and decisive in the way of killing. People could only respect him and admire him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of relaxing his vigilance, he pivoted around, glanced at a shadow, and said coldly, "Are you a wizard from the City of Sorcery? You'd better get out of here right away and stop seeking death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone stared at the shadow in surprise, but they saw no one.</span></p></div>
