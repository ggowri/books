        <h1>Chapter 1165 Blind Idiots</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you kick me? Do you have any idea who I am?" the man sputtered once he caught his breath, glaring at Ava with pure rage. That kick had been dangerously close to his groin. Any lower and she would have completely ruined him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care who you are. You touched my ass, so you deserved it," Ava shot back, staring him down. She absolutely despised creeps like him. Plus, with Alexander nearby, she wasn't worried about her safety at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that's rich! You're the one who kicked me first, and now you're making up lies about me touching you!" The man let out a harsh laugh. "There are people everywhere. What, did your ass grow eyes? How can you be so sure it was me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy's ridiculous attempt to flip the blame sent laughter rippling through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was absolutely fuming. This guy had some serious nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen here, you little bitch. This whole bar belongs to me," the guy sneered, his words dripping with venom. His embarrassment had clearly turned to rage as he hurled insults at Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava stood her ground, firing right back. "You're nothing but a woman-harassing piece of trash who should've been gone yesterday. What a waste of oxygen. You should be </span><span>ashamed of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their heated exchange was drawing quite the audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly appeared at Ava's side. "What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This creep was getting handsy with me. I kicked him, and now he's throwing a fit about it," Ava spat out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better watch your mouth, bitch," the guy sneered. "Who would want to touch you anyway?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone here knows who I am</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>Preston Lancaster. This bar belongs to my family, and I've got women lining up for me. Why would I waste my time on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep running your mouth with these accusations, and I'll have security throw you both out," Preston threatened, sizing up Alexander with obvious contempt. The smug look on his face showed he thought he had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead meat!" Alexander's voice dripped with ice-cold fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was his woman, and he wouldn't let anyone disrespect her, period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Preston could spit out another insult, a sharp crack split the air. Alexander's palm connected with Preston's face so hard it sent him staggering back several steps, seeing stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, break it up! You got some nerve starting fights in here. Do you have any idea who you just hit? Get him, boys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, several bouncers and waiters from the bar swarmed around Alexander, surrounding him with murderous glares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your problem? Bunch of blind idiots!" Alexander snapped. With lightning speed, he backhanded their leader, sending the guy flying. The man crashed to the floor and lay there motionless, clearly knocked out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the crew froze, suddenly realizing they were way out of their league with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You son of a bitch!" Preston cursed, nursing his stinging cheek. "You really think you can pull this crap here? This is Ultimate Alliance territory. They're the biggest force in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. You're so dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped out his phone and made a quick call. Within moments, over a dozen beefy thugs came charging out of the bar, surrounding Alexander with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down, all of you! I'll take full responsibility for whatever happens!" Preston's blood was boiling. He wanted nothing more than to destroy Alexander right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" The group roared in unison, charging at Alexander from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, suddenly appearing behind two of the burly men. His fists shot out like lightning, left and right, smashing into their chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent them flying back into the crowd with agonized screams as if they'd been hit by a speeding truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning this was an Ultimate Alliance bar only made Alexander angrier. Even after Betty's internal cleanup, trash like Preston was still causing trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the threat behind him clear, Alexander pulled Ava behind him protectively. Then, he unleashed a spinning kick, sending several attackers flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were incredibly fast. In the blink of an eye, over a dozen muscled thugs lay sprawled on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston's face went ghost-pale. He spun around and tried to bolt back into the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you think you're going?" Alexander swiftly kicked Preston's lower back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston yelped as he tumbled to the ground. As he turned over, Alexander planted his foot firmly on Preston's chest, pulled back his arm, and delivered a brutal slap across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you just talking about taking me down? Why are you running away now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Preston could answer, Alexander's hand whipped across his face again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from Preston's mouth, along with a few broken teeth.</span></p></div>
