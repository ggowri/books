        <h1>Chapter 781 Can't Win</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The important guests who came to the celebration were feeling uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew this celebration wouldn't be peaceful, and they regretted coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was so powerful, and if Alexander really brought his people to fight, there would be a bloody battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They worried they would be caught in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only the guests but also Monica and Rock were anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock looked at Yvonne coldly and asked, "Why are you so fast? Tell the truth, and maybe I'll let you die without too much pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne looked at him with disdain and didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you?" Rock shouted and walked towards Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His steps were steady, and his killing intent was strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone watched in awe, holding their breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock was powerful, and his presence made everyone nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was calm and ready to defend herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't plan to back down, but she looked serious, feeling the pressure from Rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like she was facing a wild beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, do you think that because you serve Alexander, you can be rude to me? Come on, use your strongest witchcraft to attack me," Rock said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stopped at a spot not far from her and looked down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne snorted at his arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was ambitious and strong, and Rock's words were an insult to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Old fool, I don't care if you're a white wizard or a dark wizard. Die!" Yvonne shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lunged at Rock at top speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She threw dozens of poison needles at him. If even a tiny bit of skin was pricked, it would be fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked by her moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now she was even faster than just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Yvonne was facing Rock, a white wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Rock was still a dark wizard, he could block the attacks of Shadow, Charlize, and Rosalia together using the Ancient Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that he was stronger. He wouldn't be easily defeated by Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To everyone's surprise, when the poison needles reached Rock, they were blocked by a black mist and couldn't move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this all you've got?" Rock looked at Yvonne with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne waved her hands quickly, and it looked like she had a thousand hands throwing countless poison needles at Rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were also witchcraft insects mixed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wizards watching were scared. Such a strong attack would be impossible to dodge for any of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica frowned slightly but still looked down on Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock opened the Ancient Grimoire, and a black mist came out, forming a strong shield that blocked all the poison needles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The witchcraft insects that touched the black mist fell to the ground, dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looked like Yvonne was winning, but she couldn't hurt Rock at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm in trouble!" Yvonne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew she had to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had told her to run if she couldn't win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne had overestimated her strength. She was still much weaker than Rock, and Rock hadn't even started his real attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're scared now, aren't you?" Rock laughed wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He flipped the Ancient Grimoire, and the black mist turned into a red light, pulling all the poison needles towards it like a magnet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The needles formed a scary blue ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Break!" Rock pointed at the needles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The red light surrounded the needles, and with a bang, all the needles turned into dust.</span></p></div>
