        <h1>Chapter 624 Get out of Loscity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan was trembling. If he didn't sign, he would die, and if he signed, he would be killed by Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking for a while, he signed his name on the agreement with trembling hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled with satisfaction and touched Olivia's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You are the owner of the exchange now. Ultimate Alliance is only responsible for assisting in management. You will take 70% of all profits, and we will take 30%."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was so excited that tears filled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged Alexander tightly. "Alexander, thank you. I don't want money. Everything I have is yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these words, Betty rolled her eyes at Alexander and pinched his thigh hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "Boss, you are such a playboy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. He hadn't visited Betty since he returned to Loscity yesterday, and she was jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to look at Evan and said coldly, "Get out of here. Tell SATAN, I don't want to see any Mafia members in Loscity, or I'll kill them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan didn't dare to retort and ran away quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mafia members also wanted to leave but were surrounded by members of Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty smiled sweetly and waved her hand. "Catch them all and take them away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people wanted to resist, but facing hundreds of gun muzzles, they could only squat on the ground with their hands on their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, all the Mafia members were taken away, and they would all be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exchange was silent. All the customers had grim expressions and dared not speak for fear of getting into trouble. Ultimate Alliance was the most powerful force in Loscity, and they could not afford to offend it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed. "This matter has nothing to do with you. The exchange is open for business, and everyone is welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and the atmosphere gradually became warmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's amazing. This gentleman must be an expert in treasure hunting. Otherwise, how could he accurately find a top-grade gem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he found a top-grade emerald from a scrap mine. He is amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admire him so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the awe-filled gazes of the crowd, Alexander continued to walk around the ores, hoping to find more top-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not want to miss any opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia followed obediently, looking at Alexander with awe and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect that Alexander could take back the exchange so easily and cut out a piece of top-grade emerald worth hundreds of millions. It was amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Alexander pointed to an inconspicuous black ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at this one. I think it's pretty good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty said doubtfully, "I don't think so. This one is pitch black and doesn't look like it has any gemstones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander used his All-seeing Eyes to observe it again. Although the light inside the ore was not that strong, there was definitely a high-grade gem inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand and said, "Cut this one open."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff in charge of cutting the stone became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't care who was in charge of the exchange, as long as they were not fired and their salaries were paid as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they admired Alexander very much for finding such a large piece of top-grade emerald just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harsh cutting sound rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how cautious they were, Alexander couldn't help but instruct them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut from here. Cut this stone in half and leave the smaller piece on the left, and then use the grinder to grind this part."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They nodded in shock, thinking Alexander was so amazing that he could see what was inside the stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the ore was cut in the middle, and then the small piece on the left was put on the grinder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed by, and suddenly, there was a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is a gem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although it's not a top-grade gem, it's a high-grade ruby. It's amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was young, he was an expert in treasure hunting. He just found a top-grade gem worth hundreds of millions, and now he found a high-grade ruby worth million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said with admiration, "This is amazing. Can he see what's inside the stone? Otherwise, how could he know there is a gem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even he himself couldn't believe this.</span></p></div>
