        <h1>Chapter 1020 Bad News</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at the office, Paula had to continue with her secretary duties. But whenever Josiah wanted her, he would pin her down on the desk and have his way with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For almost half a year, she was played by Josiah, and strangely, she didn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But one day, Josiah's wife caught them in the office with a dozen relatives barged in, breaking the door down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula got a beating, and Josiah was forced to fire her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Josiah had built his company with the help of his wife's family, and he couldn't afford to offend them over a mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula left the company in disgrace, not even receiving her paycheck for the month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josiah tried to contact her afterward, but Paula wanted nothing to do with him and severed all ties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although this chapter of her life wasn't exactly glorious, Paula would never forget it, as Josiah had been her first man after her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula breathed heavily, finishing her tale, unable to control herself any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While she spoke, Keith had been caressing her, his hands sliding from her bust to her smooth thighs, to her round, firm bottom...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula had gone into great detail, even mentioning Josiah's preferences and the ways he made her feel ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Keith could barely contain himself, his anger rising as he could no longer hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith tore open Paula's clothes without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sharp gasp, Paula was thrown onto the couch, her long legs lifted and folded over his strong, firm chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Keith was thrusting into her, moving his hips quickly, violently attacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paula's full and lush body rocked back and forth, and the room was filled with the sounds of ecstasy, growing louder and louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shocking news about Axel and Asher's disappearance in Loscity had made headlines across the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at the front page and grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As expected, the Vance family's upper echelons had already started fighting over wealth and status. No one had come to take revenge on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From this point on, the Vance family's reputation would take a significant blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, here's the construction progress report for Treasure Island and Devil Island," Augusta said respectfully, handing over a document.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved his hand dismissively. "Let Cloe handle it. There's no need for you to report everything to me. But keep an eye on Sakra Society and Yinson's movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That old bastard Yinson, along with the higher-ups at Risun, will definitely continue pushing the Immortality Project in secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne. I'll make sure they're on it!" Augusta responded eagerly and went off to handle the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Ava came out of the room, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's bad news!" Ava said with great concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What bad news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's smile faded as he turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our supply of raw materials for the magic powder is running out, and someone's sabotaging us," Ava said, her voice tinged with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander frowned, a murderous glint flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Nexura Group has been our supplier for years. How could they suddenly run out of stock?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava nodded. "We were about to renew our contract with them, but they said they need to reconsider. Someone must be behind it. Otherwise, they wouldn't refuse to make money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without enough raw materials, sales of the magic powder would take a massive hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Asher's poisoning incident, the reputation of the magic powder had already taken a blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava had planned to ramp up production and launch a major promotional campaign to restore its image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, with the Nexura Group, the empire's largest supplier of pharmaceutical raw materials, suddenly refusing to renew the contract, her plans were in jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Nexura Group controlled half of the nation's pharmaceutical raw material market, and some of their key ingredients were even exclusive to them, making them a giant in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chairman, Malakai Valdez, was not someone to be underestimated. He was wealthy and controlled a significant underground fight business with numerous subordinates at his command.</span></p></div>
