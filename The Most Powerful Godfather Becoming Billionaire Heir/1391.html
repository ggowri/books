        <h1>Chapter 1391 The Staggering Price</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience discussed in shock, "Is it really a divine's relic? No way! Would they be willing to sell it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's useless to buy it. I heard that one needs to reach the Divine Transformation State to be able to use the divine's relic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that only the inner disciples of Dominion Church can have divine's relics. The price of such a treasure must be staggering."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure that if it's really a divine's relic, they won't put it up for auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was shocked when he heard this. He thought, "The divine's relic? Could it be that what's on the fourth floor of Treasure House, which is exclusive for inner disciples, is the divine's relic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sonya, who was beside Alexander, saw his puzzled look and couldn't help but explain, "Sir, the divine's relic has extraordinary power. It is said to be an item from the immortals. However, one must be in the Divine Transformation State to use it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded without saying anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a burly man came onto the stage, holding a delicate white box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those four people appeared, the golden energy started surging. An intense and scorching warm current burst through his body, as if it was about to burst out of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but cover his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sonya panicked and quickly stepped forward to support him. "Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. He looked stern, thinking, "The golden energy is my reliance in this world. It's surging wildly now. There must be a reason. No matter how much the divine's relic costs, I must get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man in black on the stage shouted, "Quiet!" Then, he took the white box, took out a small ring from it, and showed it to the audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All who were present were excellent warriors. They were sharp-eared and keen-eyed, so they could see clearly that it was a small, unremarkable black ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man said slowly, "Everyone, listen to me. This is an unknown ring, neither made of gold nor gem. Its material is unique. Neither water nor fire can damage it. When a person in the Divine Transformation State infuses divine power into it, it can weigh thousands of pounds, yet the user won't feel its weight. The Business Alliance spent a large sum of money to invite a master in the Divine Transformation State to appraise it. It is suspected to be a divine's relic. However, we're not certain now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience started whispering, "I thought it was really a divine's relic. It turns out it's only suspected to be a divine's relic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are a lot of such so-called suspected divine's relics in many auction houses. Well, I'm not saying that this auction is cheating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it has been appraised by a master in the Divine Transformation State, and its material is unique, it might be a treasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's only heavy but not very useful. If the strike of thousands of pounds is real, the impact would be extremely powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man in black heard the whispers and thought, "Humph, if it was really a divine's relic, would it be auctioned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cleared his throat and said, "The starting price of this ring is 100 thousand silver coins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience started bidding, "150 thousand silver coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"200 thousand silver coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"280 thousand silver coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"1.3 million silver coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether this unremarkable ring was a divine's relic or not, it was quickly bid up to a staggering price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly man with a grim expression stood up, gritting his teeth and shouting, "Two million silver coins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't bid yet. He knew the real competition would come at the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far from this burly man, a young woman in a red dress with a veil raised the bid again. "1.5 million silver coins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly man felt that this woman seemed to be targeting him. He was so angry that he clenched his fists tightly, trembling all over in a fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price was already staggering, and other people had already withdrawn the bidding. After all, it was unwise to spend such a large sum of money to buy a suspected divine's relic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly man stared at the woman in the red dress with a resentful look. "I offer 1.6 million coins. Miss, if you continue to increase the price, the suspected divine's relic will be yours." He bid again and laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in the red dress raised an eyebrow, glanced at him disdainfully, and said, "1.61 million silver coins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." The burly man's face turned red, and he was trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman only increased the price by ten thousand silver coins to humiliate him. The man stared at her with venomous eyes for a while and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, no one bid again. The old man in black on the stage was delighted. It was unexpected that the ring could be sold at such a high price. He stroked his beard and smiled, "If no one wants to continue to bid, this divine's relic will belong to this lady!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"1.8 million silver coins!" Just then, a voice came from the second floor, increasing the price by 190 thousand silver coins at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The audience couldn't help but whisper and turn around to look at the second floor, but they could only see the dazzling colorful light of the glass and couldn't see the people inside. There was something special about the transparent glass on the second floor.</span></p></div>
