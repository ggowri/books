        <h1>Chapter 1319 Seize Them</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-clad young man pulled a green pill from his suit pocket and swiftly pushed it into Alexander's mouth. Hearing the elder's blatant lies, he snapped, "How dare you twist the truth? Your Mr. Wetherall was harassing my maid in the middle of the street! These two gentlemen merely stepped in to help out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer looked at Julius. His expensive suit and arrogant demeanor screamed spoiled noble brat. Then, he glanced at the white-clad youth's beautiful maid and the silent crowd, their faces filled with suppressed outrage. He had heard rumors that the marshal's son was infamous for his depravity. Now, seeing it firsthand, he didn't need much convincing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer thought, "But still, Julius's father, Madden, was once the emperor's childhood companion, a warrior who followed the emperor through countless campaigns, securing victory after victory. Now, Madden holds supreme military authority over the entire realm. And I? I'm just a lowly city patrol captain..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer made his decision. He bellowed, "How dare you cause trouble right under the emperor's nose? Seize them!" At his command, the soldiers surged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan squared his stance, ready to fight to the bitter end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as chaos was about to erupt, the white-clade youth shouted, "Enough!" He suddenly stood, pulling a golden token from his suit pocket and tossing it toward the officer. "Open your damn eyes and look carefully!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer caught the token and examined it. The front bore the intricate engraving of a grand, multi-tiered Five Phoenix Tower. A plaque displayed two bold characters at the top, "Meridian Gate." A word was carved deep into the metal on the back, "Eternal." Below it, there was a small but unmistakable script, Thirteenth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer's breath hitched. His hands shook so violently that he nearly dropped the token. Without hesitation, he bowed. "My..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-clad youth waved a hand, cutting him off. "Stop right there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer immediately grasped that the white-clad youth did not wish to reveal his identity. He quickly straightened up and barked, "Arrest these criminals at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" The elderly man was in shock. He sensed that the young man was no ordinary figure. He dared not resist, even as the soldiers bound him with thick sinew cords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darwin was the heart of Hrodvik, a city teeming with powerful figures lurking in the shadows. Despite being a formidable level-three warrior, the elderly man could only hope for the lowly rank of a captain in the military. And now, standing before an actual captain, resisting arrest would be a crime punishable by the execution of his entire clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other servants turned pale. Only the arrogant Julius continued to thrash and howl. "I am the son of Marshal Wetherall! Who dares lay a hand on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the soldiers remained unfazed. Loyalty and obedience had been drilled into their very bones. They tied everyone up without hesitation and began marching them toward the Darwin Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander felt his vision darken. His limbs trembled uncontrollably, and his chest burned with turmoil. He was utterly spent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to lose consciousness, a soft fragrance drifted toward him. Suddenly, he felt himself falling into a warm and soft embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could react, a fragrant pill was slipped between his lips. It melted instantly, spreading a cooling sensation throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even the golden mark within his chest seemed to stir, responding with a powerful surge of warmth. The two opposing forces, one cool and soothing, began to weave through his veins, spreading to every corner of his body. Deep within his core, the Force began to rotate once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-clad youth glanced at Alexander, who had already settled into a meditative state, and smiled faintly. Turning to Logan, he said, "Thank you both! You take good care of him. I have urgent matters to attend to. I have to go now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked away gracefully with her beautiful maid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, that guy walks like he's swaying his hips. What a freak!" Logan shuddered in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the excitement over, the onlookers gradually dispersed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About eight minutes later, Alexander finished his meditation. He slowly opened his eyes and exhaled, feeling completely refreshed. His senses were sharper than ever, and deep within his core, the Force had condensed into a swirling vortex, marking him just a step away from reaching level-two warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander fully recovered, Logan wasted no time embellishing the earlier events, dramatically emphasizing how he had fought off a whole gang single-handedly to protect Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander naturally knew Logan loved to brag. That elderly man was a level-three warrior. Logan wouldn't have stood a chance even if he had a hundred lives. That white-clad youth was a mystery, and the pill he gave Alexander was miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More troubling was that they had now made an enemy of the Grand Marshal. That could spell serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, since Alexander and Logan worked at Dominion Church, even the Grand Marshal wouldn't dare stir up trouble there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan went to a pharmacy, exchanging the Melon King pelt for two hundred coins. The pelt still contained traces of Verdant Crown Melon essence, making it a highly sought-after medicinal ingredient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long day of exploring, eating, and having their fill of excitement, they finally returned to Emerald Manor to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in the study of the Marshal's Mansion, a striking woman in a yellow gown collapsed on the floor, sobbing pitifully before a middle-aged man. "Madden, you must seek justice for me and Julius! That damned Jeffrey Dewey beat Julius so badly his backside is completely bruised!"</span></p></div>
