        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the City of Sorcery, strength was everything. If one was powerful enough, they could become elders, grand elders, and even the city ruler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica became the city ruler by defeating the former one, who was only a dark wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock was cunning and knew he couldn't defeat Monica yet, so he continued to hide his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed that he would get his chance soon and that her position would be his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica saw that Rock was still behaving and nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She started chatting with Rock, while the other wizards and leaders stood by with smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Monica or Rock attacked, they wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne has sent a gift," a voice called from outside the temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked by the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The news dropped a bomb in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the wizards knew that Alexander had killed many from the City of Sorcery and taken the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Rock had almost been defeated by Alexander's followers on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was bold enough to provoke them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wondered if he had come with an army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the wizards were on guard, ready for an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other leaders looked at each other, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't know who Alexander was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But given the expressions of those people from the City of Sorcery, he should be a powerful wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's crazy!" Rock shouted and rushed to the temple door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arrogant fool!" Monica snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never expected Alexander to be so bold as to come to the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today was the city's 100th-anniversary celebration, with hundreds of wizards gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone followed Rock and Monica to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to see what Alexander looked like and why he was so daring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of high heels clicking on the floor grew louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sexy woman in a red robe walked in calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was none other than Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they had announced Alexander's gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica and Rock were confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, what joke are you playing? Don't think you can cause trouble just because you're pretty and know some witchcraft," Monica shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never liked Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were the same kind of people. Yvonne was ambitious and used her looks to gain followers in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she only won over a small group of wizards, Monica couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica had sent Yvonne to Mandale Town, hoping to find a chance to get rid of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne didn't care about Monica's anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Monica, I am here on behalf of Mr. Hawthorne to deliver a gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And to remind you and Rock to wash your necks clean. He will cut off your heads and use them as balls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Monica barked, "Yvonne, are you rebelling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rock also shouted, "Tell Alexander to come out. If he dares, I will make him suffer today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the wizards were shouting angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell Alexander to come out. He's too scared to come himself, so he sends you. Yvonne, are you stupid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne is Alexander's spy. That's why we always lose to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, go down on your knees and beg Ms. Quinn for mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wizards were ready to attack Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had insulted them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some greedy wizards stared at Yvonne, finally seeing their chance to get her.</span></p></div>
