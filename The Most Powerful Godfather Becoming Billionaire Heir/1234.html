        <h1>Chapter 1234 News of Despair</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman returned to her post on the wall and turned to her father with worried eyes. "Dad, what are we going to do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson's face was grim as he replied, "All we can do is pray and hope the authorities find out about our situation soon enough to send help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled his daughter into a tight hug. "</span><span>Norah</span><span>, if things go south, you need to get out of here. I'll make sure someone covers your escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Norah Chapman's beautiful eyes, a couple breaking free to roll down her cheeks despite her best efforts to hold them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much, Mr. Chapman!" The group of survivors chorused their gratitude to Karson, their faces a mix of relief and raw emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did you all come from? What's it like out there?" Norah asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't burned through their precious ammo and risked their necks just out of the kindness of her heart&mdash;she needed intel about how bad the mutant situation had gotten, and these survivors were her best shot at getting accurate information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several of the survivors broke down sobbing, their bodies shaking uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One middle-aged man seemed to keep it together better than the others. He addressed Norah respectfully, his voice steady despite everything he'd been through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're farmers from the west farms," one of them explained. "All our livestock&mdash;the cattle, horses, sheep, chickens, ducks&mdash;they've all turned into monsters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson felt his stomach drop. He knew those farms well. They were massive operations. Just the poultry alone numbered in the tens of thousands, not to mention all the larger livestock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that wasn't even counting the several pet breeding facilities out there. If all those animals had turned, they wouldn't stand a chance of making it through the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chapman, we... we ran into the security forces on our way here," the middle-aged man stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did? Are they finally coming to help us?" Karson perked up hopefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man just shook his head with a heavy sigh. "Mr. Chapman, I wish I had better news. The security team was fully armed, over a thousand men strong... but they're all gone now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson felt like he'd been punched in the gut. "That's impossible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There were just too many of those monsters," the man continued. "Tens of thousands of mutated beasts came at them from all directions. A thousand men didn't stand a chance against that kind of onslaught."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The military is our only hope now," the man added, his face a mask of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's right. The military's the only ones who can get us out of this mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least Mr. Chapman's place is well-fortified. We might have a fighting chance here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group's mood was a mess of contradictions. They felt safer here than anywhere else, but they couldn't shake the feeling that it was only a matter of time before those monsters overwhelmed even these defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With all the farms around here, it's no surprise we're dealing with tens of thousands of mutated beasts," Karson said thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did the math in his head. All those farms combined probably had over 100,000 animals. That was a terrifying number to think about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their makeshift wall wouldn't stand a chance against that kind of onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They needed serious military backup, like modern heavy armor divisions, to take down all those mutated creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That explained why help hadn't arrived yet. The military was either still gathering forces or already on their way with the right equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Karson couldn't shake this gut feeling that they wouldn't make it through the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get everyone who can move to come pick up weapons," he ordered. "We have to hold this position until the military arrives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it. Everyone's going to be armed, and so are women." Norah nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swept her stern gaze across the group. "And let me make one thing crystal clear&mdash;if anyone tries to start trouble, loot, or harm any women during this crisis, I'll personally deal with them first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming from a level-two metahuman, her deadly, serious threat made everyone shiver. They quickly assured her that nobody would dare cause any problems at a time like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chapman, there's... there's one more thing, though I'm not sure you'll believe me," the middle-aged man stammered, clearly wrestling with whether he should speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson's eyebrows knitted together in frustration. "We don't have time for this. If you've got intel, spit it out."</span></p></div>
