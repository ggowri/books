        <h1>Chapter 643 Double Acquisition</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Alyssa was very confident in the Axe since she was pretty sure that the Mafia didn't dare to cause trouble easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. The fact that Alyssa dared to openly fight against the Mafia proved that she was unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, her words gave away her intention of recruiting him in terms of the capability he just showed when escaping from the assassination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied with a courteous smile. "Thank you, Alyssa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're welcome. The enemy of my enemy will be considered as my ally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was very skilled at building relationships; no wonder she could lead the Axe to glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to her keen judgment, she was a tough woman with perseverance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few years ago, she had a bloody fight with the Mafia and was shot twice, almost dying on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she killed all those shooters, which were about a dozen men, by herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle also established Elisa's reputation in Mandale Town, preventing sash provocation and enabling her gang to have a place in the gem trade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa told Alexander the address of the Axe's headquarters, and Alexander drove there according to the navigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice looked at Alyssa and showed a friendly smile. "You're such a stunner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! You look gorgeous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa and Alice had a very happy chat and soon found out the reason why the three of them came to this town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you want to buy orange and purple top-grade gems?" Alyssa pondered and frowned at Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it strikes me that you're Mr. Ulysses from the Phoenix Gemstone Establishment, right? You look familiar to me. I once saw you from a distance." Then, she shook hands with Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His growing gem business brought him some reputation around this block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You overflattered me, Ms. Bianchi. In fact, Alexander is taking care of my business." Xavier pointed at Alexander very modestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was shocked again. Phoenix Gemstone Establishment purchased hundreds of millions of gems every year, and Xavier's backer was actually Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity flickered in her gorgeous eyes as she stared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at Alyssa from the rearview mirror, admiring this bright, decisive, and tough woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exuded a wild beauty, like a female leopard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who regarded her as a mere eye candy would pay for their ignorance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, Alexander had a good first impression of Alyssa. If she was worth cultivating, he might as well help her get rid of the Mafia to help the Axe dominate the whole of Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would bring him a vast supply of gems, which meant a lot of profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alyssa's mood was surging, and she couldn't calm down for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't dare to look directly into Alexander's eyes since she felt like she was about to fall into those deep eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was the first man that Alyssa couldn't figure out, and the mystery aroused her curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the desire for exploration in her nature, she would be bound to figure out anything she was interested in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she turned to Alice and said with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's very hard to find top-grade gems these days, but I'll help you as much as I can; reward needed, of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice said in a hurry, "You can rest assured about the reward! As long as you can find the gem Mr. Hawthorne wants, we can pay you double."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was surprised again by what she called Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seemingly, Alexander was more complicated than his appearance. Alyssa wondered if he was from a noble family in Loscity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in her mind, young masters from those noble families were usually useless, slack coxcombs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those young men living high on the hogs wouldn't leave for somewhere thousands of miles away from their den.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she speculated on Alice's words, Alyssa still maintained an amicable smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, things become much easier with high reward. I'll tell the owners of gemstone mine and businessmen to purchase top-grade gems in orange and purple. What about charging you a ten percent commission?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about your safety. No one will dare to act recklessly at my headquarters. I'll guarantee your safety!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether from the perspective of cozying up to Alexander or the big deal they had just reached, Alyssa had sufficient reasons to protect Alexander and his companies.</span></p></div>
