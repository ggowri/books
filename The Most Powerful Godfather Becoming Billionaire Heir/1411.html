        <h1>Chapter 1411 Save Ourselves</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some councilors and officials who enjoy special supply treatment said you're mistreating them, and they demand an explanation from you!" After the soldier finished speaking, he fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the command room became even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph gritted his teeth and said viciously, "Those bastards. With Healiva in such chaos, there are still some people trying to hold us back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true that their food is a bit worse than before, but at least they have enough to eat. The special supply treatment is much better than that of civilians."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldier echoed, "Yeah, many people can't even get enough of the simplest bread!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph snorted, "Let them get out! Anyone who complains about the treatment in the underground shelter can leave immediately. So many people still want to get into the shelter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph waved his hand and gave the order. "Anyone who dares to cause trouble in the underground shelter, disregard the overall situation, and demand special treatment will be kicked out of the shelter. Those who resist will be killed on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Marshal Rudolph!" The soldier left. He muttered as he walked away, "Those bastards. They still have the nerve to cause trouble. Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground shelter was destined to be plunged into trouble. Those stupid people would pay a price for their actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone put forward a plan. "I suggest forming a special operations team to be responsible for clearing the transportation route to the large warehouses in the suburbs and delivering food, weapons, and ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In addition, encourage citizens to spontaneously go to the large warehouses to find food and weapons so that they can solve their own problems and relieve the pressure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the plan was put forward, it was immediately approved by most people. "In the extraordinary times, everyone is a soldier. We can't just rely on ourselves. If everyone takes action, we can have a chance to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph didn't say anything. He thought for a while and then slapped the table hard. "Good idea! We can't rely solely on ourselves. Everyone has to come out and fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Issue my order right away. Recruit soldiers in the underground shelter. Regardless of age and gender, as long as they can hold a gun and shoot, they should participate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For those who are willing to join the reserves and fight these monsters on their own initiative, all resources will be given priority!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, there will be no privileged class. Only those who go to the front line will have privileges!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Quentin swallowed and asked in a low voice, "Even women and children are..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right!" Rudolph nodded affirmatively. "If Healiva falls, what will happen to women and children? Will those monsters have mercy on them? So, all the citizens are soldiers, and they should save themselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people agreed with Rudolph's new order. The remaining few remained silent. It wasn't that they thought there was something wrong with it, but they thought the decision was very correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, the last order!" Rudolph said as he solemnly adjusted his collar and buttons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the others consciously started to tidy up their outfits and then stood at attention, staring intently at Rudolph. Everyone knew that the supreme commander would have something extremely important to announce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph said, "Everyone under the age of 60 should enter the underground command center! Leave this place to us old men!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, everyone was shocked. A sour feeling welled up in their hearts. They thought, "Is the final moment approaching?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one spoke. Rudolph touched the black box that he always carried with him. His face was ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The control button for the atomic weapon was inside this box. Rudolph had a determined expression. At the last moment, Healiva would be destroyed along with tens of millions of monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week later, huge flames suddenly rose in the distance, like fire dragons soaring into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this... an intercontinental missile?" Someone was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the survivors raised their heads, staring at the dozens of flames tearing through the night sky and shooting into the clouds.</span></p></div>
