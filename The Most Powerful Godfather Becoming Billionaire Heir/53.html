        <h1>Chapter 53 An Opportunity</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane and Belinda trudged home, their faces as gloomy as if someone had died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Andrew and the others learned what had happened, they deflated like punctured balloons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It is terrible. How will we Fairfaxes ever show our faces in Loscity again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew lamented, beating his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the Fairfax clan was wailing in despair, a group of burly men in black suits burst in, surrounding them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faced with these menacing thugs, the Fairfaxes were petrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew shook like a dog in a blizzard, his teeth chattering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're... we're done for. Alexander must have sent the Saint Group to finish us off..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sallow-faced young man with a sinister gaze walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He first looked at the bewildered Jane, then swept his gaze across the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane mustered her courage and called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did Alexander send you? What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man chuckled. "I'm Theodore Tate, son of the Brilliant Group's CEO."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane paused for a few seconds, then asked, "The Brilliant Group? Do you mean the one headquartered in Sandgo?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Silence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The burly man beside him roared, making the Fairfax family freeze in terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both the Brilliant Group and the Saint Group were multinational corporations with market values in the hundreds of billions, and both are backed by the Godfather, nicknamed "Reaper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, with Guzman at the helm as chairman, the Brilliant Group was widely regarded as more formidable and fear-inspiring than its rival, the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Mr. Tate? We are so sorry for not welcoming you properly. We didn't know you would grace our Fairfax family with your presence. What brings you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew and Belinda bowed repeatedly, bobbing their heads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore ignored them and turned to Jane with a cryptic smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Fairfax, are you interested in taking down Alexander and Ava? Do you want to truly step into high society and become a real power player?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane gritted her teeth, her face etched with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I do! It's all I dream about, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's eyes gleamed with a hint of smugness as he spoke deliberately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Brilliant Group is planning to absorb the Saint Group. Alexander and Ava are our targets for removal. Given your relationship with Alexander, you could be pretty helpful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's eyes immediately lit up, eagerly agreeing with her excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Tate, I'm at your service. Just say the word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew quickly led the Fairfax family to their knees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We, the Fairfax family, pledge our loyalty to the Brilliant Group. Please, Mr. Tate, help our family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's expression turned to one of satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Very well. Obey my orders, and once we've taken over the Saint Group, I'll ensure the Fairfax family becomes Loscity's new elite."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Fairfax family was overjoyed, as if fortune had fallen from the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane let out a long sigh of relief, her gaze toward Theodore filled with gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore surveyed Jane's voluptuous figure and provocative attire, a wicked grin spreading across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore certainly wouldn't reveal Alexander's identity to the Fairfax family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, Alexander, you're technically my uncle. Your wife is quite the looker. I wouldn't mind getting a taste of that..." he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's smile grew increasingly twisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Fairfax, would you care to join me for dinner sometime?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's mind went blank at Theodore's sudden invitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was overjoyed and quickly nudged his daughter, whispering, "Honey, Mr. Tate taking an interest in you is like winning the lottery. He's leagues above Ryan and Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's face turned beet red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, isn't this a bit... slutty of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew let out a scoff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ryan's barely keeping his head above water, and Alexander won't have you. You're divorced now, so finding another man is perfectly normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's called picking the best option. There's nothing slutty about it. If we can land Mr. Tate, we won't have to worry about the Saint Group anymore. No need to suck up to that freeloader Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda chimed in from the sidelines, egging her on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honey, don't be a fool. Mr. Tate could have any woman he wants. If he's interested in you, it must be true love. You'd better not let this chance slip away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane gritted her teeth and steeled herself before agreeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I appreciate your interest, Mr. Tate. I look forward to our next meeting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Excellent. I knew you were an intelligent girl who could read the room!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore gave Jane's chin a playful squeeze, then swaggered away, looking mighty pleased with himself.</p></div>
