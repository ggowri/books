  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Crimson let out a piercing scream, a sound reminiscent of a wounded beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Osborne roared, fury coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he was racing against time&mdash;Sin was nearby, and once he realized what </span><span>was happening, he would be there to help Crimson in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's strength surpassed Crimson's, and with all these injuries, Osborne was in no shape to go toe-to-toe with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to kill Crimson quickly and join Greyson, Roy, and the others to stand a chance against Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne unleashed everything he had, pouring all his energy into the assault on Crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had underestimated her resilience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her severe injuries and falling into Osborne's trap, Crimson refused to go down easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life force was tenacious, almost defying belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne delivered a brutal kick to her chest, something snapped within her. A surge of terrifying power erupted from Crimson, slamming into Osborne's chest with bone-crushing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" He spat out a mouthful of blood, his grip on her arm slipping as he was sent flying backward, crashing hard into the ground and creating a massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson was no better off; her chest was caved in, and countless internal injuries throbbed painfully within her. Yet, against all odds, she still clung to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hit the ground with a thud, struggling to rise once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With injuries like that, how can she still stand? Is she even a human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately for him, Crimson couldn't fully get back up. She shot Osborne a furious glance before collapsing again, blood pouring from her mouth, mingled with fragments of organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling!" Sin finally sensed something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Crimson's nearly dying, his expression turned to one of horror. He charged forward, a deadly intent radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, you&rsquo;re dead to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's figure materialized right in front of Osborne. His divine artifact dagger aimed straight for Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had expected this move. A dimensional rift opened up, swallowing him whole just as Sin's dagger struck, embedding itself into a nearby rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact caused the stone to explode, sending shards flying like bullets in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Osborne appeared hundreds of yards away, standing beside Greyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" He coughed up more blood, watching as Sin scooped up Crimson. A pity that she didn&rsquo;t die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" I still couldn't kill her. Still, I've dealt her a heavy blow. She's in no shape of fighting now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Greyson, Roy, and the others were utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Osborne has severely injured Crimson, nearly killing her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson is a top-tier Class S warrior! In the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, among thousands </span><span>of assassins, Sin ranks second, with Crimson close behind at third. While she isn't quite as strong as Sin, their differences are negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin has nearly driven us to despair, yet here is Osborne, a Class AAA, almost putting Crimson down for good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!" Greyson gasped, completely taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lambert family members stared at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin, assessing Crimson's condition, felt a surge of rage as he took in her shattered body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Osborne in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Sin vanished, but the terrifying murderous intent still hung in the air, suffocating everyone around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's face filled with alarm as he noticed Sin slipping into a stealth state once again. Dense tension in the air; no one knew from where Sin would strike next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne wore a mocking grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "That Stealth Art of yours may work on others, but not on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then spun on his heel, saying, "Everyone, follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne drew the Volt Hammer, unleashing a powerful surge of lightning aimed at a seemingly empty spot 164 feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment the lightning struck, two figures materialized, revealing Sin clutching Crimson in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning crackled viciously as it struck them, yet it barely seemed to faze Sin and Crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Lambert family's forces weren't about to miss their chance; hundreds of attacks whipped through the air, converging on the exposed duo in a torrent of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's eyes widened in shock as he realized the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, he dodged frantically but couldn't escape the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined force of hundreds of strikes hit him like a freight train, sending his body crashing against a nearby tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the barrage didn't relent; more attacks were hurtling toward him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
