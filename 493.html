  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! No! I surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter, the head of the Hawthorne family, was filled with immense fear when he saw that Shawn, Yaron, and Emery </span><span>were</span><span> all dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he knelt down and shouted for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I surrender. I'll lead the Hawthorne family and become your vassal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't kill me," Dexter cried out in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he surrendered, more people knelt before Osborne, one by one, begging him to spare their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Sorry, I do not accept your surrender. You should die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's pause, Osborne flashed behind Dexter and punched his head, causing it to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the fifth inheritance test given to him, Osborne might have accepted their surrender. After all, they were all Class A or Class A- masters, which would have been a significant help to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Godfather had tasked him with eliminating all the elites from ancient families that had colluded with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he accepted Dexter's surrender, he wouldn't be able to complete the inheritance test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Osborne wasn't that foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His slaughter continued as the forces of the four ancient families poured out. More than half of the fifteen Class A masters and over forty Class A- experts were killed by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne blasted the last Class A master from the Walker family, everyone collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't kill the remaining Class A- individuals one by one but instead used his martial art aura. His martial art aura burst forth, transforming into dozens of rays of light that killed the remaining experts one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Osborne, Class A- masters were no different from ordinary people. He could easily eliminate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the sea became quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Class A- experts from the four ancient families were dead, their blood and flesh falling into the sea, attracting numerous ferocious sharks that fought wildly over the remains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what schemes or plans they had, no matter how grand their ambitions were, in the face of Osborne's absolute power, they were all useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained calm as if he had merely accomplished something trivial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He landed on the yacht and casually waved his hand, exploding Wallace's body that was hanging from the yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four ancient families were finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't want to sever their lineage, the only option left for them was to surrender to Osborne, giving most of their assets to him and becoming his vassals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from that, there was no other way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa sighed in relief when she saw the battle ended. Although, from the beginning, it had been Osborne crushing the enemy, she was still extremely worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Don't worry. I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt somewhat emotional. What once seemed like invincible Class A masters had become no threat to him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when surrounded by a dozen Class A masters, he could handle it easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne did not fully relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unusual that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had not appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If the four ancient families did not receive help from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, how dare they come to surround and kill me? On what grounds did they think they could succeed? The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would definitely come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the surroundings with Satan's Eye, and when he looked deep into the ocean, his expression suddenly changed, and his whole body tensed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha. It seems I was discovered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, two people suddenly emerged from the water's surface, looking at Osborne with cold smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said angrily. He had considered that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would send someone to help the four ancient families but did not expect it would be them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two were familiar to him. They were Bruce and Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were Class AA, and they were strong among Class AA. Bruce was Serena's old rival. Although his strength was not as good as Serena's, the fact that he had escaped from her several times indicated that his strength was already quite terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more troublesome one was Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was the youngest disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. He was a psychic metahuman, and the huge black Death Sickle in his hand was a powerful ancient magic weapon modeled after the legendary scythe of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, Chris swung the Death Sickle three times, severely injuring Serena's soul and spirit. If it hadn't been for Bryce's timely appearance, Serena would have died. Osborne's expression became serious. He looked at Bruce and Chris, his body tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Their strength is too strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time he fought them, he had almost no ability to fight back. Both Bruce and Chris could easily kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, although his strength had improved a lot, it might not be enough to deal with these two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you scared, bastard?" Chris smiled, "Last time, we spared your life, but this time, you won't be so lucky. Our people in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> trap Serena, and Bryce is at </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain and can't leave for a short time. This time, no one can save you. You're going to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed. "Serena is trapped by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? Bryce also doesn't dare to leave </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain? What does this mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye scanned the surroundings, trying to find Bryce. According to the agreement between Osborne and Bryce, Osborne would give Bryce ten billion in exchange for his help once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after scanning for a long time, Osborne still did not find Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Osborne's face became grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> went to </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain, making Bryce afraid to leave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do I have to deal with two Class AAs by myself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's a big trouble."</span></p><div class="pagination">
