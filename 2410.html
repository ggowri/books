  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne collapsed to the ground, feeling completely drained of strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forcibly halting the nearly completed ritual caused him to suffer a terrifying backlash. Fortunately, the Blood-Sacrificing Magic given to Osborne by Primordial included methods to reduce the backlash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne would already be dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead, Osborne could recover quickly. After all, he had completely fused with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. Even if he died, he could resurrect. Some injuries meant nothing to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne had no time to heal his injuries and quickly looked at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon weakly stepped out of the eggshell. Its three ferocious heads and six pairs of wings bore some resemblance to the dragons of </span><span>Equitaria</span><span> that Osborne had seen on Blue Planet, but it was even more menacing and terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, it looked incredibly adorable in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was looking at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, and the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon was looking at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon was massive. Newly hatched, it stood about 19 feet tall. In front of it, Osborne looked incredibly small.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a trace of confusion flashed in the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But gradually, the confusion turned into surprise and joy. It slowly walked to Osborne's side, lowered its three heads, and affectionately nuzzled its heads against Osborne's chest, letting out cheerful sounds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy. "We did it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial did not deceive him. After hatching, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon would regard the first creature it saw as its mother and remain loyal to it for life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, thanks to Osborne's blood sacrifice, this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon was able to hatch. The bond between this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon and Osborne was much stronger than usual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's body had already merged with Osborne's blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It affectionately nuzzled against Osborne's body. A surge of power from its blue head flowed into Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, Osborne felt his injuries healing rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's three heads had patterns in different colors. The one in the middle had golden patterns, while the ones on either side were silver and blue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the patterns on its body and wings were all blood-red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "The power from the blue head has a healing effect. What effects do the powers of the golden head and silver head have?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial said, "Congratulations. However, this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon seems a bit different from the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon in my memory. Its heads actually have patterns in different colors. Also, the patterns on its body and wings are actually blood-red."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Touching his chin, Primordial seemed to be pondering why this situation had occurred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A normal </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is entirely gray-black, looking very ferocious and terrifying. But this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is actually colorful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "It might be because of the ritual. It wasn't hatched normally, so some mutations may have occurred."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded. "That's very likely. Anyway, it has finally hatched successfully. However, it's very weak now. You need to let it eat quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nodding, Osborne was about to take out the Beast Soul Flower. However, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon suddenly turned its head to stare at the giant eggshell, then flew over and bit into it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon easily crushed the eggshell with its sharp teeth and swallowed it all. Osborne could clearly feel the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's aura growing rapidly stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon had finished eating all the eggshells.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne noticed a thin layer of scales appearing on the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's body. These scales were also colorful, emitting faint golden, silver, blue, and blood-red glows, looking extremely beautiful. Moreover, their texture was somewhat like the eggshell, appearing incredibly sturdy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's movements didn&rsquo;t stop. It suddenly opened its three large mouths and took a powerful inhale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, all the surrounding blue mist was sucked into its stomach.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's aura grow even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne couldn't help but frown because the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's aura clearly didn't meet his expectations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Primordial, shouldn't the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon be at Empyrean Sacredness right after birth? I feel like it's not at Empyrean Sacredness now, and it seems like it's still not full."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "This is normal. A naturally hatched </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon can smoothly reach Empyrean Sacredness after eating its eggshell and the mist protecting it. However, it was hatched prematurely and forcibly through Blood-Sacrificing Magic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Compared to a naturally hatched </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, it falls a bit short, so it can't reach the Empyrean Sacredness level. However, don't worry. Quickly feed it the Beast Soul Flower until it's full. That way, it should be able to reach Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and quickly took out a large number of Beast Soul Flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the Beast Soul Flowers, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon instantly became extremely excited and happy, flying over immediately. After rubbing its three heads against Osborne, it began eating joyfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One Beast Soul Flower was instantly devoured by it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, two, three, four...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon quickly ate over a hundred Beast Soul Flowers but was still not full. However, Osborne could feel its aura growing rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt a bit distressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, one Beast Soul Flower could be exchanged for a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, and a hundred Beast Soul Flowers meant a hundred million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, they were quickly devoured by the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each bite it took was equivalent to consuming an ordinary low-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, they would definitely feel distressed too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had previously obtained over three thousand Beast Soul Flowers. Thinking that the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon would become a great helper once it grew, Osborne suppressed his heartache and kept feeding the Beast Soul Flowers to the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, after the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon consumed a thousand Beast Soul Flowers, it finally stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon burped, Osborne clearly felt its aura surge wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a buzz, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's body began to inflate like a balloon. Its originally 19-feet-tall body quickly grew to 328 feet tall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From head to tail, it was likely 984 feet long, now a true giant. Its appearance became even more ferocious, and the scales on its body shimmered with light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Empyrean Sacredness! The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon has finally reached Empyrean Sacredness. Its aura is so powerful, and its presence so intimidating." Looking at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon at this moment, Osborne was both thrilled and shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon was currently only at primary Empyrean Sacredness, but the pressure it brought to Osborne was almost the same as that from the advanced Empyrean Sacredness Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial also breathed a sigh of relief. "It has finally reached Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But immediately, Primordial frowned and said, "However, it seems to be even stronger than an ordinary </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon. A regular </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon at Empyrean Sacredness isn't this terrifying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, maybe it really mutated. This is a good thing for you. Now, give it a name."</span></p><div class="pagination">
