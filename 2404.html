  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those are two Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-level Abyssal Bones!" Osborne was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This indicates that the Magma Devourer once killed two warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne began to worry about Gerald.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the zone duel, apart from Gerald being at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, the other judges are only at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. Can they really handle the Magma Devourer?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They won't all be killed, right? No, they shouldn't. Besides, the current situation of the zone duel is being projected back to the Racial Convergence Planet. If anything goes wrong, the Glorious Divine Kingdom will definitely send more warriors. The Magma Devourer is doomed." Thinking of this, Osborne stopped worrying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After collecting the two Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-level Abyssal Bones, Osborne continued forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of these two Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-level Abyssal Bones can be exchanged for 30 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, totaling 60 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is already enough to buy a top-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even before reaching the Magma Devourer's lair, such a huge gain made Osborne very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Magma Devourer is simply my lucky star."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly sensed something unusual with the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree took the initiative to communicate with Osborne, hoping he could feed it the two Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-level Abyssal Bones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These two Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-level Abyssal Bones were almost enough for the Warfare Ancient Tree to upgrade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, the Warfare Ancient Tree growing stronger was a good thing; it could not only upgrade the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, Warfare Scythe, and Warfare Shield faster but also repair the Ascending Sacred Sanctum for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At critical moments, he could even have the Warfare Ancient Tree fight for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were just two Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-level Abyssal Bones, so Osborne was, of course, more than willing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After feeding the Abyssal Bone to the Warfare Ancient Tree, Osborne continued forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne noticed that the magma ahead had disappeared, revealing a massive space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Magma Devourer's nest is here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was thrilled and directly used spatial power to teleport into the Magma Devourer's nest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a massive space inside the mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The flowing magma around was intensely scorching. Even an ordinary warrior at Empyrean Sacredness level would be incinerated by the terrifying heat upon arrival here without special means to resist the high temperature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the center, there was a nest built with numerous dark branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne confirmed that it was the Magma Devourer's nest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Osborne's surprise, the dark branches, made of some unknown material, did not catch fire in such intense heat but remained completely intact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These branches seem unusual," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said excitedly, "Of course, they&rsquo;re extraordinary. These are branches of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore. Do you know that phoenixes perch on sycamores? Legend has it that the mighty Phoenix King only perches and resides on the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore. Only the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore can withstand the terrifying Phoenix Flame of the Phoenix King and exchange energy with it, making both even stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like this Magma Devourer is quite lucky. It actually found so many branches of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore. If these branches were sold to the Ember Phoenix Clan, they would fetch an astronomical price."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just one branch could get you a Sacred Artifact from the Ember Phoenix Clan. And there might be thousands here. You're about to strike it rich."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words, Osborne felt overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just arrived at the Magma Devourer's nest and already discovered the highly valuable branches of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore. These branches were even rare treasures for the Ember Phoenix Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Agatha is the Dark Phoenix. I can give her some when we return," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Primordial said, "You&rsquo;ve also ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame and fused with nine drops of Phoenix Blood. So, you&rsquo;re half an Ember Phoenix Clan member. These Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches will be greatly beneficial to you as well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became even more delighted. "How do I use them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "Don't rush. Your cultivation level is too low right now; you haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness. You can't use these Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches yet. I'll tell you how to use them once you break through to Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial did not tell Osborne directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very curious, but in the end, he didn't ask anything and just nodded. Then, he quickly put away all the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are a total of 10,800 branches, including 7,200 small ones and 3,600 large ones," Osborne said with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Primordial, even the smallest Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branch could be exchanged with the Ember Phoenix Clan's warrior for a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if one branch could only be exchanged for an ordinary low-grade Sacred Artifact, the value of these Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches would still be immeasurable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After collecting these branches, Osborne discovered other treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is this?" Osborne asked, pointing at the red-glowing crystals on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked carefully and then exclaimed excitedly, "Radiant Fire Crystal!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are excellent materials for crafting Ultimate Sacred Artifacts or even Supreme Sacred Artifacts. These are highly valuable, but I suggest you feed them all to the Warfare Ancient Tree. The Warfare Ancient Tree can integrate the power of the Radiant Fire Crystal into your Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this way, your </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, Warfare Shield, and Warfare Scythe can be upgraded to Ultimate Sacred Artifacts or even Supreme Sacred Artifacts more easily. Your Ascending Sacred Sanctum will also recover faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum itself is a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Even with the Warfare Ancient Tree, repairing the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is extremely difficult. But with these Radiant Fire Crystals, it's a different story."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became even happier and said, "Alright, I'll follow your advice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gathered the large pile of Radiant Fire Crystals and fed them directly to the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could clearly feel the Warfare Ancient Tree was very happy and excited at this moment. Whether it was the Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection-level Abyssal Bone or the Radiant Fire Crystal, both were extremely precious nutrients for it, allowing it to grow faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After putting away those Radiant Fire Crystals, Osborne noticed the surroundings were empty, with nothing left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit disappointed and said, "Is there nothing else here? The Magma Devourer seems a bit poor. Aside from the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches, it only had some Radiant Fire Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial rolled its eyes at him and said helplessly, "Poor? Do you know the value of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches? Do you know the value of the Radiant Fire Crystals? You know nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think there's nothing else here because the Magma Devourer didn't care for those things and threw them all into the magma pool to melt. Otherwise, after killing so many Empyrean Sacredness-level warriors of the Abyssal Clan, the Magma Devourer must have collected plenty of Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial glanced at the magma pools around the nest. "Perhaps those Sacred Artifacts were all thrown into the magma pool."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly looked over as well. He activated Satan's Eye to its maximum, trying to see if there were any treasures in the magma pool that hadn't melted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne got even more excited. "What's that?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
