  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She continued walking toward the center of the arena, coldly staring at Osborne. "I told you I would break your legs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before, I didn't face you, so you made it to the top five. If you'd met me earlier, you'd have been eliminated long ago. But now, it's not too late!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've decided. Not only will I break your legs, but I'll also seriously injure you so you can't participate in the upcoming ranking battles. Fifth place is all you're worthy of!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina's expression was full of arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, the arrogance of the Royal Family member fully revealed at this moment. She not only wanted to severely harm Osborne but also directly voiced her thoughts to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since that's the case, Osborne wouldn't show mercy either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded. "Your idea is great. Coincidentally, I have the same thought. Your legs are fine, so the sound of them breaking must be delightful. Since you're so proud, it would be quite interesting if you don't even make it into the top three in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, the crowd watching let out gasps, stunned by Osborne's remark.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he just said was similar to Seraphina's meaning. But they weren't surprised that Seraphina would say such things because her status and strength were both formidable. So, they believed Seraphina's words stemmed from confidence and arrogance, and she had the right to say so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if a Royal Family princess said such things to an ordinary person, who would be surprised?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne, an ordinary person, said such things to a princess. He wanted to break Seraphina's legs, even injure her severely so she couldn't make it into the top three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were truly shocking!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least before this, no ordinary person had ever said such things to a Royal Family prince or princess, not even in the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said in shock, "Isn't Osborne afraid of death?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although this is the arena, where strength speaks, Princess Seraphina is still a Royal Family princess. He said in front of almost all the Royal Family members that he would break Princess Seraphina's legs. Isn't he afraid of being resented and retaliated against by the Royal Family?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said helplessly, "The Royal Family won't do anything to him in the arena, but he can't stay there forever. Once he leaves, he won't be able to withstand the Royal Family's retaliation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people think Osborne must be crazy to talk to Seraphina like that. If any Royal Family member present gets upset and decides to retaliate, Osborne is doomed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this is bound to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on the viewing platform where the Royal Family members were seated, they were staring coldly at Osborne, their expressions extremely grim. It was obvious they were already angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They will definitely find a chance to retaliate against Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said, "He's doomed! Even if Princess Seraphina doesn't kill him, once he leaves the arena, he's definitely dead because the Royal Family will never let him go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person said, "The Royal Family has a hundred ways to kill him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Listening to everyone's discussions, Osborne smiled faintly and thought, "Will I anger the Royal Family? Will the Royal Family retaliate against me? So what? After I come out of Necropolis City, even if the Royal Family doesn't trouble me, I'll retaliate against the Royal Family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Very well!" Seraphina sneered, looking at Osborne as if she were looking at a dead man. "It's the first time I've met someone as arrogant as you. Then let me see if you really have the strength to break my legs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Seraphina slowly took out a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a bow and arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bow emitted an incredibly terrifying aura, as if it could devour one's consciousness. Just staring at it made you feel dizzy, as if you were about to fall into it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is my most proficient Supreme Sacred Artifact, Blackstar Bow. Since it is a Supreme Sacred Artifact, I usually wouldn't use it. After all, among opponents at the same cultivation level as me, none are worthy of me using it," Seraphina said proudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked down at the Blackstar Bow in her hands, her gaze incredibly gentle, as if she were gazing at her lover. Her fingers gently caressed it. Immediately, the bow trembled slightly, its power rippling softly, as if responding to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled and then looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "To seriously injure you, I&rsquo;ve decided to use the Blackstar Bow. Since you&rsquo;ve made me bring out the Blackstar Bow, you can already feel proud."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, take out your weapon and let it tremble before my Blackstar Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Seraphina in surprise, not expecting that Seraphina's true expertise would be in archery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Blackstar Bow's energy is incredibly terrifying and powerful, and the attacks unleashed with it are absolutely formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne remained very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmly said, "So you also use a bow. In that case, Bloodwrought Bow, come out and meet your kind."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the Bloodwrought Bow appeared in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow emitted a crimson, blood-like eerie glow, gently pulsating. It wasn't particularly intense, yet it seemed to merge seamlessly with the energy around Osborne, as if it were a part of his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the Bloodwrought Bow in Osborne's hand, Seraphina mocked, "Kindred?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is merely a Superior Sacred Artifact bow. How can it be called kindred to my Blackstar Bow? That's utterly ridiculous. If you were using a Legendary Sacred Artifact bow, I would respect your strength. Unfortunately, this is just a Superior Sacred Artifact. It seems I will win this battle with ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the Blackstar Bow in Seraphina's hand unleashed even greater energy. Just as Seraphina looked down on Osborne, the Blackstar Bow also looked down on the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its terrifying energy suppressed the Bloodwrought Bow's power, making it seem like a candle in the wind, ready to be extinguished at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow was completely suppressed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, one is a Superior Sacred Artifact, while the other is a Supreme Sacred Artifact. The gap between them is immense!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the crowd started murmuring again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said helplessly, "He's finished! Even without considering strength, the huge gap in weapons has probably already decided the outcome of this battle. I actually thought Osborne might have a tiny chance of winning before. But now, it seems he has no chance at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said in shock, "The gap between a Superior Sacred Artifact and a Supreme Sacred Artifact is like the difference between a warrior at advanced Empyrean Sacredness and one at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, or even Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Such a gap is irreversible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man suggested, "Osborne should immediately put away that broken Bloodwrought Bow, take out the Superior Sacred Artifact scythe he used to defeat Prince Matthew earlier, and engage in close combat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, Osborne might have a sliver of hope, though just a tiny bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another woman said, "The gap between their weapons is too big. Also, there&rsquo;s definitely a significant difference in their strength. I thought this would be a thrilling championship battle, but now it seems this might end quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he gives it his all, Osborne can at most withstand three arrows from Princess Seraphina."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's chatter made Seraphina smile again. She glanced at Osborne with disdain and calmly said, "Let's end this boring fight quickly. I told you, among those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness, no one is my match, including you! Let's begin!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Seraphina's Blackstar Bow shimmered with a sharp black light, quickly transforming into an enormous bow and arrow, standing tall before her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a massive arrow glowing with black light appeared on the Blackstar Bow.</span></p><div class="pagination">
