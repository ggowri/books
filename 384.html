  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suffered a big loss, but Osborne made a huge profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack ended, which meant that he had failed the bet with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the bet, Alexander had to give Osborne a level three ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the ancient magic weapon, the benefits Osborne obtained from the Blessing of Thunder were more significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He absorbed at least 70% of the power of the Blessing of Thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lightning elemental essence became extremely powerful, far surpassing the other elemental essences. Osborne felt that his affinity to lightning had become stunningly close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just thought about it and could attract countless bolts of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The improvement of the lightning elemental essence made the green Devil's Light, which had been merged with Osborne, become even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Devil's Light gradually changed. It was faintly flashing with purple lightning in the green light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt it and knew that the power was absolutely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The improvement of the lightning elemental essence increased his strength by at least 50%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just at the level of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body also received huge benefits. The power of the Blessing of Thunder gave his body a thorough enhancement inside and out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every cell in his body seemed to carry a trace of lightning power, which greatly enhanced his strength, speed, and reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Osborne wildly absorbed the power of blood diamonds, wanting to reach the limit as soon as possible and then make a breakthrough to be a Class A Power Master, but he failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the power of the Blessing of Thunder, his body finally reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could immediately make a breakthrough and become a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he succeeded, he would be able to condense the martial art aura, and his strength would become even more powerful, far exceeding that of the average Class A martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even need to break through. With his current condition, if he fought Brad again, he could definitely defeat him easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After feeling the changes in his body, Osborne felt extremely satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a huge win for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's Blessing of Thunder helped Osborne save at least half a month, or even longer, of practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had only been practicing for a month and a half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already calmed down, but when he saw Osborne looking at him, he became emotional again and clenched his fists tightly. "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and deliberately provoked, "Alexander, thank you for helping me improve my strength. The Blessing of Thunder is really useful. Unfortunately, I only absorbed 70% of it and left a little for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Alexander almost couldn't hold back his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blessing of Thunder was his!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had actually absorbed more than 70% of it and only left him a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resting power of the Blessing of Thunder was not enough for Alexander to reach his peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you!" Alexander finally lost his temper and roared at Osborne, but soon, dense lightning flashes appeared around him, indicating that his power was about to get out of control again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took advantage of this opportunity and said disdainfully, "Alexander, you look unhappy. Are you angry? I sincerely thank you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I won the bet. Don't forget to send the ancient magic weapon to me. So many people witnessed our bet. You won't regret it, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you're much weaker than I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that you will become the head of the Paltrow family next month. I'm worried about your family. Under your leadership, it will probably decline soon or even be exterminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept speaking to provoke Alexander, hoping to anger him and let his power out of control. Even if he couldn't kill Alexander, he would definitely injure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was angered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing became short, and the lightning flashes around him were moving wildly. Wade reacted quickly, rushed to Alexander, and held his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade glared at Osborne, hesitated for a moment, and suddenly hit Alexander on the neck with his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stunned Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne was a little disappointed. Wade reacted too quickly and ruined his plans several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes turned cold, and he thought, "I have to find an opportunity to kill Wade. Anyway, I will have a fight with the Paltrow family sooner or later. Wade is the only Class A Power Master in the Paltrow family besides Alexander. As long as I kill him, the Paltrow family will suffer a great loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade suddenly felt a chill, but when he looked around, he didn't know where the chill came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, stared at Osborne coldly, and sneered, "You are so bold. I won't let you go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander lost today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be smug. He lost because he didn't expect you to have the mind control power and the lightning power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't be so lucky next time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once Alexander has stabilized his power, he will avenge today's failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait and see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warn you. Clarissa is destined to be Alexander's wife. If you don't want to die miserably, stay away from her."</span></p><div class="pagination">
