        <h1>Chapter 160 Pushing the Limits</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Brian had suddenly </span><span>switched into business mode</span><span>, Celeste had no choice but to swallow her anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She straightened her clothes and handed him a document.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "</span><span>This is</span><span> about the sales issue</span><span>s</span><span> with the EnerGlow Series. Since we don't have our own channels,</span><span> </span><span>so I</span><span>'</span><span>ve </span><span>lined up</span><span> meetings with several major players in the industry. I was hoping you could </span><span>join me</span><span> and </span><span>figure this out</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright</span><span>. Give me a minute, I'll get ready.</span><span>" Brian replied with a nod. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick tidy-up, he followed Celeste to the private dining room at Atelier du Claret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room sat six middle-aged men, each exuding a commanding presence. They were all big-time distributors in the beauty and cosmetics industry, each with their own sales channels</span><span>. They were</span><span> responsible for distributing products for major brands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they saw Celeste, their eyes lit up. A flicker of surprise and admiration passed through their expressions</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>E</span><span>specially when their eyes landed on her legs, elegantly wrapped in black stockings. None of them could look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guys had seen their share of models and actresses, but Celeste's legs? Next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group were Tucker Wilson, the head of Neovue Entertainment, and Lyle Porter from Viremoor Commerce. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them smiled broadly and said, "We've heard so much about your stunning beauty, Ms. Hawthorne. </span><span>Seeing you here</span><span>, we can say the praise was well deserved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, their eyes were glued to Celeste. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, on the other hand, may as well have been invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled politely and began introducing Brian. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You flatter me. This is our company's chairman, Mr. Brian Edwards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste turned to him and said, "Mr. Edwards, this is Mr. Tucker Wilson, the head of Neovue Entertainment. And this is Mr. Lyle Porter from Viremoor Commerce. The others here are also some of the biggest distributors in the country's beauty and cosmetics sector&mdash;many of them with reach into international markets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a round of quick pleasantries, everyone took their seats. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Tucker and the others remained fairly indifferent toward Brian&mdash;nowhere near as warm as they were toward Celeste. Even though he was technically her boss, the chairman of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the conversation went on, they pretty much acted like Brian wasn't even there. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't seem to mind though</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>He </span><span>quietly sipp</span><span>ed</span><span> his wine</span><span>, unfazed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Celeste kept the drinks flowing and chatted with them about collaboration opportunities. But they all seemed hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tucker said, "It's not that we don't want to work with your company, Ms. Hawthorne. But your team has just got into </span><span>the game</span><span>. There's really no foundation or edge yet. We're worried the products just won't sell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lyle chimed in, "Exactly. </span><span>We </span><span>want to help. But launching a new line in a saturated market? It's tough to make it stand out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled and replied, "Trust me, our products speak for themselves. As long as you're willing to handle distribution and promotion, they'll absolutely be a hit in the market this year." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she laid out the products for them to see and gave a quick rundown of each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tucker, Lyle, and the others clearly weren't interested in listening. Instead, they kept pouring drinks for her</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>heir eyes </span><span>kept </span><span>drifting now and then to her smooth, delicate chest and the black stockings hugging her long legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time </span><span>Celeste'</span><span>s face turned red from all the wine, she was practically on the edge of throwing up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>till</span><span>, she</span><span> pushed forward&mdash;offering to give up 30% of the profits and even suggesting they could get a </span><span>batch of products</span><span> worth millions, free of charge, just to test the waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, they still </span><span>played hard to get</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to say something else when Brian stepped in to stop her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me handle this," he said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd had enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze on Tucker, Lyle, and the rest of them and said in a low voice, "We're all adults here, so let's skip the games. Just tell me what you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Lyle and Tucker exchanged a look. Their lips curved into mocking smirks, and their eyes gleamed with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So this Brian guy can't hold it in, huh? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A</span><span style="font-style: italic;">lready can't stay calm? Judging from this, Trillion Group must be pretty desperate. They clearly care a lot about this deal. That makes </span><span style="font-style: italic;">things </span><span style="font-style: italic;">easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Mr. Edwards, I knew you'd be straight</span><span>forward</span><span>. In that case, we</span><span> won</span><span>'</span><span>t</span><span> j</span><span>beat around the bush</span><span>," Lyle said with a chuckle, glancing at Tucker. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We</span><span> can</span><span> work together, but that all </span><span>depends on</span><span> how sincere you really are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression darkened as a surge of anger rose in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Are you kidding me? Celeste has been </span><span style="font-style: italic;">trying so hard</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> just to get them on board</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She said everything she could</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> and dr</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ank</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> until she nearly threw up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trillion Group already agreed to give up 30% of the profits and even offered them a whole batch of products worth millions of dollars for free. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they ha</span><span>d</span><span> the nerve to say </span><span>they were</span><span> the ones lacking sincerity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian forced the anger down and asked coldly, "Then tell me&mdash;what exactly would you call sincerity?"</span></p></div>
