        <h1>Chapter 92 Dylan's Connections</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think because you know a few moves, you can show off in front of me? You've got no clue who you're dealing with!" Dylan sneered, his eyes cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he smashed his glass onto the floor, watching it shatter into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could blink, a dozen or so thugs stormed in, each holding knives or axes. The sheer force of their presence made Karen's face go white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to speak when, in the blink of an eye, Brian lunged at the thugs, charging through them like a beast unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each thug went flying, crashing to the floor one by one, as if they were nothing but ragdolls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a minute, every single one of them was down, groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some fight in you, kid. No wonder you're acting so cocky..." Dylan's eyes narrowed, his tone turning venomous. "But this ends here. Mikael, Mason! Take care of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, boss," Mikael and Mason said in unison, stepping forward with dangerous smirks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room grew thick with tension, their presence making the air feel heavy. Karen's heart pounded as these two were no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were former special forces, legendary for taking down anyone who stood in their way. Dylan trusted them completely, always relying on their strength to get him out of tight spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Brian might be tough, but he didn't stand a chance against Mikael and Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just don't kill him too quick," Dylan smirked. "I want him to watch me have some fun with his woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mikael and Mason grinned wider and then, they charged at Brian, fists flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before either of them could land a punch, Brian's eyes flashed cold. In an instant, he caught both of their fists and twisted them with brutal efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of bones snapping echoed through the room. Mikael and Mason dropped to their knees, gasping in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could even recover, Brian's foot slammed into both their chests, sending them flying across the room like ragdolls. They crashed into the wall with a sickening thud, blood pouring from their mouths as they passed out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen stood frozen, wide-eyed. She couldn't believe what she was seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian wasn't just strong. He was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was nothing like the weak, useless man she'd known before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked different now, strong, fearless, and way more attractive than she ever imagined. Her heart skipped a beat as she realized just how much she was drawn to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's expression shifted into disbelief. His cigar fell from his mouth, landing in his lap, but he didn't even notice it. His eyes were glued to Brian, shocked by what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew just how strong Mason and Mikael were, but neither of them could land a single hit on Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he had seriously underestimated the guy's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the cigar burned a hole through his pants that Dylan snapped back to reality. He glanced at Brian, terror flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, wait... let's talk this through... please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could say another word, Brian reached for the ashtray on the table, picked it up, and smashed it over Dylan's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ashtray shattered, blood splattering as Dylan collapsed, groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately cupped his head with both hands, his eyes wild with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is... my fault! Take her. Take the money. I'll pay you back! Just... just don't hurt me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's shaking hand reached for the drawer where he kept his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one smooth motion, he pulled it out and aimed it directly at Brian, his voice seething with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're so tough, huh? You think you can walk out of here unscathed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on. Make a move. Just try it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a twisted grin, he pulled the trigger, the shot ringing out in the tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet raced toward Brian's head, but in one swift motion, Brian caught it between his fingers. His expression didn't even change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's mouth went dry. His heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... this can't be happening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panicking, he tried to pull the trigger again, but before he could, Brian flicked the bullet away like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan screamed as the bullet slammed into his hand, forcing him to drop the gun with a sharp cry of pain. His fingers twitched, blood dripping from the wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian caught the gun mid-air and casually pointed it at Dylan's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan froze, his voice coming out weak, shaky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... please don't kill me. I was wrong, I get it, I swear I do... just... just give me a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brian showed no reaction, Dylan's desperation kicked in. He immediately brought up his connections, hoping to scare him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know who I am! My boss is Raven! He's a major shareholder here, and he's on his way right now! If you kill me, he'll make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow, the faintest trace of recognition flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raven, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that guy had bumped into him at the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face turned ashen. Her eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean... that Raven? The one from Shadow Fang?"</span></p></div>
