        <h1>Chapter 106 Rachael's Secret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, do you feel good like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, you are so great. You are so deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I will always be yours..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Zoe's affectionate words, Brian could no longer suppress the strong impulse and whispered, "I... I'm coming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, come in my mouth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stood up. Zoe knelt in front of him and sucked his dick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let the white semen fill her mouth, spraying it on her face and her big breasts...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Zoe's moving appearance, Brian felt that his body and heart were unprecedentedly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they came to the bathtub to take a bath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just while taking a bath, they entangled together and did it again in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lay on the big soft bed, panting heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such sex consumed too much of their physical energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long rest, they finally recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Brian's handsome face, Zoe snuggled in his arms intimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, aren't you curious about Rachael's identity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian asked with interest, "Oh? Who is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe hesitated and said, "She... She is actually your fianc&eacute;e."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was shocked and sat up directly. "What? My fianc&eacute;e?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded. "Yes, Mr. Edwards. Her real name is Anastasia, and she is one of the five heirs of the Vaughn family. Your family and the Vaughn family arranged a marriage for you two. As a result, you resolutely chose to run away for Sophia. She was your original fianc&eacute;e. This also caused her reputation and fame to be greatly affected. Her status in the Vaughn family is also declining."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Zoe continued, "I guess she came to Riverwood this time to break off the engagement with you. But after meeting you, she saw your uniqueness and changed her mind. So she used the name Rachael to get in touch with you and get to know you better. You should still be under her inspection now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Zoe's story, Brian was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never thought that Anastasia would be his fianc&eacute;e, the one he ran away from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known it was her, he would not have run away, let alone marry Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of figure and appearance, Sophia was far inferior to Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of family background, Sophia was not even qualified to compare with Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Brian was really young, rebellious, and ignorant. He was blinded by the so-called love and was determined to marry Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia dared to use a fake name to deceive him and secretly investigate him. This was a bit unexpected for him. It made him feel more interested in Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if it were any other woman, they would definitely choose to break off the engagement under such circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian's reaction, Zoe couldn't help but giggle. "What? Mr. Edwards, do you regret your choice back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian did have a little regret in his heart, but due to his dignity, he said nonchalantly, "Regret? What's there to regret? I never regret anything I do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, the lows, setbacks, and hardships experienced in life are all for becoming stronger and welcoming a better future. Now I am extremely strong and not afraid of anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha. Mr. Edwards, I like your confident look the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked at Brian with fanaticism and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She firmly believed that Brian could create the glory of the War Deities again, surpass the Godfather, and become the most powerful person in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I like you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian reached out and lifted Zoe's chin, kissing her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe hesitated and asked, "Mr. Edwards, will you marry Ms. Vaughn? Will you no longer need me after you get married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's expression gradually became dim as she spoke. She lowered her head, and there were tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always regarded accompanying and serving Brian as her belief and mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Brian got married, then she could no longer be able to accompany Brian openly and be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was slightly taken aback and then smiled as he said, "Honestly, I didn't expect my fianc&eacute;e to contact me under the name Rachael. I have a bit of a fondness for her, but I have no intention of getting married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for you, I will always need you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Brian reached out and embraced Zoe's charming body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experiencing an unhappy marriage with Sophia, Brian no longer had any hope or expectation for marriage. He didn't like to be bound by the rules and regulations of marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was impossible for him to give up all women for one woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wouldn't he be happier if he were single and free?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Brian's words, Zoe was deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snuggled in Brian's arms, feeling so happy and sweet at this moment.</span></p></div>
