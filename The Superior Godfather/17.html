        <h1>Chapter 17 Reshaping the Workplace</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawthorne, is there something urgent you need to discuss with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian lay back on the couch, eyeing Celeste with genuine interest, admiring her seductive, curvy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Zoe were completely different kinds of beauties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was a tempting, alluring woman, full of sensuality and charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, on the other hand, was more of an elegant, refined woman, mature and sophisticated, with a kind of commanding allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wearing a white blazer and skirt suit, Celeste exuded an aura of graceful sensuality that made her even more captivating. Few could resist her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Brian's gaze, Celeste frowned slightly, her displeasure with him growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked up to him and handed over the document she was holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, the Trillion Group's investment conference is in two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are fifty-one companies shortlisted. I'm not sure which one we should choose for a partnership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian casually took the document, tossed it aside, and asked, "Which company do you think we should work with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of intelligence appeared in Celeste's eyes. By now, she had figured out why Brian had asked her to establish his own company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized he intended to use this opportunity to get back at Sophia and Ryan, those who had betrayed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke in a calm voice, "Naturally, it should be the company you founded. But vice president Mr. Kevin Wright has already quietly convinced many executives to back the Carter Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, the company has already unofficially decided that the Carter Group will be our partner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian furrowed his brow at the mention of the name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan had the audacity to announce the Carter Group as Trillion Group's official partner because his father was close friends with Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who supported Ryan was an enemy to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice turned cold. "What's Kevin like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's grip on the papers tightened, and anger flared in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin is not just greedy and lustful but also corrupt and self-serving. He's constantly lining his pockets and has harassed several female employees. Recently, he impregnated one of them, and she ended up jumping off a building to her death..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes narrowed, his voice ice-cold. "If he's such a scumbag, why haven't you fired him yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint bitterness crossed Celeste's flawless face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I'm the CEO, Kevin has a complicated background. He's the vice president in charge of our marketing department. He also holds important company connections and has access to commercial secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most importantly, his uncle, Thomas Lee, is the second-largest shareholder. With my authority, I can't just fire him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I did, it would cause serious damage to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fallout could range from internal unrest, with employees leaving in droves, to major shareholders pulling out, crashing our stock price..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes gleamed with cold resolve. "So Kevin's a big deal. No wonder Ryan feels so confident. But keeping him around will only create endless problems and slow the company's progress. He has to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Brian to actually take action against Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything, Brian continued, "From what I know, Kevin is close with Ryan's father. The fact that he's pushing for the Carter Group means he's probably been bribed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to have someone investigate him quietly. Gather evidence of his corruption. When the time comes, I want Ryan and Sophia to see them both thrown in jail and witness me becoming Trillion Group's official partner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face went pale, and she quickly protested, "Mr. Edwards, you can't let personal revenge ruin the company. If you go after Kevin, it will..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian interrupted her firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take full responsibility for the consequences. Just do what I've asked. Immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, make sure Kevin and Ryan don't find out about this. Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked at him, her mind filled with helplessness. She knew she couldn't change his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Brian was the chairman of Trillion Group and the largest shareholder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy heart, she said nothing more and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked out of the room, she muttered to herself, "Hmph, this guy is out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be watching to see how he handles things after taking down Kevin."</span></p></div>
