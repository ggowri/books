        <h1>Chapter 46 Anne's Sacrifice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The investment promotion conference and the banquet had come to an end. It was already eleven-thirty at night by the time Brian dropped Anastasia off at her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the banquet, he had been the undisputed center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Business leaders from all walks of life had lined up to toast him and exchange business cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark and Paul, who had been Ryan's supporters, had humbled themselves to apologize and make amends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew full well that Ryan and the Carter Group were done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the backing of Trillion Group, Brian was a rising star in Riverwood with limitless potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't afford to cross him. They had to make peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria had invited Brian to have dinner with her the next day to thank him for helping her win a 300-million-dollar deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had done his research on Aria's Queen's Construction Group, which was a top-notch construction company, one of the best in the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to outsource Trillion Group's development project in Weston to Queen's Construction Group. It would save him a lot of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian lay in the bathtub, thinking about Sophia and Ryan's miserable state, and a smile played on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being suppressed for so long, he had finally gotten his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the clear ring of the doorbell broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who could be coming at this hour?" Brian wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped a bath towel around himself and opened the door with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There stood a woman dressed provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a stunning face and golden curls. Her black strapless top, paired with a black mini-skirt and stockings, accentuated her curvaceous figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne? What are you doing here?" Brian asked, raising an eyebrow and keeping his expression neutral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne bit her lip and whispered, "Can I come in and talk to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought for a moment and then let her in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead," he said as he closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sat on the sofa, looking around at the luxurious decor and then at Brian. Her emotions were a jumbled mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always thought of Brian as a failure, someone who had been heartlessly dumped by Sophia. But now, he had risen to a height that made her look up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a mansion, a luxury car, his own company, and he was a partner at Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had truly made it, becoming a successful man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Brian had the power to destroy the Evans family with a snap of his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne nervously twisted the hem of her skirt and said in a low voice, "Brian, I know Sophia and our family have hurt you, but I'm begging you to spare Sophia and our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spare Sophia and your family?" Brian sneered, grabbing her chin roughly. "And why should I do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne looked up at him, her teeth gritted. "If you'll spare Sophia and our family, I'll do anything. Even become your mistress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mistress?" Brian's lips curled into a mocking and disdainful smile. "Do you think I'm that desperate? You can leave if that's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's anxiety spiked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evans family was already on the brink. They couldn't withstand Brian's revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I don't deserve it, but I'll do my best to serve you. Please give me a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Anne stripped off her black top, revealing her breasts encased in a bra and her sexy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she knelt in front of Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, please let me serve you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the once-arrogant woman now kneeling before him in a submissive pose, Brian felt a surge of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Anne had been no friend to him in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her beautiful face and full breasts, Brian felt his desire rising. He couldn't help but swallow hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to speak, Anne untied his bath towel and gently began to stroke his penis with her soft hand, causing it to swell gradually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Anne opened her red lips and took it into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt the warmth envelop him and couldn't help but let out a moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Anne softened her movements even more. She licked the head of his penis and then sucked on it gently yet hungrily, feeling the slippery fluid seeping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her technique was top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt an overwhelming pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't hold back his desire any longer and reached out to grab Anne's full breasts, squeezing them fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The softness in his palms made his breathing heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian's expression of enjoyment, Anne smiled seductively. She removed her sexy lace lingerie and clamped around Brian's penis with her breasts, sliding up and down slowly.</span></p></div>
