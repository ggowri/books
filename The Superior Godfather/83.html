        <h1>Chapter 83 Karen's Request for Help</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sophia stepped out of the prison, a wave of exhilaration washed over her, dispelling the dark clouds that had lingered in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that Ryan's mother was none other than Luna, the leader of the Cerberus Crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia thought to herself, "If I can find Luna with that token, as Ryan's fianc&eacute;e, she'll surely trust and support me. With her backing, I can rise again and reclaim my place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Cerberus Crew is the most powerful force in Poskon, with endless wealth and influence in the shadows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eager to set her plan in motion, she rushed to Switz Bank with Anne by her side to access Ethan's private safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she discovered a uniquely crafted dagger, its blade etched with Luna's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ethan Carter wasn't lying after all!" Sophia exclaimed, her heart racing with excitement as she admired the dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, she turned to Anne. "Anne, go back and tell my parents. I'm heading to Poskon to find Luna!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With her support, the Evans family will rise again and reclaim its former glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Just be careful out there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry; I've got plenty of friends in Poskon. I'll be fine," Sophia said with a bright smile, clutching the dagger tightly as she set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anne returned to the Evans Villa to share the news with Robert and Mary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Ryan's mother is Luna, the leader of the Cerberus Crew?" Robert exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! This is fantastic! If Sophia can win Luna's support, we will be back on top in no time. I can't wait to see those ungrateful leeches crawling back to us, begging for forgiveness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anne watched Robert and Mary's excitement, she felt a nagging unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she sensed that Ryan's death might be connected to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were true, and Luna found out, Brian would be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Cerberus Crew was no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Anne decided to confront Brian at Riverside Villa No. 9.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to know if he had anything to do with Ryan's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian wasn't surprised by her arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful smile, he asked, "So, did you wrap up Ryan's affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's tone turned serious. "I booked you a flight out of here. Why didn't you leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian shrugged, unfazed. "Why would I leave? Just because of Ryan? I'm not about to uproot my life for him. Besides, wouldn't you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Brian playfully lifted Anne's chin, his gaze lingering on her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt her cheeks flush, turning her head away. "I need you to be honest with me. Is Ryan's death connected to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't shy away from the question. "Yeah, it's definitely connected to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Anne had suspected it, hearing him confirm it left Anne momentarily stunned, her mind racing with the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne turned to Brian, her brow furrowed in confusion. "What did you do to Ryan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did he end up losing his mind and jumping off the building?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze slowly roamed over Anne's figure, a teasing glint in his eyes. "Honestly, I didn't do much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just revealed my true identity to him. Turns out, he couldn't handle the shock and cracked under pressure. He lost it and took the plunge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne gasped, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is your true identity that could push Ryan to such a breaking point?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I mentioned it before? I'm the Master of the War Deities. The whole thing with summoning Ryan? That was my doing, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Anne burst into laughter. "Brian, come on! Are you serious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been with the Evans family for years. If you were really the Master of the War Deities, I would've known!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, how could someone of that stature stoop to being a house husband in our family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's be real&mdash;your presence at Ryan's death scene was just a coincidence, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anne's disbelief, Brian shrugged, clearly uninterested in convincing her. "Believe what you want. I couldn't care less."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over Anne as she thought, "Ryan's death has nothing to do with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just happened to be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Luna and the Cerberus Crew come looking for revenge, Brian won't be implicated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Anne's phone buzzed, breaking the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Karen calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she picked up, Karen's voice came through, choked with tears. "Anne... I'm in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The loan sharks are at my door, and I can't pay them back. I'm scared to go home...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, you've got to help me! I really don't know what to do!" Karen sobbed, desperation lacing her words.</span></p></div>
