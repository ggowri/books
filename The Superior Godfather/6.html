        <h1>Chapter 6 Energy Backlash</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chill out. Handling this loser is a walk in the park," Ryan said with a sneer, cracking his knuckles and eyeing Brian with pure mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I guess the last beating didn't sink in. You've got some nerve coming back here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've been the Evans family's lapdog for ages, I'll cut you some slack," Ryan jeered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat on his shiny leather shoes and added with a sick sense of amusement, "How about you slobber all over my shoes and beg for mercy? Do that, and I might just let you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was hell-bent on shaming Brian in front of every Evans family member, crushing his pride under his feet and making sure he'd be a laughingstock for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian just smirked, his eyes as cold as ice, locked on Ryan. "What if I refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan roared, "Then I'll break every bone in your body one by one until you come crawling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes glinted with scorn. "You think you're up to it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That smart-aleck remark was the last straw for Ryan. He lost it, lunging at Brian like a rabid animal. "You mouthy punk, you're a goner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian scoffed. Energy coursed through his veins as he threw a punch, meeting Ryan's head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan felt like he'd just punched a brick wall. The impact sent him flying back over 30 feet, and a trickle of blood dribbled down his chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I got punched by this loser?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that seriously all you've got?" Brian's smirk widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan retorted, "Alright, you piece of trash. I was just messing around with you before. Since you're so eager to meet your maker, I'll give you the full-monty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ryan stomped his foot. A wave of power erupted, ripping his shirt to shreds and showing off his ripped muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia and Anne, standing nearby, were practically drooling, their eyes glued to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, like a wild bull, Ryan charged at Brian, ready to pound him into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stayed cool as a cucumber. Just as he was about to counter, something went haywire inside him. His energy turned into a chaotic mess, and a searing pain shot through his veins. His face turned as white as a ghost, and sweat poured down his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is this energy backlash?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn it! How did this happen? Is it because my body's still not used to the energy after the recovery?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ryan's fist came flying at him like a speeding missile, Brian's features contorted in agony. All he could do was clench his teeth and scramble out of the way as quickly as his wits and legs would allow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Loser! You were all talk before. Now you're just running scared," Ryan taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked deathly pale, his face drained of all color. But he pressed his lips tightly together, jaw clenched so hard it seemed like he was locking away every whimper of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's sneer grew even nastier. "Speak up! Keep that big mouth of yours going. What's the matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cat got your tongue?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, are you so scared you can't even form a word? Or am I hitting too fast for you to catch your breath? Want me to slow down and make it easier for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said nothing, just hung on, his teeth grinding as he fought the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're suffering so much, I'll do you a favor and end your misery. Remember to pick a better family in your next life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan shrugged his shoulders, and his bones popped like firecrackers. He gathered all his strength into his fist and threw a haymaker at Brian's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes widened. He gritted his teeth and threw a punch of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Brian flying off the second-floor, crashing through the railing and landing with a thud in the middle of the hall below. He coughed up a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it wasn't Brian who was hurt by Ryan; it was the backlash of energy that hit him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you think you can come for revenge? That's just downright laughable!" Ryan looked down at him from the balcony, as if he were nothing more than an insignificant bug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're just amazing," Sophia said, snuggling against Ryan's arm, her gaze full of adoration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I expected you might actually have some skills, but here you are, still just a loser. Pathetic!" Robert and Mary chimed in, their faces beaming with amusement as they applauded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Carter, you're truly a legend, the retired king of special forces. Brian's not even fit to shine your shoes," they added, their laughter filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's expression was a mix of bitterness and disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never thought her first time would be wasted on someone like Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to his feet, Brian felt the sting of humiliation wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for that sudden energy backlash, taking down Ryan would've been as easy as squashing a bug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Not thrilled with how things turned out?" Ryan noticed Brian's frustration and couldn't help but smile wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today's just your lucky day because I'm feeling under the weather. But next time? You won't be so lucky!" Brian shot back, his voice laced with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan burst into laughter at Brian's words. "Ha! All you do is make excuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to retort, Sophia chimed in, "Honey, you're about to become a partner at Trillion Group. You're someone important&mdash;why waste your time with a loser like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. I shouldn't stoop to his level... Brian, why don't you just get lost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian narrowed his eyes, locking his cold stare on Sophia. "Did you just say he's on track to become a partner at Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia smirked, her expression dripping with smug satisfaction. "What's the issue? You don't believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian asked, "How can you be so sure that the partner is him and not me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? Ha! That's a good one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia and her family erupted in laughter, looking at him like he was out of his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia spat at his feet. "Brian, maybe you should take a good look in the mirror. A pathetic commoner like you thinks you can compete with Ryan for a partnership at Trillion Group? That's just ridiculous&mdash;a complete fantasy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan grinned widely, clearly enjoying the moment. "Brian, you really don't get it, do you? The VP of Trillion Group, Kevin Wright, is my father's sworn brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The partnership was locked in long ago. What do you, a lowly commoner, think you can bring to the table against me?"</span></p></div>
