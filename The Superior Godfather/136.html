        <h1>Chapter 136 Kissed Brian</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just after Brian saw off Velmara and the others, Anne rushed over in a hurry. She was worried that Brian couldn't bear the blow and might do something stupid out of desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't expect him to be so carefree that he still had the mood to sunbathe and enjoy coffee in the garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Anne was angry. "Trillion Group is on the verge of bankruptcy, and you still have the nerve to have coffee here. Brian, you're evading problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled, put down his cup, and looked at Anne with great interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne had changed her style of dressing. Today, she wore a white striped shirt and a black pencil skirt, paired with flesh-colored stockings and high heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curvy figure looked especially alluring with such an outfit. Combined with her mature and capable demeanor, she exuded a strong sense of being a mature and capable woman, making Brian's heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anne could speak, Brian said, "Are you showing concern for me or criticizing me? The company is going bankrupt, and I'm about to become a penniless man. Can't you even let me enjoy the wealthy life one last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's heart softened, and she comforted him in a low voice, "Brian, don't give up on yourself like this. There will always be a way to solve the problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled self-deprecatingly, "What solution could there be?" He wanted to take this opportunity to see Anne's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." For a moment, Anne was at a loss for words, not knowing how to comfort or reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian waved his hand and said, "You can go. I'm disgraced and penniless, and I have no use or value for you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne clenched her fists, walked up to Brian, and grabbed his collar. "Do you really think I'm with you just to covet your money and power and take advantage of your value?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian retorted, "Isn't that the case? You... Hmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his words, Anne kissed him. The intense stimulation made him let out a moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was just about to resist when Anne sat on his lap and pried open his lips with her tongue, teasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Anne's passionate kiss, Brian finally reacted. He sucked her tongue in his mouth and tasted its softness and sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands reached into Anne's white striped shirt and held her plump breasts, which were wrapped in a white bra, feeling their warmth and softness. He squeezed them, making them change shape under his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's domineering and passionate kiss made Anne feel as if her body was about to melt. She couldn't wait to unbutton her shirt and reveal her plump breasts. "Hmm... Yeah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was instantly enveloped by happiness. He greedily licked and sucked Anne's pink nipples, teasing her with the tip of his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of stimulation spread throughout Anne's body, causing her to instinctively twist her waist and buttocks to rub against Brian's penis, which had already become stiff. At the same time, she kissed his forehead and licked his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was so attractive and lustful, making Brian unable to control himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing became heavier and shorter, and his movements became more and more eager. He rubbed Anne's plump breasts hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Brian's intense lust, Anne took off his pants, lowered her head, and sucked his penis, teasing it with her mouth and tongue and finally reaching her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stimulation made Brian feel like his body was about to melt under her teasing. He could no longer suppress his surging lust. He started heavily petting Anne's plump and round buttocks and then thrust into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the endless warmth and softness wrapped Brian, making him feel his soul float up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." Feeing Brian's hard thrust, Anne couldn't help but let out an alluring moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her alluring moan, Brian quickened the thrust. His movements became even harder and faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt as if her body was about to be split. She felt so good and got even wetter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brian felt that this was not enough. He picked Anne up and jumped into the outdoor swimming pool next to him, and then he continued the sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An even stronger feeling overwhelmed Anne. She felt as if she had merged with the water in the pool, enjoying the intense and endless pleasure.</span></p></div>
