        <h1>Chapter 93 Be Crushed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Karen's panicked expression, Dylan grinned smugly. "Since you know who my boss is, you'd better get this guy to let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he faced danger, just mentioning Raven's name was enough to scare anyone into backing off. And this time would be no different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Karen hesitated, then turned to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, maybe we should let him go. The Shadow Fang is the biggest underground force in Riverwood... We can't take them on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A small gang like the Shadow Fang? What's there to be afraid of?" Brian replied nonchalantly, as if he couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about Raven. Even the leader of the Shadow Fang would have to show me some respect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Dylan burst out laughing, thinking Brian was delusional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen frowned, clearly doubting Brian's over-the-top confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a booming voice sounded from the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even our boss has to show you respect? You sure talk big, kid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan froze, and when he saw Raven walking in with a group of men, his eyes lit up. "Mr. Knox, you're finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face went pale, and she stared at Raven with a mix of fear and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel the danger radiating off him from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven was notorious, a cold-blooded, ruthless big shot of the Shadow Fang. He was feared by everyone, including government officials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Brian remained calm, still holding Dylan up with one hand, his attention nowhere near Raven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven looked around the room, his face darkening as he saw his men lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice grew cold. "Kid, you've got guts. You come to my turf, hurt my people, and now you're just standing there like you own the place? Who the hell do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, now regaining his confidence, yelled at Brian, "Kid, my boss is here! What are you waiting for? Let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Dylan could finish, Brian slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's face twisted in pain as his teeth flew out, blood pouring from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He covered his face, eyes wide in disbelief as he stared at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of a bitch, you're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how Brian was treating him like a joke, Raven couldn't hold back his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared and charged at Brian, throwing a massive punch toward the back of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face turned pale, and she yelled, "Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian barely moved, just shifting his head slightly. His hand shot out, catching Raven's punch with ease, like he was holding a twig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's eyes widened in shock as he felt his punch being crushed in Brian's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Raven could react, Brian delivered a swift kick to his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's ribs cracked, and blood sprayed from his mouth as he was sent flying backward, crashing to the ground with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the sake of Zoe, he'd be dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen and Dylan were left in stunned silence, their eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven, the terrifying executive of Shadow Fang, was lying on the ground, completely humiliated by Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Knox..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Knox, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men rushed to him, panic-stricken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven tried to speak but coughed up more blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest heaved with pain as he looked at Brian's retreating figure, his face pale, his fear and shock palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the last time he was beaten up at the bar, Raven had been training like crazy, focusing on improving his strength and even tapping into the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt invincible. But now, just after emerging from his seclusion, here he was again, getting beaten senseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Brian, his mind racing as he asked, "Who the hell are you? Are you looking for a fight with Shadow Fang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking for a fight?" Brian slowly turned around, his gaze cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raven, I guess the lesson I gave you at the bar wasn't enough, huh?"</span></p></div>
