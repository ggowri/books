        <h1>Chapter 100 Denzel's Meticulous Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The assassination failed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's eyes narrowed, a cold gleam flashing in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you just swearing up and down that there wouldn't be any problems?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Victor forced a smile, clearly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Vaughn, Brian had lost his energy and was essentially useless. With the two top assassins from the Peerless Sect on the job, there's no reason the mission should have failed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's eyes sharpened with understanding. "So you're saying he's regained his energy, or maybe someone strong is protecting him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor nodded slowly. "It's a possibility. Otherwise, Anastasia wouldn't have wasted her time on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's face cleared in realization. "Ah, now I get it. No wonder she reacted the way she did when I suggested helping her break the engagement. But the idea of using Brian's strength to climb the ranks and seize power... it's a bit far-fetched."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor hesitated before asking, "Mr. Vaughn, do you want me to send someone after him again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One attempt is enough," Denzel replied smoothly. "If you keep trying, it'll only draw attention to us. We don't want that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned back in his chair, his smile deepening as he considered the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, let's think about this. If the Edwards family heirs find out Brian has his energy back, how do you think they'll react?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's eyes narrowed, catching on. "You mean... you want them to deal with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly," Denzel said, the smile on his lips widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But not entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just part of the plan. We can use this to our advantage and find one of the heirs who's worth working with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They use their power to help me take the Vaughn family patriarch position, and I use the Vaughn family's influence to help them fight for the Godfather role. A partnership that benefits us both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vaughn, you're a genius!" Victor exclaimed, his eyes wide in admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned by how far-reaching and meticulous Denzel's plan was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel smiled, pleased with the praise. "But for now, let's hold off. We need to see what Brian is truly capable of. If he can handle the trap Thomas set for him... then we can take the next step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he proves himself, I'll go to the Edwards family myself and meet with the heirs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Victor could reply, Anastasia stormed into the room, with Eliza right behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's expression flickered with surprise, and he quickly composed himself, greeting her with a smile. "Anastasia, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's gaze was icy, her tone sharp. "Denzel... was it you who sent the assassins after Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel feigned surprise, raising his eyebrows. "Assassins? What assassins? Anastasia, what are you talking about? Brian is your fianc&eacute;, and I'm your cousin. Why would I send someone after him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he's from the Edwards family... you think I want to start a war with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes flashed with suspicion. "So it wasn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are plenty of people who'd want him gone. I'm hardly the only one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia wasn't convinced. Denzel casually pulled a dagger from his belt and offered it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, then why don't you just kill me yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really hope it wasn't you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia looked at him, her eyes fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian is my fianc&eacute;, the man I've chosen. If anyone from the Vaughn family dares to harm him... I won't hesitate to make them regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for his response, she turned on her heel and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel watched her leave, intrigued. "Well, well. I've never seen you so angry before. Could it be... that you really have feelings for Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia didn't answer, her back stiff with cold resolve as she disappeared from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's eyes narrowed, and he turned to Victor. "Victor, how did she know about the assassination attempt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor thought for a moment. "Could it be that she was with Brian at the time? Maybe he escaped not because of his powers, but because she helped him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel showed a smile, a hint of malice creeping into his expression. "It's possible... but I still think he's regained his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, this man is starting to intrigue me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hope he doesn't disappoint. Otherwise, this little game will get pretty boring."</span></p></div>
