        <h1>Chapter 18 An Unexpected Encounter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 10 AM, Brian arrived at the Riverside Villas sales office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had no place to stay at the moment, Brian was planning to buy a villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had invited Anastasia to join him in looking at the property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the most upscale river-view villa area in Riverwood, this location not only had beautiful surroundings and convenient transportation but was also considered top-notch in terms of geography.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, the price was equally steep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the smallest villa would cost over 15 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the hefty price, the sales office was still crowded with potential buyers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The showroom was buzzing with activity, attracting elites from various industries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian scanned the room, and his eyes immediately landed on Anastasia, sitting in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she wore no makeup, her wavy hair cascading loosely over her shoulders, and a long white dress that revealed her perfect figure. Her simple yet elegant attire exuded a cold, refined beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting there like a solitary lily in full bloom, she caught everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian quickly walked over and greeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, sorry to keep you waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. I just got here," Anastasia responded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was pleased that Brian had invited her to join him in viewing the property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bit of casual conversation, the two of them moved to the model display to choose a villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the overwhelming popularity of the property, the sales agents were all busy attending to their clients, leaving them largely ignored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, a sales consultant with an intern badge approached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her enthusiastic introduction, Brian quickly set his sights on the most expensive villa, number 9.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, what do you think of this one?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia thought for a moment before replying, "The quality of this villa is excellent, the location is prime, and the river view is beautiful. It's definitely worth buying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, we'll take this one. Full payment by card," Brian said decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intern was ecstatic when she heard Brian's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never expected such a wealthy and generous client.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please wait a moment, sir. I'll handle the paperwork right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Brian waited for the paperwork to be processed, he spotted a few familiar faces in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ryan, Sophia, Anne, Robert, and Mary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Brian saw them, Ryan and the others noticed him too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's pupils constricted, and his face froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, how is this possible? I sent Raven, one of Shadow Fang's key members, to take care of him. How is he still alive?" Ryan muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face also turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's expression darkened, her eyes filled with a complicated mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost... it's a ghost!" Robert and Mary screamed in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had assumed Brian must have been killed by the gang last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their loud cries immediately drew the attention of everyone in the showroom. The five of them were mortified, wishing they could disappear on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had burned down their villa, and now, they had come here to purchase a new one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined they would run into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smirked as he watched their stunned reactions. He walked over to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Surprised to see me still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, they were all speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were indeed surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had hired the gang to take care of Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that Raven, one of Shadow Fang's most trusted men, would fail to eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia clung to Ryan's arm and whispered, "Darling, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan thought for a moment before replying, "Most likely, Raven and the others didn't get the chance to act, so this guy managed to survive. I'll call them later to check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia, Robert, and the others all agreed with this explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were certain that if Raven had really made a move, Brian wouldn't have lived to see this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan sneered, "Don't get cocky, you won't be happy for long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia couldn't resist mocking Brian. "What are you doing here? I see they're hiring janitors outside. Don't tell me you've come to apply for the job? You really are a pathetic, poor loser."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Sophia's taunts stung Brian deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to speak, but Anastasia walked over, linking her arm with his and looking at Sophia with a defiant gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apply for a job? What are you talking about? My dear is here to buy a villa."</span></p></div>
