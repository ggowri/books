        <h1>Chapter 32 Godfather</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian ignored Celeste's thoughts and quickly grabbed a pen and paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's he writing?" Celeste wondered, watching him scribble away with intense focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Brian finished writing and handed the document to Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are exclusive formulas for three beauty products, with detailed ingredients and instructions," Brian explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to register a subsidiary company and use every connection and resource to develop and manufacture these products. I need samples in two weeks and want them on the market in a month. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stood there, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Trillion Group was a major real estate company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Brian planning to pivot into the beauty and cosmetics industry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of move was this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there a problem?" Brian asked, his eyebrows slightly furrowed when Celeste didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, Celeste said, "Mr. Edwards, our company has built quite a reputation in real estate over the years. With the property market at its peak, isn't it a bit reckless to suddenly pivot to cosmetics?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know how brutal the competition is in the cosmetics industry. If we fail, we won't just lose our investment! It could seriously damage or even destroy the company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled gently and explained, "The aging population and slowing population growth are serious issues. The real estate market may look prosperous, but it's full of bubbles and on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"New energy, tech chips, and medical beauty will be the future growth areas. Among these three industries, medical beauty has the lowest entry costs. Our transition serves risk mitigation and strategic positioning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Celeste could respond, Brian continued, "I know what you're worried about, but let me assure you. These three beauty products use exclusive formulas. Their effectiveness will completely change people's perceptions. Once launched, they'll become global bestsellers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just proceed as I instructed. Remember, this must be kept confidential, including my identity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian preferred to keep a low profile. He had no intention of revealing his position as chairman of the Trillion Group yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence in these three products came from a remarkable source. Years ago, while carrying out a family mission, he had saved the life of a highly respected elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This elder had lived for over 150 years and was an undisputed medicine master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a thank you for saving his life, the elder shared his life's work&mdash;an exclusive formula he'd spent decades perfecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't just beauty treatments. They included cures for diseases, life-extending remedies, and even cancer treatments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any single one of these formulas would revolutionize modern medicine if released to the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't understand where Brian's confidence came from, and she disagreed with his approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, she suggested, "This is a major decision. Shouldn't we call a shareholders' meeting and put it to a vote?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression remained cold, and his tone left no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That won't be necessary. Everything will be done exactly as I said and happen immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Celeste could finish, Brian's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia who was calling to ask when he could help with her treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's mood instantly lifted as he contemplated the intimate scene of treating Anastasia's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to go now," he curtly told Celeste before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste watched Brian's retreating figure with a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After much consideration, she pulled out her phone and dialed Godfather's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation concerned the Trillion Group's survival, and she felt it necessary to report to Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call connected quickly, and a deep, authoritative voice entered the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste could feel the terrifying authority radiating through his voice even across thousands of miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied with deep reverence, her expression devout, "Godfather, Mr. Edwards believes the next big opportunities lie in three industries. New energy, microchips, and cosmetic medicine. He says the real estate market is a bubble on the verge of collapse, so he plans to pivot the company into the beauty and cosmetics industry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather fell into a long silence on the other end of the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his silence stretched, the pressure Celeste felt through the phone grew more intense, making her face pale and her breathing difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, the Godfather suddenly burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This kid's vision and perspective are sharper than the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the beauty industry is cutthroat! Can an outsider like him make it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Celeste felt the pressure lift and took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Godfather to agree with Brian's views.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could speak, Godfather continued, "Celeste, proceed with everything as the kid suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see what tricks he can pull off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste quickly responded with utmost respect, "Yes, I understand, sir!"</span></p></div>
