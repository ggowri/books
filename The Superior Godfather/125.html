        <h1>Chapter 125 The Temptation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brian returned to his upstairs bedroom and opened the closet, he found Anne curled inside, her eyes filled with hurt as she stared back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in her expression sent a wave of guilt through him. "Anne, I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I come out now?" she cut him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Brian said, extending his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anne ignored the gesture. She stepped out of the closet and began gathering her clothes in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could have accepted being asked to hide, but his threatening tone had crossed a line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always been clear about where she stood with Brian, never asking for more than he was willing to give.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without his warnings, she would never have revealed their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his cold attitude had cut deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It confirmed her worst fears&mdash;that she meant nothing to him beyond physical release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization was a blow to her dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing her distress, Brian moved to embrace her from behind. "Anne, I'm so sorry. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done nothing wrong," she said, her voice carefully controlled as she pulled away from his grasp. "I was the one who was shameless and kept bothering you. Don't worry&mdash;it won't happen again. You're free to pursue whoever you want openly," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned and walked away, her determination palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian watched her go, his expression twisted with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had things gone so wrong? Had he done anything wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time to dwell on it. He pushed the thoughts aside and called Zoe about raising funds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards," she reported, "all War Deities assets are under the Lord of Wealth's control. She's en route to Riverwood now. Sam and I can only manage two billion dollars on short notice. Would that be sufficient? We could try to gather more if needed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's consideration, Brian replied, "That should do. Transfer it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning found Brian at Trillion Group, summoned by Celeste for a meeting with Damian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lounged in his chair in the chairman's office, languidly listening to Celeste's report while his gaze lingered appreciatively on her legs, elegantly showcased in black stockings with red trim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to admit, Celeste cut a striking figure. Those legs, emphasized by her red skirt and the provocative black-and-red stockings, perfectly embodied sophisticated sensuality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching his intense stare, Celeste frowned. "Are you even listening, or did you just come here to ogle my legs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes snapped to her face with feigned innocence. "I'm sorry, what was that? Something about wanting me to touch you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" she cut him off sharply. "I said Thomas has orchestrated a mass absence of senior executives today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian suppressed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with the company in crisis, he still has the composure to flirt with Ms. Hawthorne. Truly the bearing of someone from a powerful family." he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let them play their games," Brian said dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his gaze drifted back to the red silk trim at Celeste's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's frustration was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's admiration for Brian only grew. Such unshakeable confidence, even now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to speak when his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the screen, he said, "Mr. Edwards, it's Thomas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it," Brian directed. "Let's hear what he has to say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian nodded slightly, answered it, and put Thomas on the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' smug voice filled the room. "Damian, have you considered my proposal from last night? What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian seized his moment to prove his loyalty. "Thomas, I'm nothing like you. When I commit to something, I see it through. I've chosen to work with Mr. Edwards, and I won't betray that trust. If you're asking me to help you destroy Trillion Group, you can forget it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was completely confused by Damian's vehemence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has he lost his mind? Thomas wondered. "Where does he get the nerve to speak to me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damian," he said, his voice turning to ice, "are you certain you want to keep backing that loser, Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The insult made Damian's anger boil. "A loser? Look in the mirror, Thomas. You and your whole family are the real losers here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think being Denzel's lapdog makes you important? You're delusional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Taking on Mr. Edwards? You're just digging your own grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up before Thomas could respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stared at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She barely recognized this version of the usually composed and diplomatic Damian. She half wondered if he'd been possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian watched Damian with newfound interest, a slight smile playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's sharper than I thought," Brian mused. "With the right opportunity, he could go far."</span></p></div>
