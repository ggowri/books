        <h1>Chapter 37 An Awkward Encounter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 7:40 PM, business tycoons, wealthy families, and socialites from all sectors began arriving at the Plato International Hotel for Trillion Group's investment conference, creating a glamorous red carpet affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anastasia stepped onto the red carpet on Brian's arm, they immediately became the center of attention, causing quite a stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The media photographers went crazy, snapping pictures of them non-stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, who's that gorgeous woman? She's stunning. Her looks, figure, and that presence... she's top-tier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy is super handsome, too. You can tell he's some big shot from a wealthy family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, does anyone know who they are? I don't think I've ever seen them before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No idea, but just look at their appearance and aura... they must be someone important!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia and Ryan had just arrived when they overheard these comments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces darkened when they spotted Brian and Anastasia on the red carpet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jealousy flashed in Sophia's eyes as she spat out angrily, "What's wrong with your eyes? Brian, a big shot? Let me tell you the truth! He's just a loser I dumped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her outburst immediately drew many curious glances from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that the loser Brian you divorced recently, Ms. Evans?" asked someone who knew Sophia, their face filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia nodded. "That's him. God knows what's wrong with that woman to be interested in someone like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria Jenkins, CEO of Queen's Construction Group, frowned slightly, giving Sophia a skeptical look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, are you sure you haven't mistaken him for someone else? The man I saw had both looks and presence. He's definitely not a loser."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan cut in irritably. "Even if Sophia could be wrong, you think I'd make the same mistake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That loser is Brian! He just got lucky enough to hook up with some rich beauty who bought him fancy cars and a mansion. She even started a company for him. Now he's talking big about competing with me to become Trillion Group's partner. It's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was startled by Ryan's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces quickly broke into flattering smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew about the connection between Ryan's father, Ethan, and Kevin, the VP of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was already Trillion Group's chosen partner-to-be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Mr. Carter, you're joking! Everyone knows the Carter Group is locked in as Trillion Group's partner. What chance does that gold-digger have against you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, Mr. Carter. Let me be the first to congratulate you on becoming Trillion Group's partner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Carter, congratulations! Don't forget about your old friends when you make it big!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, everyone. There'll be plenty to go around..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan beamed at their flattery, feeling downright smug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A proud smile spread across Sophia's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the man she had chosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a loser like Brian, who relied on women, even compare to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Aria shook her head and turned away, her mature and alluring figure swaying as she walked toward the inner conference hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having met countless people, she knew Brian's air of nobility and refinement wasn't an act, nor did she believe he was just a man living off women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything, Ryan seemed shallow. He constantly showed off his family connections, put on a fake front, and chased empty fame&mdash;not the type who would achieve anything significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the investment conference was about to begin, people started filing in to find their seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian and Anastasia had just settled into their second-row seats when Ryan and Sophia sat beside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Ryan and Sophia shot Brian mocking smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, look who dared to show up," Ryan sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you two can be here, why can't I?" Brian shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's smirk grew even more condescending. "Don't tell me you think you can steal the Trillion Group deal from me just because you have Celeste backing you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their smug expressions, Brian couldn't help but smile. It was his showtime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd let this pathetic couple enjoy their moment before crushing their spirits and leaving them in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he feigned surprise as he addressed Ryan and Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know I was acquainted with Celeste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, we know more than that. We know you beat up Kevin to get a deal with the Trillion Group. You forced him to sign that cooperation agreement," Ryan sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me a broke nobody like you thought that contract would hold up?" Sophia said with a sneer.</span></p></div>
