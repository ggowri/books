        <h1>Chapter 138 Made a Clarification</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Anastasia's delicate face, Brian asked with a smile, "Ms. Vaughn, aren't you afraid that I'll run away with the money? Or what if I can't pay this money back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia had a charming smile. "I trust my judgment of people, and I believe that you're not that kind of person. I have faith that you can get through this crisis. By the way, don't call me Ms. Vaughn. It makes us seem distant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Brian was about to say something when Anastasia clenched her fist and made a gesture of cheering him on. "Come on. I believe in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took a deep breath and nodded. "Rachael, I won't let you down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go deal with the company's affairs. I have something else to do. See you." Anastasia nodded and turned to leave with Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Anastasia's back and the bank card in his hand, Brian smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anastasia's support as cover, he didn't need to reveal too much of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Celeste called Brian and reported, "Mr. Edwards, the company is surrounded. Damian and I can hardly hold on. Please come over and take charge of the situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'll be there right away." After hanging up the phone, Brian pondered for a moment and then called Zoe and Sam. He ordered, "Gather some people and accompany me to Trillion Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought, "Those guys have been acting up for so long. Now it's time to fight back and make them pay some price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the main entrance of Trillion Group's headquarters building, many people came to demand repayment of debts and gathered there, and there were all kinds of banners for debt collection everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to prevent the situation from escalating and causing casualties, the government dispatched a large number of special police officers to maintain order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd yelled, "Trillion Group, a heartless enterprise! Return our money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trillion Group has no morality or credibility. Pay back the money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Brian got out of the car, he saw debt collection banners and heard the angry shouts and roars of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around, there was a sea of people. The scene was extremely spectacular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a scene was indeed a headache. If the government hadn't dispatched special police officers to maintain order, the crowd would have rushed into the building and caused a huge commotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Celeste and Damian said on the phone that they could hardly hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a lively scene! Why haven't they started fighting yet? I can't wait to fight." Sam looked thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight? Are you crazy? Do you want the crowd to tear down the company?" Zoe rolled her eyes at Sam and snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Follow me in," Brian smiled calmly. He was about to lead them to enter the company through the side door, but he was surrounded by a group of unscrupulous reporters who had been lying in wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some reporters were taking pictures of Brian, and others were asking him questions with microphones in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporters asked, "Mr. Edwards, there are rumors that Trillion Group's capital chain has broken. Is it true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, as the leading enterprise in the real estate industry of Azuriath State, Trillion Group is now on the verge of bankruptcy under your leadership. What do you have to say about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, regarding the rumors that Trillion Group is about to go bankrupt, what do you want to say to everyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam and Zoe's faces darkened when they heard these questions, and they were about to take action, but Brian stopped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian narrowed his eyes, and he pressed his hands down. An invisible imposing aura spread, making everyone present feel as if there was something heavy pressing on their heads. The noisy scene became quiet instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took the microphone handed over by a reporter, faced all the reporters and cameras calmly, and said, "Hello, everyone. I'm Brian Edwards, the new president of Trillion Group. Regarding the remarks that Trillion Group's capital chain has broken and is about to go bankrupt, I hereby clarify that all of this is nothing but rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the debt problem of Trillion Group, I will solve it today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some people say that I'm a commoner from the lowest stratum of society. That's right. Like most people, I'm indeed an ordinary person. But precisely because of this, I know what the public wants and needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the future, I will lead Trillion Group to create more useful products, serve the public better, improve everyone's quality of life, and meet everyone's living needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, please remember this. As long as I'm here, Trillion Group will never go bankrupt. Thank you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Brian ignored that group of reporters and turned to walk into the Trillion Group headquarters building.</span></p></div>
