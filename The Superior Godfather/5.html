        <h1>Chapter 5 A Widow's Desire</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's dress was torn apart, revealing her voluptuous, mature figure to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of her full, ripe breasts left Brian breathless, his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never imagined Anne's body could be so lush, so inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intoxicating scent of her skin only added to the turmoil rising within Brian, leaving him disoriented and overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne tried to protest, but Brian's hands were already gripping her soft flesh, squeezing it mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unprecedented softness sent his eyes blazing, his movements growing rougher, more frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he still wasn't satisfied. He buried his face in her chest, devouring her warmth greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm... mmm... oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, widowed for years, had grown used to the emptiness, the loneliness. But now, she couldn't withstand Brian's relentless assault. Her breathing quickened, and she found herself moaning, the sounds escaping her lips like a primal call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's fervor only intensified at the sound of her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced her lips apart, his tongue diving into her mouth with a hunger that left her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands roamed her body, finally reaching the wet, hidden place between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt her resistance crumbling, replaced by an overwhelming desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out, her hands finding the hardness of him, the heat that seemed to pulse with life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart raced as she finally gave in, pulling away just long enough to strip him of his pants. She knelt before him, her lips wrapping around his member, taking it in deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if this act alone could fill the void that had haunted her for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian showed no mercy as he looked down at her, his expression harsh, unyielding. He grabbed her head, forcing her to take more of him, his thrusts rough and unrelenting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in one swift motion, he pushed her onto the bed and entered her, the warmth enveloping him like a tight, unrelenting grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He groaned in pleasure, his movements growing more savage, more relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, stop... oh God, this is too much..." Anne begged, her voice trembling, her body slick with sweat, her frame shuddering with each brutal thrust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slapping sound of flesh against flesh filled the room, a rhythmic reminder of the raw, primal act they were lost in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the room, Robert and Mary were pacing the floor, hearts in their throats as they listened to Anne's heart-wrenching pleas that were a mix of sobs and cries for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that Brian was giving Anne a real hard time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They threw their weight against the door like bulls, but it was as stubborn as a mule and wouldn't budge an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's desperate cries went on for more than half an hour before finally fading away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just then, Sophia came rushing back with Ryan hot on her heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, thank goodness you're here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your sister trashed that loser Brian's photo album. He went ballistic and dragged her into the room to get his payback. You gotta do something to get her outta there," Robert and Mary said, scurrying up to Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face turned as gloomy as a thundercloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That no-good Brian had the gall to come back for revenge and even took out more than a dozen bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I thought he was a washed-up has-been?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Sophia's jitters, Ryan gave her shoulder a reassuring pat and flashed her a confident grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you worry your pretty little head, honey. I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the solid strength of Ryan's broad shoulders, Sophia felt a wave of security wash over her. "Okay, honey. It's all yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan nodded, and power seemed to crackle through his body like electricity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reared back and kicked the door with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door that Robert and Mary had been pounding on like crazy flew open with a single, powerful kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room, Brian was slouched in a chair, puffing on a cigarette and eyeing Anne, who was curled up in the corner like a scared kitten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This chick was a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder she was always riding my case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She was probably just pent-up and taking it out on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had your fill, right? If not, we can go another round."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Anne's face went beet-red with a mix of shame and anger, and she shook her head like a madwoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never thought Brian would be such a powerhouse. It felt like she'd been through a wringer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, it was a whole new experience that left her feeling all tingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The amazing sensation had her under its spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth against the pain and quickly fixed her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Anne stared daggers at Brian. "You better keep your trap shut about this. If you breathe a word, I'll make your life a living hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door burst open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, Sophia, Robert, and Mary stormed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anne's state, Sophia furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I thought Anne got the living daylights beaten out of her by Brian for over half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why doesn't she look that bad? She just looks like she's been crying, and her mouth and face are a bit puffy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling the humiliation inflicted by Brian, Anne felt a hot flush rise to her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head slightly and mumbled, voice soft and a bit unsteady, "I'm fine. Just feeling a bit sore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were certain that Anne was safe and unharmed, Robert and Mary whipped around to face Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were ablaze with fury, like two wildfires ready to consume him. Robert practically spat out the words, "Brian, Sophia brought Mr. Carter here. You're as good as done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia regarded Brian with such utter contempt that it was as if he were already a forgotten memory buried deep in the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You good-for-nothing piece of filth. I let you off the hook last time, and here you are, brazenly showing your ugly mug again? You've got some nerve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she turned to Ryan, her tone laced with venom. "Honey, teach this scumbag a lesson he'll never forget. Crush him into nothing and make sure he becomes fish food."</span></p></div>
