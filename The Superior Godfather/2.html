        <h1>Chapter 2 Awakening of Extraordinary Abilities</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car doors opened, and a stunning woman in a red dress, wearing sunglasses, led hundreds of burly men in suits out of the vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Brian lying by the roadside, covered in blood, Celeste Hawthorne was horrified and rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, wake up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted to the others, "What are you standing around for? Hurry, get Mr. Edwards to the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, Brian finally regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being rushed to St. Peter's Hospital and undergoing a series of emergency treatments, his condition stabilized, and he was moved to a VIP ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his amazement, he discovered that the energy that had once vanished from his body was now rapidly returning, becoming even more abundant and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed that once his injuries healed, he would be stronger than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization filled Brian with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Perhaps this misfortune has turned into a blessing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked at him lying in the hospital bed, her eyes full of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian asked, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the stunning beauty by his bedside, a hint of confusion flashed in Brian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste replied solemnly, "I'm Celeste Hawthorne, president of Trillion Group. The Godfather ordered me to assist you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "He said you could regain the qualification to be the Godfather's heir! The condition is that you now become the chairman of Trillion Group, double its market value within a year, and keep yourself alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, she didn't have much confidence in Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Brian had lost his energy and become a cripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the other heirs would never allow him to regain the qualification to compete for the position of the Godfather's successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would stop at nothing to target Brian, even if it meant sending him to hell for that position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said calmly, "Alright, I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart remained untroubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew that after leaving his family, he had, through his own strength, become the last Warlord of Eldoria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather was a figure who instilled fear throughout the nation, but he, as a Warlord, was also capable of overthrowing a country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the energy within him was restored, accomplishing all this wouldn't be difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if thinking of something, he asked in a deep voice, "If I remember correctly, Trillion Group is planning to develop that piece of land in Weston and is publicly recruiting partners?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste didn't expect Brian to start discussing work so soon and quickly replied, "Yes, currently, twenty companies have passed the preliminary screening, including the Carter Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Carter Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold light flashed in Brian's eyes, and a mocking smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that Ryan was the president of the Carter Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia was with Ryan because Ryan claimed to be Trillion Group's designated partner...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian decided to begin his revenge with this bidding process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to give this adulterous pair hope and then plunge them into utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian instructed Celeste, "Register a company in my name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, that man is Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the hospital room, a tall, sexy figure coldly observed Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her name was Anastasia Vaughn, a billionaire hailed as the top businesswoman in Azuriath State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not only the heir to the Vaughn family but also Brian's fianc&eacute;e, whom he had never met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Brian's refusal of the family's arranged marriage had greatly affected her reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family butler, Kale Walker, respectfully answered, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia asked coldly, "Have you found out why he fled the marriage back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale replied, "Ms. Vaughn, we've discovered that Mr. Edwards fled the marriage and even left his family, giving up his qualification to inherit the position of the Godfather, all for a woman named Sophia Evans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ridiculous part is that, in the end, Sophia betrayed Mr. Edwards. She not only had an affair with Ryan in front of him but also severely injured him and threw him off a building..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, a cold light flickered in Anastasia's eyes, and her beautiful face frosted over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of the reason, Brian's refusal to marry her was a great humiliation to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia asked, "Is that woman named Sophia very outstanding and beautiful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale replied, "In terms of figure and appearance, she isn't a tenth of you. In terms of family background, she can't compare to you at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes turned cold as she looked at Kale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Then tell me, why would Brian abandon me for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale thought for a moment and said, "Perhaps it's because Mr. Edwards hasn't met you, and coupled with his rebellious nature, he didn't want to accept the family's arranged marriage, so he acted this way..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the coldness on Anastasia's face dissipated, replaced by a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale hesitated and said, "Ms. Vaughn, Mr. Edwards has ended up in such a state because of a woman; it's his own fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being with such a man has no future. When do you plan to break off the engagement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia appeared contemplative, her eyes gleaming with wisdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no rush to break off the engagement; let's observe him secretly for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can overcome this predicament and rise again, I might consider giving him another chance."</span></p></div>
