        <h1>Chapter 95 Be Fascinated</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they exited the loan office, Karen's gaze lingered on Brian, a mix of disbelief and curiosity clouding her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd only brought him along to help clear her debt with Dylan, but she never expected the whole situation to spiral out of control, especially when it caught the attention of Raven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What stunned her even more was how Raven, after meeting Brian, had humbled himself so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he apologize, but he also handed over 200 million dollars to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, not only had Brian spent nothing, but he'd also made over 100 million dollars in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the bank card in her hand, Karen felt as though everything that just happened could've been a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, she'd given herself to Brian, but it had been more of a transaction than anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she hadn't had any real feelings for him. In fact, she felt a little disgusted by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Brian had always seemed like a useless good-for-nothing who had only gotten lucky being chosen as a partner with Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after what had just happened at the loan office, her view of him had started to shift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't some useless person at all. Not only was he good in a fight, but his background was a total mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the higher-ups in Shadow Fang showed him respect, and he'd even claimed that their president would have to respect him too, which didn't sound like boasting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, she felt genuine curiosity about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she thought about Sophia already divorcing him, she couldn't help but feel sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of looks and physique, Brian was far more impressive than Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when it came to strength and connections, Brian was leagues above him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen couldn't understand how Sophia could have ever been interested in Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she looked at Brian's handsome side profile, she found herself asking, "Brian, be honest with me. Were you always pretending to be useless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, clearly amused, replied, "Before you needed me to pay your debt, you were all respectful. But now that you've used me, you're questioning me? You women really are unpredictable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Karen's cheeks flushed, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief silence, she pushed the bank card Raven had given her into Brian's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here. This is from Raven. Our deal is done. From now on, we owe each other nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow, clearly displeased. "What do you mean? When you were asking for my help yesterday, you didn't say it like that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen smirked, lifting her chin playfully. "So, what exactly did I say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought for a second before responding, "You said that from now on, you'd be my woman..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen grinned, looking at him with a spark of mischief in her eyes. "Did I say something wrong? Am I not your woman now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she was now technically his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his hesitation, Karen couldn't resist pushing the joke further. "So, do you plan on keeping me as your woman forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never said that. Didn't you say it yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen laughed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never said that...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, I've got to go. Take care!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without giving him a chance to reply, she hailed a cab and left, her exit smooth and confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a woman with experience, she knew exactly how to handle a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian watched her walk away, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way she'd switched from warm to cold so quickly left him feeling unexpectedly discarded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the taxi, Karen caught a glimpse of him through the rearview mirror, a sly smile curling at the corners of her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Sophia had already moved on, Karen had decided to make her own move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Brian wasn't just any man. He was mysterious and fascinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his skills in bed were extraordinary, leaving her with an unforgettable experience that made it hard to stop, a desire she couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to drive back to the villa, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked it up, and Anastasia's calm, clear voice echoed from the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, what's keeping you busy these days? Is it okay if I come over for dinner tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Anastasia's graceful, almost ethereal beauty and her stunning figure made Brian smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dinner? Of course, no problem. I'll head out for ingredients right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! I'll get ready and head over to your place. See you soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint but genuine smile played at the corners of Anastasia's lips, breaking through her usual icy composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After days of dining out, she was more than ready for a home-cooked meal from Brian again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's got you so cheerful, Ms. Vaughn?" Eliza, just finished with her workout, asked, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just called Brian and told him I'd be coming over for dinner. He said yes!" Anastasia replied, a hint of excitement in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Going to his place for dinner?" Eliza's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of Brian's cooking made Eliza's mouth water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered the last time and how completely blown away she had been by his skills in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Eliza threw her arms around Anastasia's, batting her eyelashes playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vaughn, can I come too? Please?"</span></p></div>
