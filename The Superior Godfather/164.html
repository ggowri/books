        <h1>Chapter 164 A Touch of Temptation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared down at the groveling figures of Tucker and Lyle, his face an unreadable mask, cold as stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you're sorry? Where was that remorse earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit like a slap and bitter regret twisted the faces of Tucker and Lyle. Their hearts sank, heavy with the weight of their mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they'd known Brian was this formidable, they'd never have dared to strut around so arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror gripped them. They had no desire to end up like Wolfgang. Desperate, they threw themselves into fervent apologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, we swear we've learned our lesson," Tucker pleaded. "Please, show us mercy. We'll prove our sincerity, do whatever it takes to get your products out there, and open every door for Trillion Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you weren't still useful to me," Brian cut in, his voice low and menacing, "I'd have ended you right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened further, and with a sudden flick of his wrist, he hurled his wine glass to the floor. It shattered into a thousand glittering pieces, the sound sharp and final.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cross me again, pull any sneaky stunts behind my back, and this will be your fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Brian stood, motioning for Celeste and Zoe to follow. He strode out of the room, leaving a heavy silence in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, take care," Tucker mumbled weakly as Brian's figure disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he was gone, Tucker, Lyle, and the others let out shaky breaths, their bodies sagging with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that relief was fleeting. Their eyes drifted to Wolfgang's lifeless body sprawled on the floor, and a chill ran through them. Their expressions grew complicated, a mix of awe and dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang had been a titan in Riverwood's underworld, a name that carried weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here he was, dead before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight deepened their fear of Brian, cementing a resolve to never cross him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant bleeding money, they'd push Trillion Group's three products to the top, no questions asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, were you ever part of the underworld?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the drive back, Celeste's curious gaze fixed on Brian as he gripped the wheel of the Ferrari, her eyes sparkling with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had parted ways with them after tying up loose ends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dying to know about my past, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's lips curved into a slight, teasing smile as he glanced at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's cheeks were flushed from the wine, a soft rosy glow spreading across her delicate skin. Her long hair danced gently in the breeze slipping through the open window, framing her in a way that was almost unfairly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs, clad in sheer black stockings, caught the faint glow of the dashboard lights, shimmering subtly. The sight sent a restless itch through Brian, a sudden urge to reach out and feel the silk beneath his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste tilted her head, a playful smile tugging at her lips. "Honestly? Before the Godfather sent me to work with you, I dug into your background. Compared to the other heirs, you seemed... Well, painfully ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you have no ambition and no vision. You threw away your shot at being the Godfather's heir for a woman, ran from your family, lost everything... And after you saved her, she dumped you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I read all that, I was beyond disappointed. I was convinced you'd never survive the Godfather's trial, that you wouldn't last a year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian listened in silence, his face unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she was right. The old Brian had been young, reckless, and foolish, making one bad call after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stole another glance at him, her voice softening. "But the more time I've spent with you, the more I've realized you're nothing like the guy in those files. You've got fire, strength, and... There's this air about you like you're hiding a thousand secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of something complex, curiosity, maybe admiration, crossed her stunning face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Truth is, I can't figure you out anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, her tone turning earnest. "When the Godfather paired me with you, our fates got tangled up. If we're going to fight for the position, I need to know you better, to be ready for what's coming. So... Will you tell me about your past?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's lips quirked into a faint, mischievous grin. "Sure, I'll spill. But only if I get something in return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something in return?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste arched a brow, her curiosity piqued. "Like what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, let me think," Brian said, feigning deep contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze slid deliberately to her legs, the black stockings catching the light just so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about... I get to know what those legs feel like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face flushed a deeper shade of crimson, her heart pounding under the weight of his stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, their eyes locked, the air in the car crackling with a subtle, electric tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that a yes, beautiful Ms. Hawthorne?" Brian asked, his voice low and warm, his eyes never leaving her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste squirmed under the intensity of his gaze, her confidence faltering. She ducked her head, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine... but you have to tell me about your past first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal," Brian said, a thrill of excitement sparking in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to give her a chance to back out, he added with a playful warning, "No dodging this time, alright? Don't pull that teasing stunt like last time, or I might just have to spank you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of Brian pinning her on the couch last time, his hand delivering a playful swat, sent a fresh wave of heat to Celeste's cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, saying nothing, but didn't pull away as Brian's hand inched closer to her thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his fingers drew near, Celeste's pulse raced, her breath growing shallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, too, felt his nerves hum with anticipation, his eyes fixed on the prize so tantalizingly close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, his hand settled on her thigh, the black stockings cool and silky under his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was electric. It was soft and smooth, with just a hint of chill, sending a rush through his veins.</span></p></div>
