        <h1>Chapter 88 Karen's First Time</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Karen's first time, and she hadn't expected it to feel so overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she gently took his member in her mouth, an emptiness inside her seemed to be filled, a sensation she'd never quite understood until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, she finally grasped why women in those porn seemed to enjoy it so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a tender kiss, she teased it with her tongue, feeling it swell and grow with every second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation brought her an unexpected pleasure, a strange sense of accomplishment that she couldn't quite explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Brian had acted so aloof and rejected her earlier only stirred her determination even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had started as an awkward attempt gradually became more confident, her movements flowing more naturally as she gently teased him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each passing moment, she grew bolder and took his testicles in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Heavens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's lips were soft, warm, and impossibly smooth, sending a wave of sensation through Brian that made him feel like he was floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at her, noticing the intensity of her attention, and a surge of power and pleasure washed over him, something he had never quite felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, this woman had been so proud and aloof, always looking down on him with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she knelt before him like a servant, carefully tending to his every need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to keep his cool, Brian barked, "You slut, stop this right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But rather than stopping, Karen only seemed to grow more determined in her devotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave Brian a disdainful look, her lips curling into a smirk. With a subtle shift, she cupped her full breasts and wrapped around his hardness, swaying her figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt as though he was completely enveloped in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Karen, the feeling was one of pure indulgence, the excitement sweeping over her. She couldn't help but let out soft, enticing moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... you're right, I... I'm a total slut...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so strong, so slippery...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian... please, say something... please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Karen was completely lost, all the desires she had kept hidden for so long pouring out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't hold back, eyeing Karen's eager expression. "Karen, you little slut. Do Sophia and your sister know just how desperate you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen didn't respond. Instead, she kept moving her body, more provocatively than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gripped her breasts with both hands, carefully holding his manhood, her head lowered as she sucked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The untouched, mysterious area had already grown damp, and moisture slowly began to drip from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian pulled out his phone, casually turning on the camera, his attention fixated on Karen's expression, which was growing more alluring by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think your family would recognize you if they saw you like this, Karen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words seemed to stir something within her, making her even more excited and animated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, you asked for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to suppress the fire in his heart anymore, Brian held Karen's head and started thrusting hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, waves of satisfied sounds and thrusting sounds came from Karen's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until she was having trouble breathing and her eyes rolled back that Brian stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen sat on the ground, gasping for breath, her face filled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body moved with each deep breath, her curves more noticeable with every slight shift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't tear his eyes away from the sight of her long legs encased in black stockings and the way her figure was so perfectly outlined by the tight skirt. His gaze burned with unspoken desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, aware of his stare, reclined on the floor, slipped off her heels, and casually began to run her foot along his penis in a slow, intentional motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her already soaked panties, Brian directly carried her legs on his shoulders, tore away her black stockings, broke through the thin hymen, and rushed into her that had already been filled with vaginal fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's brows knitted together, a soft, pained sigh escaping her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a wave of unexpected, intense sensation washed over her, each breath accompanied by a soft, breathy sound that slipped out unintentionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt as if he were enveloped by a warm, soothing current, like drifting through a gentle sea, weightless and carried by the flow...</span></p></div>
