        <h1>Chapter 124 Teasing Celeste</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Celeste said. "He and Thomas have started a new venture called Quadrillion Group. They've set up shop right across from Trillion Group's offices."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't suppress a chuckle at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't see what's so amusing," Celeste said with an exasperated sigh. "Denzel's backing them with considerable resources, and you know the Godfather won't lift a finger to help. How exactly do you plan to get the company through this crisis?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it. I have my plan" Brian said smoothly. "Just focus on developing and launching those three beauty products as quickly as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stared at him, taken aback. "You're not seriously counting on those products to turn this around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" Brian replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For heaven's sake, Brian, stop being so naive!" Celeste snapped. "Do you have any idea what will happen if Thomas pulls his investment? The stock will tank, and our cash flow will be decimated&mdash;we could be looking at bankruptcy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won't even have the capital to manufacture these beauty products."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took an elegant sip of his wine, seemingly unperturbed. "Just do as I ask. The funding won't be an issue&mdash;I'll handle that part."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll see about that," Celeste snorted skeptically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian reclined on the couch, his gaze wandering appreciatively over her figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was undeniably alluring, especially in that thin nightgown with nothing underneath&mdash;the outline of her nipples just barely visible through the fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's getting late. Why not stay the night?" he suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you think about sleeping at a time like this?" Celeste retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so dramatic. This is just a minor setback." Brian yawned and stretched lazily as he stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not staying, I'm heading to bed." He started toward the upstairs bedroom, then paused and turned back with a smirk. "Wear something nice to the office tomorrow&mdash;I want to see those stockings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt her blood boil. Here the company was facing an existential crisis, and he was thinking about her stockings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a withering glare before storming out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nearly collided with Damian outside the villa, who had apparently rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawthorne," he said breathlessly. "Did you tell Mr. Edwards everything? What did he say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste shook her head helplessly, recalling Brian's cavalier attitude. "He told me to stay calm&mdash;said it was just a minor setback."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A minor setback?" Damian's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Brian's reaction reinforced his suspicion that Brian must come from an incredibly powerful family to remain so composed in the face of such a crisis. Anyone else would be in a panic by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he just wants us to stick to our work," Celeste replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She studied Damian curiously. "Mr. Phillips, since Thomas managed to secure backing from someone as influential as Denzel, why haven't you joined them? You could jump ship and withdraw your investment too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawthorne!" Damian's expression was one of wounded dignity. "Do you take me for an opportunist?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "To be honest, I knew from the moment I met Mr. Edwards that he was extraordinary. After witnessing his handling of the shareholders' meeting, my admiration only grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" I'm convinced that under his leadership, Trillion Group will reach unprecedented heights. Yes, we're facing some obstacles at the moment, but I have complete faith in Mr. Edwards' ability to overcome them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My role is simply to follow his lead and contribute whatever I can. Please, if there's anything at all I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was stunned by the fervor of Damian's speech and his earnest expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd never seen this side of him before. Whatever spell Brian had cast over Damian, it had certainly inspired fierce loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's consideration, she replied, "Actually, there are several matters where I could use your assistance..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian listened intently to her requests, then thumped his chest confidently. "Leave everything to me, Ms. Hawthorne. I guarantee there won't be any problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Phillips," Celeste said warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Damian hurry away, Celeste fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Brian's casual dismissal of their troubles, she couldn't shake her concerns. She began making calls. Better to prepare for the worst, just in case.</span></p></div>
