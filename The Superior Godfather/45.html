        <h1>Chapter 45 The Second Largest Shareholder</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan shot up from the bed and scrambled to answer the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, why did it take you so long to pick up? I just landed. Come pick me up at the airport."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, you're back early?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of hope flickered in Ryan's previously dejected heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sam's connections, getting out of this mess would be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. I got a notice that the Master is reorganizing the War Deities, so I came back ahead of schedule. I'll introduce you to the Master someday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's excitement soared through the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Master of the War Deities was a superpower at the very top of the pyramid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan thought to himself, "If I can meet this legendary figure, my future will be nothing short of brilliant. My career will soar to unprecedented heights. A partnership with Trillion Group? That's nothing compared to the opportunity to meet the master of the War Deities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly replied, "Sam, hold on. I'm on my way to the airport!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Ryan rushed downstairs, grabbed Sophia, and spun her around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, we're going to be rich!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary frowned, their eyes filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan had just been thrown in jail, and the Carter Group was on the brink of collapse, yet Ryan was talking about getting rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary thought, "Has Ryan lost his mind from all this stress?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia also frowned in confusion. "What are you talking about? Put me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was still bubbling with excitement. "I'm not crazy. You have no idea... My cousin came back early from overseas!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He used to be a core member of the War Deities. And he's going to introduce me to the master of the War Deities! The Master&mdash;the top dog in the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Your cousin was a core member of the War Deities? And he's introducing you to the Master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, Robert, and Mary were equally shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the day, the War Deities had been one of the most powerful forces in the world, feared and respected globally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Master of the War Deities was a top-tier figure, second only to that legendary Godfather in terms of prestige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia thought, "Ryan's cousin is introducing him to the Master of the War Deities! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If Ryan can meet him, his future will be brilliant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious, Ryan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan replied without hesitation, "Absolutely! He came back early because he got a call to reorganize the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're looking for talents right now. With my talent, I'm bound to be useful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia dragged him toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's not waste any more time! Let's go pick up your cousin now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they hopped into their Bentley and sped off to Riverwood International Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at an exclusive top-tier club, Thomas Lee, Kevin's uncle and the second-largest shareholder of Trillion Group, was lounging on a sofa, enjoying the pampering and massages from a group of beautiful celebrities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a net worth of more than 10 billion dollars, he lived a life of extreme luxury, with beautiful women catering to his every whim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, his assistant burst in, looking flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lee, there's trouble! Your nephew Kevin has been arrested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas raised an eyebrow, his face expressionless. "Arrested? What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant quickly explained, "Celeste investigated and reported him secretly, accusing him of abusing his power, raping female employees, and taking bribes. The evidence is solid, and Mr. Wright has been detained for investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was stunned, shooting to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Kevin had been involved in numerous illegal activities together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kevin was investigated, he could easily get dragged into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Thomas smashed his wine glass to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare Celeste mess with my people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lee, Celeste wouldn't have the guts to do this on her own. From what I know, she must have been acting on the orders of the new chairman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' face turned ashen as he clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the new chairman trying to send me a message? Tell all the shareholders to come to the company for a shareholders' meeting tomorrow. I want to see just how formidable this new chairman is."</span></p></div>
