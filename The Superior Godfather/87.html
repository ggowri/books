        <h1>Chapter 87 Please Help Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Repay me with your body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's heart raced, and his eyes lingered on Karen's confident, mature presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected her to say something like this, especially considering she was his ex-wife's aunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't have anything left. I can't go back home, and I can't offer anything of value. The only thing I can give you is... myself," she said, her voice hesitant, but her eyes locked on his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you help me out, I'll be yours from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a desperate situation. If she couldn't pay the loan sharks, she'd be sold abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of what awaited her was enough to make her offer everything she had to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took a deep breath, trying to remain composed. He looked at her, cold and distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to break her pride, this woman who had once looked down on him, and make her submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know what you're saying, Ms. Jones?" he said flatly. "You're my ex-wife's aunt... don't you have any shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen felt a sharp pang of humiliation. His words, mocking and cutting, stung deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes filled with tears, but she kept looking at him, desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know exactly what I'm saying. Isn't that what you men like? The thrill of something forbidden?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I know it's shameless, but I have no other choice. Please, treat me however you want. Just help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ran her hand slowly over her figure, trying to summon some courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may be older, but I've kept in shape... and, well... I'm still a virgin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still a virgin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian froze, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen had never married, but he'd always assumed she had a complicated love life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He certainly didn't expect her to still be a virgin at 38.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned bright red as she spoke softly, almost ashamed, "Yes... I've just never been interested in men. I hated the way they looked at me, so I never had a boyfriend and never considered marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, if you help me, you'll be the only man in my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze remained cool. "Honestly, Ms. Jones, your offer is tempting... but I'm not the kind of guy you think I am. You should go home. I need to get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian turned and started walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen stood there, stunned, as though struck by a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined he would reject her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubt flooded her mind. Was it because of her age? Had she really lost all her charm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to enter the bedroom, Karen rushed forward. Without thinking, she threw her arms around him from behind, her voice trembling with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, please... help me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do anything you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stiffened, feeling the warmth of her body through the clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though there was distance between them, the sensation of her softness was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfume, a subtle, floral scent, reached his nose, and for a brief moment, he almost lost his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly regained control, determined to keep things in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jones, please. Think about what you're doing. Do you really know what this means?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, whispering, "I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm a desperate woman... Just let me serve you. I'll take care of everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, she leaned in, her lips pressing against Brian's neck. Her tongue traced a slow, deliberate path, sending a shock through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was unlike anything he'd felt before, leaving him breathless and suddenly aware of the heat building within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the weight of Brian's breath, Karen grew bolder. Her hands slid down his chest, her fingers exploring as she moved lower, eventually finding what had begun to respond to her touch. She caressed it gently, her movements more deliberate now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian struggled to keep his cool, his voice sharp. "Karen, what are you doing? Get off me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, she suddenly dropped to her knees in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly unzipped his pants and, with a determined look, moved closer, her lips parting as she reached for his hardness.</span></p></div>
