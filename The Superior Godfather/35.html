        <h1>Chapter 35 Seductive Beauty</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what else could happen? What do you mean by that, Rachael?" Brian asked, feigning confusion while trying to keep his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia tilted her chin and ran her tongue seductively across her lips, fixing Brian with a sultry gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, surely you know what I mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't. Could you be more specific?" Brian stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian suspected she was trying to seduce him, but he couldn't be sure and didn't dare make any assumptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things would get awkward if he misread the situation and made an inappropriate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I need to spell it out for you?" Anastasia purred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She traced her finger slowly down her neck and across her ample chest in a seductive gesture that made Brian's heart race and left him staring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath to calm his racing pulse, reminding himself to play it cool before responding with feigned innocence, "Rachael, I'm pretty slow regarding these things. I honestly don't understand what you're getting at... maybe you could give me a hint?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you'll be this dense about it, just forget it. Let's eat before the food gets cold," Anastasia said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how oblivious Brian was acting, she dropped her flirtatious demeanor, sat up straight, and resumed her usual aloof expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stood there dumbfounded, his hopes crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought Anastasia was flirting with him, dropping hints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been waiting for her signal, ready to make his move and show her a good time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was her response? Really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was messing with him, wasn't she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to speak, he felt something unexpected down below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down, he saw Anastasia's stockinged foot in her high heels brushing against his already excited member...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unfamiliar sensation nearly made his soul leave his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn, this woman knew exactly what she was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a second later, that beautiful foot quickly pulled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia looked at him apologetically. "Sorry, I think a mosquito was biting me. My foot accidentally touched you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading Anastasia's sincere apology and remembering that sensual moment, Brian couldn't tell if she had done it on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They said women were the most complicated creatures in the world, and Brian was now experiencing that firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced a smile and said. "It's fine. Let's eat before the food gets cold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, I'll dig in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile appeared on Anastasia's face as she relished the various dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it was pure enjoyment for her, it was torture for Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cooking was so delicious that Anastasia kept making happy sounds of satisfaction and amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the dishes were spicy today, Anastasia would occasionally catch her breath or fan her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was quite captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner and a short rest, Brian took Anastasia to the bedroom to treat her injured hip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please lie face down on the bed," Brian instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint blush appeared on Anastasia's beautiful face at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, she lay down and carefully removed her jeans to reveal her injured area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid yesterday's awkwardness, Anastasia had thoughtfully worn appropriate undergarments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This arrangement allowed Brian to perform the treatment while maintaining proper coverage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian found himself needing to maintain strict professionalism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm starting now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian forced down the desire surging in his chest, placed both hands on Anastasia's plump, round hips, and channeled his energy, slowly massaging her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant he touched her, the softness and incredible elasticity beneath his fingertips made his breathing quicken and his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Brian's touch, Anastasia felt waves of sensation coursing through her body, flushing her shyly. She couldn't help but let out a sweet, seductive moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That intoxicating sound sent a rush of heat through Brian's veins, making his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly pushed aside distracting thoughts, focusing solely on channeling his energy to heal her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, her moans only grew louder, sweeter, more alluring...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of desire welled up in Brian, compelling him with the urge to grab her boobs from behind and thrust vigorously into her tender pussy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But reason quickly forced him to regain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After half an hour, Brian finally ended the long, seductive session.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia lay on the bed, drenched in fragrant sweat and utterly spent, her body as limp as a puddle of soft flesh while her enticing mouth panted in heavy gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, the encounter was as much an indulgence as a torment.</span></p></div>
