        <h1>Chapter 72 Be Moderate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are not satisfied, shall we continue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Zoe glanced at Brian with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the recent incident, Brian had completely lost interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was exhilarating, getting caught would be embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't want a moment of greed to destroy his lifelong reputation. This woman was utterly insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cleared his throat and swiftly shifted the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's discuss business. Did you find anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's demeanor changed. She dropped her lazy, seductive expression and spoke seriously, "I've discovered something important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Through my investigation, I found that the assassin who killed your mother and the one who tried to kill Sophia three years ago belong to the same organization. They both bore a distinctive skull mark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Zoe handed a photo and a document to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, I believe their real target three years ago wasn't Sophia at all, but you! They exploited your weakness of caring for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared at the skull mark in the photo. "Have you traced the origin of this skull mark?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe shook her head. "I've scoured all the records and used all my connections, but found no clues. This force must be powerful and incredibly secretive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry. I'll keep investigating in secret. I'll inform you as soon as there's any news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded slightly and continued to inquire, "How is the recall of the War Deities' warriors progressing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The summons has been sent. The former warriors of the War Deities are on the way to Riverwood. The Four Lords and Twelve Blades are also on their way back, but it will take some time. Now, only Sam has arrived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe hesitated briefly before adding. "That call earlier was from him. He wants to meet with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he make the call?" As the memory of the earlier scene came to mind, his expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of all times, that bastard had to call right then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It nearly caused him utter embarrassment. Just the thought of it made him angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, "Make him copy the rules a thousand times, then come see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Zoe burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A thousand times? You are wicked! That bastard is really in for it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules were thousands of words long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Copying it a thousand times would be pure torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the most dreaded punishment among the War Deities members was copying the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like how primary school students dreaded homework.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Zoe told Sam the news, Sam was completely stunned. He sprang up from the sofa and looked at Zoe in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? The Master wants me to copy the rules a thousand times?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smirked and looked at Sam with sympathy. "Yes, and you'd better finish it quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's face was filled with grievance, and he was on the verge of tears. "Why? I haven't offended the Master in any way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked at him playfully. "Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really didn't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Sam could finish his sentence, he realized. "Could it be because of the phone call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not that dumb. Now, copy it. I've had a long day and need some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe stretched lazily, then turned and headed upstairs to the bedroom, leaving Sam bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated briefly, then found some paper and a pen, and started copying the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't dare to defy Master's orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process was long and torturous. He even broke two pens while copying. By the end, his hand was trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd rather fight battles than spend time copying rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when he had copied half and was breathing a sigh of relief, his phone rang. He picked up the phone and saw that it was Ryan calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was eager to know whether Sam had recommended him to join the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, how did it go today? Did you meet with the Master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam rubbed his aching hand and spoke calmly, "I was busy today and couldn't meet with the Master. I'll tell you by tomorrow. Just wait for my call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Sam picked up the pen and resumed copying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He copied the rules all night long and finally finished a thousand times, securing a meeting with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Sam with tired eyes, Brian frowned and asked, "Sam, what's wrong with you? Why do you look so worn out at such a young age?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Brian patted his shoulder and spoke earnestly, "Young man, you need to learn moderation. Don't indulge in beauty all day long, or your body will give out sooner or later!"</span></p></div>
