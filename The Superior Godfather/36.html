        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much for today, Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Anastasia quite a while to collect herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed red as she pulled up her pants, looking at Brian with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel her injury improving thanks to Brian's energy massage therapy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled, "You don't need to thank me. It's my pleasure to treat a beautiful woman like you. One more session, and your injury will be completely healed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more session?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia kept her head down, fidgeting with her finger in circles as her blush deepened, looking incredibly shy and attractive. "Then... I'll come back tomorrow to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to bear the awkward atmosphere, she got up and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but smile as he watched Anastasia's sensual figure walk away, remembering the intimate scene from moments ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he would win over this proud and capricious woman one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly remembering something, he quickly rushed after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia paused mid-step and turned to look at Brian. "What is it? Do you need something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hesitated before speaking up, "There's a big investment conference at the Trillion Group tomorrow night at eight. I'd like you to come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile played across Anastasia's lips. "I'd love to," she replied cheerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll pick you up then," Brian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following day, Brian woke early to prepare for the Trillion Group's evening conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to give Ryan a harsh reality check tonight and make Sophia regret betraying him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At seven in the evening, Celeste arrived at Brian's villa with a custom Burberry suit, a pair of bespoke shoes, and a limited edition Patek Philippe watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian transformed his appearance when he put on the suit and watch. He looked every bit the sophisticated gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt her heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look amazing!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I do," Brian replied confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is everything set up as planned?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste replied respectfully, "Don't worry, Mr. Edwards, everything is arranged. Ryan and Sophia will watch you become a partner in the Trillion Group, and they'll see Kevin and Ethan taken away by the police and prosecutors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded with satisfaction. "What about the car I requested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste quickly handed Brian a car key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The car is parked in the garage downstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took the key and drove away in a limited edition Pagani Huayra from the underground garage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes later, Brian pulled up in the Pagani at a villa's entrance and called Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, I'm here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll be right out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Anastasia walked out of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't returned to her estate last night to keep Brian from discovering her true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dressed to impress the investors at the conference today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair was elegantly styled in an updo, highlighting her flawless face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a custom-made white gown showing her tall, graceful figure. The dress' plunging neckline revealed a generous glimpse of her cleavage and fair skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overall look was both elegant and sensual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unique starry earrings and silver gemstone necklace added to her naturally sophisticated and regal aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the kind of woman any man would dream of having.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's beautiful face lit up with surprise and admiration at Brian's appearance today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look handsome today, and your car is so cool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My queen, you look beautiful and sexy today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian opened the car door for Anastasia like a gentleman, helping her into the seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they were speeding to the Plato International Hotel for the investment conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a luxurious villa across town...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, you look stunning today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, dressed in a custom black Armani suit, couldn't take his eyes off Sophia as she descended the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia smiled brightly and said, "Well, it's your big day to prove yourself as a Trillion Group partner, so of course, I had to dress up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan declared confidently, "Don't worry, I'm going to crush that loser Brian in front of everyone today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia wrapped her arm around Ryan's as they walked outside, saying, "I believe in you, and I trust my judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll wait for your good news at home. Don't forget to call us as soon as you get the results," Robert, Mary, and Anne said eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Trillion Group investment conference was too high-profile for them to attend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, Anne... just relax at home and wait for our good news," Sophia said with a gentle smile before getting into Ryan's Ferrari supercar and heading to the conference.</span></p></div>
