        <h1>Chapter 41 Confrontation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Sophia finally snapped out of their daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They glared at Brian with dark expressions, their eyes burning with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had barely opened their mouths when Celeste's voice cut in from the podium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you two! Would you mind getting out of the way? Everyone's waiting for Mr. Edwards to come up and speak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Sophia were so furious they could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They reluctantly shifted their legs aside to make a path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, folks!" Brian said with a slight smile as he calmly walked past them to the podium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kevin standing there in shock, Brian flicked his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burst of energy shot out and struck Kevin's knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin felt his knee buckle, and he dropped to his knees right in front of Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian quickly stepped forward to help him up. "Mr. Wright, what are you doing? There's no need to kneel. You're embarrassing me! Please, get up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's knee felt like it had shattered. The pain was so intense that his face contorted, and he remained kneeling, unable to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Brian with fierce eyes full of endless rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew damn well this bastard was behind it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the excruciating pain left him unable to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, please get up. You don't need to do this...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just a partner. There's no need for such a grand gesture."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian sighed and motioned for two staff members to help Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste walked over to Brian and handed him a microphone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, congratulations on becoming a partner of Trillion Group. How do you feel at this moment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a lot of feelings, and I'd like to thank someone special!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprise and curiosity flashed in Celeste's eyes. "Who would that be, Mr. Edwards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian fixed his gaze on Sophia and said self-mockingly, "That would be my ex-wife, Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave up everything to be with her back then. I even took several bullets for her and became disabled. But instead of showing gratitude, she had an affair with Ryan behind my back and forced me out with nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's only now that I've finally woken up and returned to being myself. That's why I want to thank her specifically!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have started Transcendent Construction Group, and I definitely wouldn't have become a partner in Trillion Group to prove myself again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent shockwaves through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Brian to have such a past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While many felt sympathy for Brian, they also couldn't help but admire him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man had bounced back from losing everything to defeat the Carter Group. It was truly remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people started hurling insults at Sophia and Ryan, the traitorous couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a slut! She's nothing but a shameless whore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ungrateful bitch! These two adulterous bastards deserve each other..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe Sophia turned out to be this kind of person. I feel sick knowing my company worked with hers before..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face turned pale as she listened to the accusations and insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected Brian to expose everything in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it spread, her reputation would be ruined, and she would never be able to show her face in their social circles again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly stood up to defend herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't listen to this bastard Brian's lies! He's making everything up! The truth is I caught him having an affair with Celeste. That's why I filed for divorce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the only reason he became a partner at Trillion Group is because Celeste abused her position as CEO to help him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting his reputation tarnished either, Ryan quickly jumped in to support her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia is right! Brian only became a partner at Trillion Group because Celeste abused her power. The shareholders and executives had chosen my company, the Carter Group, as their partner! Mr. Wright, the vice president of Trillion Group, can verify this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin fixed his hostile gaze on Brian and Celeste, his eyes flashing with cold malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw this as his perfect chance to destroy Celeste and force her out of the Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he declared, "Ryan is right. Trillion Group's shareholders and executives officially chose the Carter Group as our partner. I have the signed documents to prove it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Kevin pulled out the documents bearing the signatures of all major shareholders and executives and showed them to the Trillion Group executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to address them directly. "Guys, are these your signatures?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it true that our group chose Ryan and the Carter Group as our partners?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating, the Trillion Group executives responded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's correct. We did choose Ryan and the Carter Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sneer crept across Kevin's face as he got their confirmation, and he turned his piercing stare back to Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some nerve, Celeste! You've abused your power to help your little boyfriend...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The evidence is right here. What do you have to say for yourself?"</span></p></div>
