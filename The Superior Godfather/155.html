        <h1>Chapter 155 Lightning-Wielding Meta</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's face went rigid the moment he heard it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much for loyalty in times of trouble. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd believed Thomas and the others w</span><span>ould stick</span><span> by </span><span>him</span><span> when things got rough. But </span><span>the next thing he knew</span><span>, </span><span>they </span><span>hit him with a cold slap of </span><span>reality</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're pulling your investment?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I</span><span>t's not like we want to..." </span><span>they</span><span> looked helpless and frustrat</span><span>ed</span><span>. "But with how things are now, we </span><span>just </span><span>can</span><span>'t</span><span> keep this partnership going."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We really were </span><span style="font-style: italic;">hoping to share in</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">his success and enjoy the good life alongside him</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But he had to screw it all up at the worst possible time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Denzel's reputation was completely trashed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Online, he was practically public enemy number one. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they kept </span><span>sticking with</span><span> him, they would</span><span> not</span><span> just </span><span>go down with him</span><span>&mdash;they'd lose every cent they'd invested. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling out wasn't about betrayal; it was </span><span>survival</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Denzel felt a wave of resignation wash over him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he wasn't about to let go of that sweet deal with</span><span> them just yet</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, </span><span>he</span><span> spoke up, "</span><span>Look, </span><span>I get </span><span>it</span><span>, I do. But it's not as bad as you think. Just give me a little more time&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Thomas cut him off, "We understand you're in a tough spot. But please, try to understand ours as well... Just give us our money back, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another added, "Yeah, Mr. Denzel Vaughn, </span><span>j</span><span>ust return the money</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>L</span><span>et's not make this ugly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing </span><span>they had made up their mind</span><span>, Denzel had no choice but to tell them the truth. "</span><span>Guys</span><span>, full disclosure&mdash;I already put that money into the stock market. Even if I wanted to </span><span>give</span><span> it </span><span>back </span><span>now, I c</span><span>ouldn't</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that</span><span>, Thomas, Zac, Eric, and the rest turned pale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Denzel to gamble away their money</span><span> </span><span>without even telling them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glory Group's shares were in free fall, no bottom in sight. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The</span><span>ir</span><span> money was as good as gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Might as well have lit that cash on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions turned grim. </span><span>They </span><span>clenched </span><span>their f</span><span>ists tight and fixed him with an angry</span><span> glare</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them snapped, "How could you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another barked, "I don't care how you do it, </span><span>I just</span><span> my money back</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>oday</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under their </span><span>glare</span><span>, Denzel just shrugged and held his hands up in surrender. "Look, I</span><span> want to</span><span> give it back. But </span><span>you see</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>my hands are</span><span> tied. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about this&mdash;</span><span>just go home</span><span>. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll reach out the second I can pay you back, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, Zac, and the others </span><span>weren't buying it</span><span>. Their expressions darkened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew Denzel was just stalling. And waiting? God knows how long that would take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they snapped back, "No</span><span> way</span><span>. We're not leaving without the money today</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel had already been seething with anger, with nowhere to vent it. </span><span>Seeing them push like this made</span><span> his face turned utterly grim. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, </span><span>d</span><span>on</span><span>'</span><span>t push it. I</span><span>'</span><span>m trying to be nice here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and the others </span><span>tried</span><span> to say </span><span>more</span><span>, but Denzel cut them off</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victor, show them out</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he said that, </span><span>they</span><span> exchanged a look and then lunged at Denzel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Denzel, you heartless bastard! Give us our money back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really couldn't blame them for losing it like that. They had poured everything they had into this&mdash;years of blood, sweat, and sacrifice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing it </span><span>all now</span><span> meant</span><span> they'd be dead broke, just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's face hardened the moment he saw what was going on. He took a step forward, placing himself in front of Denzel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Try touching</span><span> Mr. Denzel Vaughn</span><span>, and you'll regret it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very next second, a burst of crackling energy surged out of Victor's body</span><span>.</span><span> Thomas, Zac, Eric, and the others </span><span>were slammed backwards</span><span>. They cough</span><span>ed</span><span> up blood</span><span> as they hit the ground hard</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Victor surrounded by streaks of lightning, Thomas, Zac, and the others went pale. Their eyes widened with shock and fear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"H-He's... a Meta?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Victor to be a Meta who wielded lightning elemental energy. </span><span>N</span><span>one of them dared to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel, meanwhile, stared them down</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>H</span><span>is expression </span><span>was </span><span>ice-cold</span><span> and</span><span> his gaze </span><span>was </span><span>filled with unmistakable intent to kill. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke slowly and clearly, "I was going to let you live, figured you might still be useful. But clearly, </span><span>I was wrong</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They</span><span> stiffened, a wave of panic hit them all at once. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Denzel Vaughn, we&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They </span><span>wanted</span><span> to beg for mercy </span><span>but</span><span> Denzel</span><span> didn't let them.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, </span><span>their</span><span> faces drained of color. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before</span><span> they turned to flee, Victor struck. In an instant, countless bolts of lightning surged from his body</span><span>. They</span><span> transform</span><span>ed</span><span> into massive serpents of pure electricity that lunged forward and swallowed </span><span>them</span><span> whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of screams then erupted through the room. Within seconds, they were reduced to charred husks beyond recognition. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bet </span><span>they never </span><span>saw that coming, even </span><span>in their wildest nightmares</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>T</span><span>oss them in the river. </span><span>Feed the fish</span><span>," Denzel </span><span>said like it was nothing</span><span>, not a trace of emotion</span><span> </span><span>in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were hauling out the bodies</span><span>, Denzel's phone </span><span>rang</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze darkened slightly when he saw Anastasia's name flash across the screen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> pressed to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Denzel, are you okay? I saw what's going on online&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before </span><span>she</span><span> could finish, Denzel </span><span>cut her off</span><span>, "Oh, spare me the crocodile tears. Don't act like you give a damn. </span><span>I</span><span> know you're the one pulling the strings behind all this</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You think y</span><span>ou're the only one </span><span>who knows</span><span> those </span><span>big shots</span><span> overseas</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p></div>
