        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Brian led the group to the Paradise Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no airs at the dinner table and mingled well with many shareholders and senior executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor made Thomas and Eric question his age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His various performances did not show that of a young man in his twenties. Instead, he was like an old veteran who had been in the business world for a long time and could handle all kinds of situations with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, Brian was the head of the War Deities, one of the world's top five forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were hundreds of thousands of members in the War Deities, and various industries were spread all over the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Managing the Trillion Group was easy for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, we have something else to do, so we'll leave now," Thomas and Eric felt uneasy watching Brian socialize with Damian and the others. After a while, they decided to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's enthusiasm remained unaffected by their departure, continuing to enjoy drinks and conversation with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end of the banquet, it was already one in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was staggering from too much alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste quickly moved to support him. "Mr. Edwards, be careful. Let me help you to your room to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she assisted him, Brian felt her soft touch against his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her huge breasts that pressed on his arms and were squeezed and deformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when they were walking, the pair of breasts pressed and rubbed against his arms, giving him a strong stimulation, making him drunk and blurry-eyed, feeling ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Celeste did not notice this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled to guide Brian to the presidential suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was much taller and heavier than her, and when she struggled to throw him onto the soft bed, she was already exhausted and out of breath, and she lost her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to inertia, she fell directly on Brian and pinned him under her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sexy, flaming red lips even kissed Brian's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An electric thrill coursed through her, leaving her momentarily frozen in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, in his drunken state, only felt a soft touch and sweetness coming from his lips. He subconsciously held her head and kissed her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, inexperienced of intimacy and taken aback, felt as if struck by lightning, her mind blank and unable to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Brian's tongue coaxed her lips apart that she regained her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was overwhelmed by the intensity of the kiss, letting out a soft, tantalizing moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to resist, a large and powerful hand grasped her breasts, kneading them playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mesmerized by Brian's warm touch and the intense sensations with each squeeze, Celeste felt her resolve weaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his tongue and hands teasing her, her cheeks flushed, her breathing quickened, and her eyes glazed with ecstasy. She momentarily forgot to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having also consumed some wine, she began to eagerly reciprocate Brian's passionate kisses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her enthusiasm spurred him on, and his hands moved from teasing her through her clothes to directly kneading her breasts, stirring her excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stimulation made Celeste tremble, and she responded with soft moans, fully immersed in the moment.</span></p></div>
