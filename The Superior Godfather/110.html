        <h1>Chapter 110 His Ex-wife's Best Friend</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden female voice startled them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked up and saw a young woman with heavy makeup and a pretty face walking in with an expensive bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian knew this woman. Her name was Eleanor Brooks, and she was Sophia's best friend. It was said that her boyfriend was a top rich man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brian was with Sophia before, Eleanor often belittled him and made sarcastic remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing her words, the salesgirl who was responsible for receiving Brian hesitated for a moment and said apologetically, "Ma'am, I'm really sorry. This dress and stockings have been reserved by this gentleman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Eleanor frowned. Her eyes fell on Brian, and a hint of surprise flashed in her eyes. She just felt that he was a little familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, as if she thought of something, she smiled coldly. She looked at Brian with a playful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, it's you, loser. You're dressed so well that I almost didn't recognize you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're something. You got a new woman so soon after being dumped by Sophia. She's young and pretty. I guess she's a poor college student who hasn't seen the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the dress and stockings she's wearing are not something a poor bastard like you can afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you know what's good for you, ask her to take off the dress immediately and leave with her. Otherwise, you'll embarrass yourself here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian glanced at Eleanor coldly and ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his head and said to the salesgirl, "Don't worry about her. Please continue to help my friend choose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian dare to ignore her like this, Eleanor felt greatly insulted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She crossed her arms in front of her chest, looked down at Brian, and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk! You are still pretending in front of me, loser? Continue to choose? I'll wait and see if you can afford them in the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she actually sat aside and waited to see Brian make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian ignored her. He was interested in watching Celeste put on various styles of clothes and stockings, which made him happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor had to admit that Celeste, who was wearing various styles of clothes and stockings, was really amazing and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a completely different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Brian were with her, she would wear a different outfit and stockings every day, just like changing a girlfriend every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply a different experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Eleanor feel ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered where Brian, the poor bastard, had tricked such a beautiful poor college girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was very satisfied with the clothes and stockings Celeste tried and said to the salesgirl without hesitation, "Pack up all the clothes and stockings she tried on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words came out, the salesgirl was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Celeste tried more than 30 sets of clothes and stockings of different styles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each piece was a luxury item, and all of them cost a lot of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor couldn't help laughing and looked at Brian as if she were looking at an idiot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pack up everything? Brian, do you think you are buying cabbage in the market?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how much these clothes and stockings cost in total?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not talk about other things. Just one pair of stockings costs about four thousand dollars. Can a poor bastard like you afford it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't afford it? Are you talking about yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Eleanor with disdain. He took out his bank card and handed it to the salesgirl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Swipe the card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, are you still pretending? Do you think I don't know your financial strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor sneered, "Swipe the card? Let me see how long you can pretend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that Brian's bank card could not have so much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the next second, he paid successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her stunned gaze, the salesgirl handed the bank card and a brand new platinum membership card to Brian with her managers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Edwards. Your total spending this time is 9.86 million dollars. Here is your receipt. In addition, our company has issued a platinum membership card for you, a premium customer, for free, which you can enjoy a variety of benefits. Please keep it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eleanor saw Brian surrounded by the managers and listened to their conversation, her mind went blank, and she stood frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian's bank card can actually pay 9.86 million dollars at one time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fact had brought her a huge shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It overturned her understanding and made it difficult for her to understand and believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't understand where Brian got so much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of salesgirls in the store opposite had been paying attention to their movements, ready to see Brian make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, they all widened their eyes and looked incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the salesgirl who mocked Brian for not being able to afford them. Her expression was like seeing a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, their stockings could also be tried on. It was just that she thought Brian was a poor bastard and couldn't afford them. So she said that on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never expected that Brian was actually a hidden rich man who could spend nearly 10 million dollars at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted it very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she missed a top guest in her career, a top order in her life, and a great opportunity to get rich.</span></p></div>
