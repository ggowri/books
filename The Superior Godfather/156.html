        <h1>Chapter 156 Velmara in Maid Outfit</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Anastasia froze on the other end of the line, completely baffled. "I don't know what you're talking about, Denzel. What overseas investors? I've never even met anyone like that. This has absolutely nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, still pretending, huh?" Denzel let out a sneer, a cruel smile tugging at the corners of his lips. "Fine. Just wait. I'll make sure we settle this, every last bit of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he hesitated for a long while before finally dialing a mysterious number on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">At this point, that damn guy is the only one who can pull me out of this mess. If I want to survive this and secure my future, then screw it. I'll just have to go all in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the call connected, a disgustingly sweet and overly flirtatious voice came through the speaker. "Denny, darling, you've finally come around, haven't you? You're ready to say yes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overly sweet, cringe-worthy tone made Denzel's stomach churn. Swallowing back the nausea, he clenched his jaw and forced out the words. "I'll agree to date you. But you have to help me with three things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person on the other end giggled. "Three things? Honey, I'd do a hundred things for you. Now go get yourself all cleaned up and come to my estate later. Don't worry, I'll make sure you're taken very good care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the call ended, Denzel couldn't hold it in anymore&mdash;he ran to the side and threw up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor, seeing this, looked visibly concerned. "Mr. Denzel Vaughn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel waved him off and spoke hoarsely, "I'm fine... Get me a fresh set of clothes. I'm heading out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor frowned. "But&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel cut him off immediately, "Just go!" He was genuinely afraid that if he waited any longer, he'd change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside a luxurious villa, Anastasia stared at her phone in silence after the call ended, a trace of helplessness and bitterness creeping across her flawless face. She couldn't believe Denzel had pinned everything on her, acting like she was the mastermind behind it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This seriously has nothing to do with me. But... if Denzel wants to pin it on me, maybe that's not such a bad thing. At least it'll make people think I've got someone powerful backing me, and they'll be too scared to make any moves against me for now. Still, who's actually helping me behind the scenes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Anastasia's father, Herbert, called. "Anastasia, you little rascal. You've really been keeping secrets from your old man, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked, confused. "What are you even talking about, Dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on," Herbert said. "You're still playing dumb? Just tell me who's that foreign investor backing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words only made the bitter smile on Anastasia's face deepen. She quickly tried to clear things up. "Dad, I swear, I don't know any foreign investor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert chuckled, "You're still pretending? If you don't know one, then tell me why some overseas capital would suddenly step in to help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with his question, Anastasia could only force herself to stay patient as she explained everything, though deep down, she felt completely helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Herbert frowned deeply, feeling utterly confused as well. "You really don't know him? Then why would someone go out of their way to help you? Could the person secretly backing you be Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian?" Anastasia paused for a moment before shaking her head. "He's a decent guy, sure, but he doesn't really have the foundation or means to pull something like that off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert looked even more puzzled. "Then who could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia replied, "I don't know either." She thought for a moment and then added, "I've already had someone look into it. Hopefully, I'll get the chance to thank him in person one day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert said, "Oh right, do you know how the family handled Denzel after finding out about all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of curiosity crossed Anastasia's expression as she asked, "What did they do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert explained, "The family usually doesn't interfere in fights between you successors, but that video of his really embarrassed them. Your grandfather gave him a week to clean up the mess and fix the fallout. If he can't, he's out as a successor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Well, looks like he's got his hands full now. Maybe I can finally take a breather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then get some proper rest. I'll let you go for now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Anastasia stared at the steadily rising stock price of the Anastasia Group and fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who's the one helping me behind the scenes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, the weather was beautiful&mdash;clear skies and warm sunshine. Brian, still fast asleep, was rudely awakened by a loud, frantic knock at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stumbled over and opened it, only to find Velmara standing there in a maid outfit that made her look adorably petite and almost absurdly sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze drifted to her chest, where the tight fabric barely held back her soft, smooth curves, and he instinctively swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara's small frame paired with her big juicy breasts in this getup was an absolute knockout. The white lace cuffs around her wrists and the thigh-high white stockings gave her an extra dose of playful charm, with just enough flirt to knock a man's brain offline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Brian's attention was quickly pulled away by the three massive packages she was struggling to hold up. With his brow furrowed, he asked, "What are you carrying, Velmara?"</span></p></div>
