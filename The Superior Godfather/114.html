        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Olivia gave the order, hundreds of thugs were about to move in when Celeste suddenly said, "Throwing us in the river to feed the fish? My, my, Paul, you're quite full of yourself, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar voice caught Paul off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been so focused on Patrick's injuries that he hadn't paid attention to Brian and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had dismissed them as mere insects not worth his notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he realized Celeste and Brian were standing before him, his pupils constricted, and his face changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined Patrick had picked a fight with these two untouchable figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Celeste was the CEO of the Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Brian might appear to be a partner at Trillion Group on the surface, rumors suggested he was the company's newly appointed chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the kind of people Paul knew he couldn't afford to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly shouted at his thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, stand down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the thugs froze in their tracks, looking at Paul with confusion written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick and Eleanor stared at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia frowned and asked, "Paul, what are you trying to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul ignored them and strode quickly toward Brian and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could take more than a few steps, Olivia grabbed him by the ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, I'm talking to you!" she snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, you've got the hots for that little tramp because she's pretty, is that it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul felt utterly humiliated and shouted at Olivia, "Damn it, let go of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of releasing him, Olivia tightened her grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you yell at me, Paul!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our son gets beaten up like this, and instead of helping him, you're defending that tramp! You better tell me straight! Are you sweet on that little hussie or what? Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Olivia could finish, Paul violently wrenched her hand away and slapped her across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth, you witch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SLAP!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden sound of the slap stunned everyone at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Paul and Olivia in complete shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weren't they supposed to be here backing up Patrick?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did they end up fighting among themselves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick and Eleanor stood there looking completely lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul... you slapped me because of that slut?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia clutched her stinging cheek, tears welling in her eyes, a look of utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul had always treated her like a queen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, he had always been the typical henpecked husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet today, he slapped her in front of everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul ignored her and quickly walked over to Brian and Celeste, his face filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne... my foolish son has caused you trouble. I'm here to apologize on his behalf. Please accept my sincere apologies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then bent down and gave Brian and Celeste a deep bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden gesture stunned everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all watched Paul with utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Paul, owner of the Paul Group and a big shot in Riverwood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, humbling himself like an ordinary man and bowing to this young couple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was equally shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their brains seemed to short-circuit at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell was going on here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had Paul suddenly done 180 and started apologizing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Brian watched Paul calmly, offering no immediate response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earlier, I told your son that even if you showed up, you'd have to kneel and apologize to me. But he not only refused to believe it, he threatened to kill me once you arrived and said he'd sell Ms. Hawthorne to a brothel as a prostitute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Paul's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined his son could be such a complete bastard, so outrageously bold as to threaten to sell Celeste into prostitution!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could destroy the Paul Group with a single phone call!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat broke out on Paul's forehead as he dropped to his knees in front of Brian with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne... this is entirely my fault for failing to raise him properly. I promise I'll discipline him severely when we get home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he whipped his head around and barked at Patrick, "You ungrateful bastard! What are you standing there for? Get over here and apologize to Mr. Edwards and Ms. Hawthorne immediately!"</span></p></div>
