        <h1>Chapter 44 The Master of the War Deities</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At ten-thirty in the evening, the Evans Villa was decked out in a riot of flowers and balloons. The dining table was laden with fresh blooms, a cake, and champagne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa was brimming with festive cheer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, it's all set," Robert, Mary, and Anne said with smiles on their faces. "Sophia and Ryan will be so surprised when they get back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had put a lot of thought into the celebration, wanting to make it special for Ryan and Sophia's success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doorbell rang, and they exchanged excited glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be Sophia and Ryan," Robert said. "Let's get ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They grabbed confetti poppers and rushed to the door, ready to surprise the couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surprise!" they shouted in unison as the door swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the startled looks on Sophia and Ryan's faces quickly turned to irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, what on earth are you doing?" Sophia snapped, clearly not in the mood for surprises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just wanted to celebrate!" Mary, unaware of their upset, said with excitement undimmed. "Look at all this! We've got cake and champagne. Come on, let's have a party!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell us, Sophia," Anne urged. "How was the Trillion Group's event? Did Brian's face drop when you became partners?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia and Ryan exchanged a glance, and their dejection was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you guys looking like that?" Robert asked, finally picking up on the tension. "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan didn't say a word. He just turned and headed upstairs, his shoulders slumped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Passing the dining room, he saw the table set with flowers, cake, and champagne. In a fit of rage, he swept everything off the table, smashing it to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it. He'd lost the partnership to Brian, and with Ethan arrested and the Carter Group on the brink of collapse, he was at his wit's end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert, Mary, and Anne stood there, stunned, unsure of how to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Ryan stormed upstairs that they could breathe again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, tell us what's going on," Mary pleaded, taking Sophia's hand. "Why is Ryan like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne urged, "We are family. Just tell us what happened. Let's deal with it together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're in trouble," Sophia said, her voice tinged with bitterness. "We didn't get the partnership. Brian did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert, Anne, and Mary's jaws dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? That good-for-nothing Brian? Are you kidding me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's useless! How could Trillion Group choose him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't Kevin help Ryan? Aren't they friends? How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face turned even more sour. "Kevin and Ethan have been arrested for corruption. We're completely ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news hit them like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe things had turned out like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now?" Anne asked, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia was at a loss, her face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her and Ryan's scandal exposed, many of the Evans Group's partners were backing out, plunging the company into crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Ethan behind bars and the Carter Group on the verge of collapse, she had lost her support completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt utterly helpless now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going out for a bit," Anne said after a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to talk to Brian, to beg him for mercy and a chance for the Evans family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upstairs in his bedroom, Ryan's phone kept ringing, but he just stared at the ceiling, too numb to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never expected that he would end up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd tried everything to get Ethan out on bail, but nothing had worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to switch off his phone and have a good rest when it rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he sat up, his eyes widening in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his cousin Sam Carter, calling from overseas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam wasn't just a successful angel investor. He was also a powerful Meta, a former member of the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ryan could get his help, maybe there was a way out of this mess.</span></p></div>
