        <h1>Chapter 169 Hero to the Rescue</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian sidestepped a slashing machete with fluid grace, his fist rocketing forward in retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow landed with devastating force, snapping the thug's ribs like dry twigs. Blood sprayed from the man's mouth as his chest caved in, and his insides ruptured. He crumpled to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Brian spun into a flawless sidekick, his heel connecting with another goon's neck. The crack of bone echoed as the man was sent flying, tumbling dozens of yards across the bridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Willy seized the moment, charging at Brian with a wild swing of his machete, aiming for his skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes glinted with icy resolve. Channeling a surge of energy into his right hand, he caught the blade mid-air, his grip unyielding under Willy's horrified stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flex of his fingers, he crushed the razor-sharp steel into fragments, the metal splintering like glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift motion, Brian snatched a jagged shard of the broken blade and flicked it across Willy's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sickening sound of flesh tearing filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Willy's pupils shrank to pinpricks, his hands clutching his slashed throat as he staggered, choking on his own blood. "This... How is this possible? You... You're a Meta?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words dissolved into a gurgle as he collapsed, his life pooling beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden roar of an engine cut through the chaos. Hector, the driver, had seen enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panicking, he gunned the Toyota straight at Brian, screaming, "Die, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He floored the accelerator, the van surging forward with lethal intent. Brian had no time to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Karen's heart stopped, her eyes wide with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bound hand and foot, she was helpless, forced to watch as the vehicle barreled toward Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening crash rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector and Karen stared, dumbfounded, as Brian planted his hands against the hood of the oncoming van, stopping it dead in its tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The engine roared like a beast, tires screeching and smoking against the pavement, but the vehicle didn't budge an inch, no matter how hard Hector slammed the gas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? This can't be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector's face was a mask of disbelief, his voice trembling as if he'd seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Refusing to accept defeat, he kept his foot on the pedal, but the engine groaned and sputtered, finally giving out with a loud bang as it seized up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze was cold, unyielding. With a single punch, he shattered the driver's side window, reached in, and yanked Hector out like he weighed nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you can't do this! I'm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector's desperate plea was cut short as Brian's hand closed around his throat, lifting him effortlessly. With a flick of his wrist, he hurled Hector over the bridge's railing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector's scream echoed through the night, a wail of despair that faded as he plunged into the dark, churning river below, swallowed by the current.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian watched the scene unfold, his face an impassive mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These lowlifes had pushed him too far. He wasn't the type to play nice with scum like them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned to leave, something caught his eye inside the van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity piqued, and he yanked open the door and climbed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be kidding me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His jaw dropped when he saw the woman bound inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Karen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ropes only accentuated her stunning figure, her curves straining against the restraints. Her chest, full and prominent, seemed ready to burst free and paired with her breathtaking face, she was a vision that could tempt anyone to cross a line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's mouth was sealed with duct tape, her muffled cries barely audible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian wasted no time, peeling the tape off gently and working to untie the ropes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he freed her, his hands inevitably brushed against her soft, alluring body, sending a spark of heat through both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the ropes fell away, Karen let out a shaky breath, her eyes brimming with gratitude as she looked at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, thank you. You've saved me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, his voice tinged with concern. "What the hell happened here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen glanced around nervously, her voice low. "This isn't the place to talk. Let's get out of here first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded, helping her out of the van and leading her away from the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they moved, he pulled out his phone and fired off a quick text to Sam, instructing him to bring a crew to clean up the mess.</span></p></div>
