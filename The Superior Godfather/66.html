        <h1>Chapter 66 Ecstasy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the presidential suite, the air was thick with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian and Celeste intertwined tightly together, lost in pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden rip, Celeste's dress tore, revealing her breasts in sexy red lingerie and a deep cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of her skin intoxicated Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hastily removed the red lingerie, cupped her large breasts, and eagerly sucked on them, alternating between gentle pulls and teasing with his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such strong stimulation from him, Celeste felt her whole body go soft as if she were about to melt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to respond enthusiastically, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding Dong! Ding Dong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, room service!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden ringing of the doorbell brought Celeste back to her senses from the brink of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She jumped up from Brian like a frightened rabbit, covering her plump breasts and breathing heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time for her to have such close contact with a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling made her feel fresh, exciting, and thrilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Brian remained asleep, she felt completely relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the crazy behavior, her cheeks turned red, and her heart beat wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she frowned, very dissatisfied with her behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had almost given herself to this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the sleeping Brian, she murmured, "I'll only give myself to you if you're strong enough to earn my approval, which you clearly aren't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything that happened just now should be considered as a reward for your performance today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Straightening her clothes, she pressed the do-not-disturb button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after the housekeeper left did she look at Brian again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was undeniably handsome and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, the tough attitude and methods he displayed tonight when facing many shareholders and senior executives overturned her understanding and perception of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was a completely different person at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the real Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this was true, then maybe he could pass the Godfather's test, regain the qualification of the heir, compete with those heirs for the position of Godfather, and reach the top of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was not a bad choice for her to follow the Godfather's orders and come to assist Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled sweetly, leaning over to remove Brian's shoes and undo his shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Brian's muscular body and perfect Apollo's Belt, Celeste was slightly stunned and felt her heart beating rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect his body to be so strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft gaze, she stroked his cheek and whispered, "Brian, you've impressed me a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I look forward to seeing what you'll do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she tucked him in and turned, her sexy figure swaying as she left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Sophia and Ryan were in high spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Brian's partnership with the Trillion Group threatening the Evans and Carter Groups with collapse, the return of Ryan's cousin, Sam, brought renewed hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's identity was very extraordinary. He was not only a core member of the War Deities but also the Unparalleled Blade, one of the Twelve Blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past two days, Sophia and Ryan had been trying to please Sam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they finally got Sam's approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam said, "Ryan, you're doing great. You've matured a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master is reorganizing the War Deities, and he needs talents. When I meet him tomorrow, I will do my best to recommend you to him and let you join the War Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Sam," Ryan replied, thrilled by the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face turned red because she was too excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Ryan gained approval from the Master, he would join the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, their status would be improved dozens or even hundreds of times, which could be said to be a step to heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, if they want to crush Brian to death, it would be as easy as stepping on an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've had a lot of fun these past two days back home. You guys are so thoughtful. Go back and wait for my notification," Sam added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should rest early. We will take our leave first," they said as they left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't wait to tell the good news to Ethan in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they departed, Sam, dressed in a white suit, looking gentlemanly and noble, called Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Zoe's charming voice came from the phone. "Sam, have you arrived in Riverwood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam replied, "I arrived two days ago for personal matters and didn't contact you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Sam continued, "How is the Master now? If possible, I would like to see him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll mention it to him tomorrow, but I can't promise he'll agree to meet you," Zoe said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam replied, "Thanks, I'll treat you to a drink sometime."</span></p></div>
