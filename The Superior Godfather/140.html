        <h1>Chapter 140 Shocked Them</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden male voice startled everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under their shocked gazes, some bodyguards in black, exuding a strong aura, rushed in and stood respectfully on both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian walked in accompanied by Zoe and Sam. His imposing aura enveloped the room. Everyone present was shocked, and a hint of horror flashed across their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone couldn't help but exclaim in his mind, "Brian has such a terrifying and powerful aura."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The employees of Trillion Group present were all the trusted subordinates of Celeste and Damian. They greeted Brian excitedly. "Mr. Edwards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Damian smiled, felt relieved, and stood up to greet Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded slightly at them, walked to the main seat at the front, and then sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam and Zoe stood respectfully behind Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's indifferent gaze swept over everyone and then landed on a man in a gray suit. He said coldly, "Just now, you yelled that you were going to smash this place, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in a gray suit was Dyer Butler. He only felt a sudden overwhelming pressure bear down on him, making his face turn pale. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He explained awkwardly, "Mr. Edwards, you've misunderstood. I... I was just joking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian sneered and turned to look at Celeste. "How much money does the company owe him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste replied, "Mr. Edwards, he took on the development project of Gretel International. The total construction cost is one billion dollars, but the project has not been completed yet. Only 70% of it has been finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After hearing the news that the company's capital chain was broken and it was on the verge of bankruptcy, he was worried that he wouldn't get paid after the project was completed. So he led the workers to go on a collective strike and came here to cause trouble, demanding the project payment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He breached the contract first, and some of the project payment was deducted for not completing the project as required by the contract, so we should pay 490 million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Celeste's report, Brian nodded, handed a bank card to her, and then looked at Dyer. "Give him 500 million dollars. The extra 10 million dollars is his medical expenses. Draw up a contract and ask him to sign it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Celeste had someone draw up the contract and present it to Dyer. "Mr. Butler, you can get the payment after signing the contract."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confirming that there was no problem with the contract, Dyer picked up the pen and signed it. Soon, he received the 500 million dollars transferred by Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Dyer was feeling puzzled about the extra 10 million dollars in medical expenses, Brian's cold voice rang out. "Break his limbs and throw him out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Two bodyguards in black suits rushed out and pressed Dyer onto the table. Then, Raven held a hammer and came to Dyer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dyer's eyes were full of horror, and his expression changed drastically. He quickly begged for mercy, "No! I was wrong, Mr. Edwards. I don't want the 10 million dollars. Please spare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood why there were 10 million dollars in medical expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Raven swung the hammer and struck down continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dyer's limbs were broken, bleeding profusely. Then, he was dragged out of the conference room by the bodyguards amidst his shrill screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bloody scene frightened everyone present into silence, and their eyes were full of fear towards Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted and Galen were frightened. They couldn't help swallowing, thinking Brian was really ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was calm as if he had done a trivial thing. He glanced at everyone. "I heard from Celeste that you are all here to terminate the cooperation and demand the cooperation payment. Is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian's oppressive gaze, those people simultaneously turned to look at Ted and Galen. After all, the two of them were the ones who took the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted and Galen's faces turned pale, but they didn't show any intention of backing down. One of them stepped forward and said, "Yes. We are here to terminate the cooperation and demand the cooperation payment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian narrowed his eyes. Just as he was about to speak, Farrah rushed in and reported, "Mr. Edwards, Ms. Jenkins, the president of Queen's Construction Group, is here. She wants to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Invite her in." A hint of helplessness flashed across Brian's eyes. He didn't expect that Thomas and the others had exposed his identity as the president of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought, "Presumably, Aria must hate me now for deceiving her with a shell company before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Aria walked into the conference room with her secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her, Brian smiled, "Nice to see you, Ms. Jenkins. You're not here to terminate the cooperation with me and demand the cooperation payment, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he hadn't known Aria for a long time, he had a pretty good impression and feeling of her. He could understand if Aria came here for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of mockery and playfulness flashed in the eyes of Ted, Galen, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's answer stunned everyone present. "If I wasn't here to terminate the cooperation with you and demand the payment, could I be here to flirt with you?"</span></p></div>
