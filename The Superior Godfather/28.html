        <h1>Chapter 28 Anastasia's Purpose</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bathroom, a generous flow of white liquid filled the sexy purple lace lingerie. The fire in Brian's heart gradually faded, and he let out a long, deep sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Anastasia's undergarments to affect him so powerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After washing the lingerie and returning it to its original place, he dressed and left the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he entered the living room, he saw Anastasia sitting gracefully on the couch, savoring a glass of red wine. Her flawless profile caught his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bathrobe had parted to reveal her long legs, which drew his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was truly stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire being was like a perfect jewel, without a single flaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and walked over. "How are you feeling? Any better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia took another sip of wine and replied with feigned calmness, "Much better, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian was about to speak, the doorbell chimed clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of confusion crossed his face. Still, before he could move to answer it, Anastasia was already heading to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she opened it, a striking woman carried a garment bag. She had short hair and sharp features, and her tall frame was wrapped in a black suit that emphasized her calm, professional demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here are the clothes you requested, Ms. Vaughn," she said, handing the bag to Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Eliza Gray, Anastasia's most trusted bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian perked up at her arrival. He could tell this beautiful bodyguard was incredibly skilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza froze momentarily when she took in Anastasia's current state and Brian's presence, surprise and confusion flickering across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things were moving pretty fast between Anastasia and Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But wasn't Brian supposed to be powerless now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had things turned out like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia calmly took the garment bag from Eliza and headed toward the bedroom, calling over her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My old clothes are in the bathroom. Please collect them and take them back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Miss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza nodded briefly and walked straight to the bathroom, passing Brian on her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt awkward and guilty as he remembered what he'd done with Anastasia's underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Anastasia emerged from the bedroom wearing a custom black lace gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black dress was simple yet elegant and sexy, perfectly complementing her noble and aloof demeanor. She looked like a queen, untouchable and distant, straight out of a TV drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her commanding presence was a complete transformation from the shy, vulnerable woman lying in bed earlier, and Brian couldn't help but be struck by her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I've got things to do. I'm heading out," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave Brian a cool glance before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza quickly followed behind her, carrying the clothes she had changed out of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Anastasia's retreating figure and thinking about her sudden cold attitude, Brian let out a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man, that woman sure can turn on a dime," he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Eliza escorted Anastasia back to her residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a luxurious estate that made the Riverside Villa No. 9 pale in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing she did upon returning was bathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she soaked in the enormous tub, memories of Brian treating her wounds blushed her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God, this is so embarrassing," she muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She splashed the water playfully with her hands, swaying back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked absolutely adorable, like a little girl throwing a tantrum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfect figure was on display, creating waves across the water that made for quite an alluring sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, she changed into a black outfit and returned to her usual elegant, aloof demeanor as she entered the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vaughn, Mr. Vaughn called, asking when you'll be home. He's very worried about you being out," Kale reported respectfully, having waited for her arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, Anastasia said, "Tell him I'm still evaluating Brian, and I'll return once I'm done. By the way, what else did my father say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grave look flashed in Kale's eyes. "Mr. Vaughn also mentioned that the family's heirs secretly track your whereabouts. They'll likely discover your connection to Brian soon...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, they'll stop at nothing to prevent you from allying with Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's face darkened at these words as she clenched her hands tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Competition within the Vaughn family was fierce, with five heirs vying for power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was one of these five heirs. Only by standing out among them could she become the leader of the Vaughn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Failure in this competition would lead to devastating consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had initially sought out Brian because she needed his help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she learned that Brian had lost his energy and become powerless after saving Sophia, she felt deeply disappointed and even considered breaking off their engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as she spent more time with Brian and got to know him better, she gradually changed her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She discovered that Brian wasn't useless. He was pretty talented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she decided to continue evaluating him for a while longer. This man could help her become the leader of the Vaughn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Anastasia asked, "How is your investigation of Brian going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a complete mystery," Kale replied with a bitter smile. "I've used every resource at my disposal, but I can't find any information about his past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A captivating smile played across Anastasia's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Well, that makes him all the more intriguing to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vaughn, I heard about you and Brian from Eliza..." Kale hesitated, leaving his words hanging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyebrows furrowed slightly as she responded with forced calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I simply took a fall and had to clean up at his place. That's all there was to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a relief..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale let out a deep breath, but before he could continue, Anastasia cut him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough. Don't ask questions you shouldn't. Go back to work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resigned smile, Kale bowed respectfully and left.</span></p></div>
