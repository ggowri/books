        <h1>Chapter 58 Desperate Karen</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At six o'clock in the evening, in the Trillion Group headquarters conference room, the shareholders and executives, led by Thomas, wore grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been waiting in the company for a whole day, and now it was already past the end of get off work time, but the chairman had not yet arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Celeste, who hung up the phone, Thomas asked in a deep voice, "Ms. Hawthorne, what did the chairman say? When will he come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked at Thomas and said calmly, "The chairman said to keep waiting. If you don't want to wait, you can withdraw your shares and resign."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had anticipated Brian's intention to use this opportunity to assert his authority, so she had to support him unconditionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as they exchanged incredulous looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had called this meeting to pressure the chairman for answers and to settle scores for Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Brian ignored them completely and did not take them seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Thomas feel powerless and frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysterious chairman proved to be more challenging than expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As everyone prepared to leave, Celeste reminded them, "Of course, the chairman also said if any of you don't want to wait any longer, you can leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once you leave, you won't have to come back again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's expressions darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas clenched his fists in anger and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed the chairman inwardly, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the luxurious villa, the air was thick with the stench of alcohol, and beer bottles littered the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne looked at Karen, who was drinking alone, her concern was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Karen, what's going on? Why are you drinking so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Karen was ten years older than her and was her aunt, the two had a good relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time she saw Karen, who had always been strong, drowning her sorrows in alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With bitterness etched on her beautiful face, Karen whispered, "I've been fired from the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How is that possible?" Anne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen had been a valued employee at Queen's Construction Group, earning nearly a million dollars a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everything went well, she would be promoted to head of the human resources department next year and become a senior executive of the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she was fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face twisted in anger and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "It's all because of that jerk, Brian. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have been fired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, shocked again, pressed for details. "What happened with Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen recounted the story, her frustration palpable. "I don't understand how Brian managed to charm Aria into treating him so well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a thought struck her. "Anne, I heard Sophia's new boyfriend is the CEO of the Carter Group. Tell her to help me get a job there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's expression darkened. "I'm afraid that won't work. The Carter Group is on the verge of bankruptcy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The Carter Group is going to go bankrupt?" Karen's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? It is the leader in Riverwood's real estate and construction industry. I even heard that they are very likely to reach a cooperation with Trillion Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne said helplessly, "It's a long story...but it's all because of Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen asked, "Because of Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne nodded and recounted how Ryan and Brian had competed for the Trillion Group partnership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Now, Brian is a partner and being hailed as a future star of Riverwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan and Sophia couldn't bear the blow and haven't returned home for a day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Karen was frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "How did Brian, that loser, become a partner of Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she finally understood why Aria treated Brian with such respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the villa door burst open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mikael Dunn entered with a dozen strong men in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were professional debt collectors for loan shark companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jones, it's time to settle your debt," Mikael announced.</span></p></div>
