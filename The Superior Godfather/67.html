        <h1>Chapter 67 Kevin's Shock</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at Lee Villa, Thomas and Eric sat silently on the sofa after leaving the Paradise Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the uncle and nephew were sitting on the sofa with grim expressions, not saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of today's experience, Eric's face turned grim, and his fists clenched in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain his anger, he slammed a cup on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cup shattered, and Eric's angry roar rang out in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, that jerk, transferred me to the publicity department. What's the difference between this and asking me to go home?" Eric shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas raised an eyebrow and said coldly, "Those who achieve great things don't care about trivial matters. It's just a transfer to the publicity department. Can't you calm down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down? You've seen how arrogant Brian was. How can I stay calm? Today, we have completely lost face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's fists tightened, his eyes filled with fury and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could imagine how others would look at him with mockery and ridicule when he arrived at the company tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric added, "Thomas, have we ever faced such insults? Are you really going to let him take charge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas replied calmly, a glint of wisdom in his eyes, "He is no fool. He only showed a bit of skill and managed to impress Damian. Even I feel uneasy around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that he's gained momentum, we must wait for the right moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Trillion Group is mine, and no one will take it from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a cold light flickered in Thomas' eyes, and he crushed the cup in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he had thought of something, he continued, "Also, please help me go to the prison and explain the situation to Kevin. Ask him to wait patiently for a while. I will think of other ways to get him out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll see Kevin right away," Eric replied, leaving with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, he arrived at the prison with his lawyer to meet Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few days, Kevin had changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a prison uniform, looking pale and bruised, as if he had been beaten and drained of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Eric, he felt like he had seen a savior. He quickly grabbed his hand and spoke excitedly, "Eric, you're finally here! Can I get out of this hellhole?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric said, "Kevin, it's complicated. I'm afraid you'll have to stay here a bit longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's words hit Kevin like a shock, and fear flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to stay here any longer and be raped again by those damn prisoners in the middle of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, his expression suddenly became extremely excited, and he yelled at Eric, "Why? Didn't you say you would come and get me out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down, don't get excited. It's a long story," Eric said, his face tense as he explained the incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To put it simply, the investment conference was a trap set up by that bastard Brian. In fact, he is the new chairman of our company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was shocked, and he looked as if he had seen a ghost, letting out an inappropriate sound. "What did you say? He is the new chairman of our company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, and he's even had me transferred to the publicity department," Eric confirmed. "But don't worry, Thomas is determined to take down Brian to help you. Just hold on a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Kevin started, but Eric interrupted, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, you have to endure for now. Trust me and Thomas. We'll find a way to get you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Eric turned and left with his lawyer.</span></p></div>
