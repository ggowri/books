        <h1>Chapter 79 Jumping off the Building</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ryan watched Sam respectfully bow before Brian, his mind went blank, struck as if by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... how is this possible? Brian, this bastard, is really the Master of the War Deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everything Ryan thought he knew was turned on its head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's position as the chairman of the Trillion Group had already left him stunned, but he never imagined Brian was also the legendary Master of the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was the man who stood atop the world's social pyramid, the one he had idolized with fervent admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan had once dreamed of being recognized by the Master, joining the War Deities, and gaining the power to exact revenge on Brian, crushing him beneath his heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with the revelation of Brian's true identity, he realized just how na&iuml;ve, absurd, and utterly pitiful that dream had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan thought, "So, all this time, have I merely been a joke to Brian? A pathetic little clown?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, an overwhelming bitterness filled Ryan's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked down at Sam, his gaze sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, on the other hand, wore a frosty expression, her voice like ice as she addressed Sam, "Is this the talent you were going to present to the Master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam stammered, cold sweat running down his forehead, "Uh... Master, this was a mistake. Ryan is not a talent at all... Please, punish me for my failure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shaken, never expecting such a monumental blunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Ryan still collapsing there like a deer caught in headlights, Sam's frustration boiled over. He swung his hand once more and slapped Ryan across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get a grip, you idiot! What are you standing around for? Hurry up and apologize to the Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's eyes burned with anger as he grabbed Sam's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was frantic, disbelief etched across his features. "This can't be happening! It's impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, you must be mistaken! How could Brian, the loser who I stole his wife from, possibly be the Master of the War Deities? You've got this all wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, please tell me this is a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can't be the Master! Come on, just say it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam felt his patience fraying at Ryan's refusal to accept reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect that this little bastard would be so ignorant of the current situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, it's not a mistake!" Sam spat, irritation boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of rage, Sam slapped Ryan hard across the face, sending him staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You clueless fool! Get back here and apologize to the Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp pain jolted Ryan back to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Brian, the shock on his face indescribable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the realization hit him hard, and he completely snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crumpling his hands around his head, he pointed at Sam and Brian, his laughter echoing off the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha... are you kidding me? How could he be the Master of the War Deities? I'm the true Master of the War Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, you peasants better bow to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peasants, don't you get it? When I command you to bow, you should obey! Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's face darkened, a menacing glint flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to teach this fool a lesson. But just then, Ryan started to back away, panic-stricken as he pointed ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't come any closer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great-grandmother, is that you? Are you here to get me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it seemed Ryan spotted something&mdash;or someone&mdash;outside the balcony, and his expression shifted from dread to an eerie calm as he locked onto the figure he believed to be his great-grandmother waving at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no hesitation, he barreled through the glass doors of the balcony, leaping off as gasps erupted from the crowd below. Tragically, Ryan landed directly in the path of an oncoming vehicle, which sent him flying dozens of feet away, his insides smashed beyond recognition as he died on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden scene caused an uproar in the restaurant, stirring up chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, however, remained impassive, his expression entirely unphased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe rolled her eyes, exasperated. "That's how he goes down? Seems a bit too easy for that bastard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I'm so sorry! I never anticipated it would come to this and ruin your meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take care of it right away," Sam said, his voice trembling with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian replied calmly, after a moment's thought, "No need, Just have someone call Sophia's family and have them come to collect Ryan's body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was genuinely curious to see how Sophia's family would react upon discovering Ryan's lifeless form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, I'll handle it right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam felt a wave of relief wash over him and hastily departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he left, a tall figure sporting sunglasses and striking white hair, accompanied by an older gentleman, entered the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel, upon spotting Brian dining with Zoe, broke into a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way toward the private room upstairs and pulled out his phone to call Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, I just arrived at the restaurant. Are you on your way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Denzel, just a moment! I'll be there shortly."</span></p></div>
