        <h1>Chapter 127 Lord of Wealth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and his associates stood in stunned silence, their faces darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Brian to make such bold threats&mdash;and what was more unsettling was their apparent powerlessness to counter them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been just one shareholder withdrawing, the impact would have been minimal; they could easily find a buyer to maintain the share value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with nearly every shareholder except Damian and Celeste pulling out, it was a different story. Finding enough capital to cover such a massive buyout on short notice would be nearly impossible, and the share value would plummet accordingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they refused Brian's lowball offer, news of the mass withdrawal would inevitably leak, triggering market panic and sending their shares into freefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit them like a physical blow: Brian had outmaneuvered them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll count to three," Brian said with a cold smile. "If you haven't signed by then, get out. One, two..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before he could reach three, Thomas and the others finally broke. "Fine," they spat through gritted teeth. "We'll sign!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's smile took on an edge of mockery. "Oh? I'm afraid I've changed my mind. Weren't you all so eager to withdraw your shares? Let's handle this through the proper corporate channels and procedures."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Thomas and the others' faces turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The standard process would take at least a month to complete the share withdrawal. Unless they could somehow secure capital to facilitate the transfer within that timeframe&mdash;a near-impossible task&mdash;they were trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Don't push your luck, Brian," Thomas warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or what?" Brian's smirk never wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Thomas opened his mouth to respond, Brian cut him off with a sneer. "I'll make you one final offer. Fifty percent below market value. Take it or leave it&mdash;but decide quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of tense silence, they capitulated. "We'll sign," Thomas muttered, his expression black as thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed they might be taking a loss now, but once they reinvested in Quadrillion Group, they'd more than make up for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've used every penny in the company's accounts to buy us out," Thomas noted with a vindictive laugh. "Trillion Group doesn't have a cent left for operations. Enjoy watching your shares become worthless when the company goes bankrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his group turned to leave, Thomas paused at the door. "By the way, we've set up Quadrillion Group in the building right across the street. A grand opening is in three days. You'll be getting an invitation&mdash;do try to make it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count on it," Brian replied with a meaningful smile. "I'll bring you quite the surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking forward to it. And good luck dealing with this mess," Thomas said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter echoed as he departed, followed by a contingent of company executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of the mass shareholder exodus spread like wildfire, throwing Trillion Group into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Thomas and his allies fanned the flames, spreading rumors of imminent bankruptcy. Even employees who had been waiting to see how things played out began demanding immediate resignation and final pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian and Celeste exchanged helpless looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards," Celeste said, "we've used all our liquid assets on the share buyback. With this wave of resignations and immediate salary demands, we're completely tapped out. If this continues, they'll tear the company apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the two of them had collected a lot of money, it was still far from enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian casually produced a bank card and handed it to Celeste. "Two billion dollars. That should cover it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste gaped at him, stunned that he could produce such an astronomical sum at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's eyes widened. "Two billion dollars, produced without a second thought," he thought. "Mr. Edwards' family must be even more powerful than I imagined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards," Damian said carefully, "this will cover salaries and keep us operational for about a month. But without new funding, the company will face bankruptcy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," Brian said with an easy smile. "Fresh capital will be in place within the month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"New funding?" Celeste and Damian exchanged shocked looks. "You've already secured new investors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's only response was a smile</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the War Deities' Four Lords and Twelve Blades, each had their designated role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara, the Lord of Wealth, controlled the War Deities' vast financial resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Velmara arrived in Riverwood and reunited with Brian, the full wealth of the War Deities would be at their disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the office door burst open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callian Efron, the head of security, stormed in with a crowd of guards and employees in tow, brushing past Farrah Tatum's attempts to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian!" Callian shouted. "We're done&mdash;we want to resign, and we want our wages, now!"</span></p></div>
