        <h1>Chapter 21 Sugar Mama</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call connected quickly, and an impatient voice came through the receiver. "Who the hell is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's voice was cold. "Mr. Knox, this is Ryan. Didn't I ask you yesterday to take care of Brian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that kid is still alive and well. You're a big name in this business. Surely, you're not the kind of man who takes the money and doesn't do the job, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Raven heard Ryan's voice, he was already fuming. The humiliation he'd suffered last night and the punishment he'd received from Zoe still stung. Now, hearing Ryan's complaint sent his rage over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some damn nerve bringing that up! You son of a bitch! If you wanna die, don't drag me down with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up. If you don't wire me the rest of my money today, you'd better tell your old man to start planning your funeral. Got it?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ryan could say a word, Raven slammed the phone down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan stared at the disconnected call, his face pale, his mind reeling from Raven's furious outburst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his grim expression, Sophia frowned. "Babe, what did he say? Did he not go after Brian yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face was dark, his lips twitching as if he wanted to speak but hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say something! What's going on?" Sophia pressed impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan exhaled sharply. "I don't know if he went after Brian or not, but he lost his temper at me and demanded the rest of his payment. Said if I don't send it, my dad should start preparing my funeral."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent. Then, Sophia, along with her parents, exploded with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those damn thugs! They took the money and didn't do the job, and now they still have the audacity to demand more? Do they really think we're pushovers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, however, seemed more thoughtful. "Dad, judging by Raven's reaction, I'd say he did go after Brian, but something must've gone wrong. He must've suffered a loss, which is why he was so furious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean to tell me even Raven couldn't handle that brat? He's a high-ranking member of Shadow Fang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan frowned, his expression darkening. "Anne might be right. It's not impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's voice turned cold. "So, what do we do now? Are we just going to let him off the hook?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him off? Not a chance." Ryan clenched his fists, a sinister glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cousin is coming back from overseas in a few days. He's a Meta. Taking care of Brian will be as easy as crushing an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian wants to challenge me for the partnership with the Trillion Group? Killing him now would be too easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd rather let him live just long enough to watch me win. I want him to see, with his own eyes, how I become the official partner of the Trillion Group at the investment conference. And then, I'll crush him in public and humiliate him in front of everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's eyes lit up. She wrapped her arms around Ryan, pressing herself against him with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, you're absolutely right! If he doesn't witness your success firsthand, it just wouldn't be as satisfying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want him to understand that I made the right choice. Compared to you, he's nothing but worthless trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary burst into laughter, nodding approvingly at Ryan's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anne frowned slightly. Something still didn't add up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated but still asked, "Sophia, have you ever thought about where Brian got the money to buy a villa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's smile stiffened. She had been so caught up in anger that she hadn't given it much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Anne brought it up, she felt uneasy. How had that broke loser suddenly become rich enough to buy a villa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could think further, Ryan sneered, "Oh, come on. You don't actually believe he bought that villa with his own money, do you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had to guess, I'd say he latched onto that rich woman he was with earlier. She's probably his sugar mama and bought the villa for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he said it, everyone in the room had an epiphany.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That woman Brian had been with earlier, her looks, her aura, her outfit, everything about her screamed wealth and class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Brian really was just leeching off her, it would explain everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's expression twisted in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sighed, shaking her head in disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And here I thought the kid had finally done something with his life. Turns out, he's just a pathetic freeloader. That woman must be blind to be wasting her money on a loser like him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian is nothing but a spineless good-for-nothing! I can't wait to see what kind of humiliation he faces at the investment conference. Let's see what he's got to compete with Mr. Carter!"</span></p></div>
