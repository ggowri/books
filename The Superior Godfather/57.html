        <h1>Chapter 57 Shareholders' Meeting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Aria's hot body, Brian's desire intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was not a man who liked to force women, so he smiled and joked, "So I misunderstood. Ms. Jenkins, I thought you might thank me with your body. I got so excited...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to suffocate me to death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words and looking at his penis, she recalled how she had just caressed it with her hands and blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, she wanted to disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having never experienced such intimacy before, her mind was blank at the time and she was driven entirely by the instinctive desires of her body. She only came to her senses later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she didn't know what to do and could only whisper an apology to Brian, "I, I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian found her shy demeanor surprising and teased her, "A simple apology? What if I suffocate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria, resembling a flustered girl, kept apologizing. "Mr. Edwards, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though usually composed and sophisticated, she was clearly inexperienced in intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian noticed her embarrassment and chuckled, "Ms. Jenkins, you've never had a boyfriend, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, she admitted, "I've been too busy managing the company. So I really have never had a boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian acted as if reprimanding a wayward student. "I see. But you must be more careful in the way you treat others in the future. Don't act like you did today to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, if it were anyone else, they wouldn't let this opportunity slip by."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at her figure and added, "But I must admit, you have a hot body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Aria realized her disheveled appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly covered her breasts, blushing. "Turn around, don't peek!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian reluctantly withdrew his gaze and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a rustling sound was heard behind him. Aria was getting dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the passion they had just had on the sofa, Brian felt a sense of unsatisfied desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was a chance, he must explore her even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Aria tidied her clothes and looked at Brian's back. Thinking of the passion she had just had with him, a complex look flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave her first kiss to this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, steeling herself to regain her composed presidential demeanor, and said, "Okay, you can turn around now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian turned to Aria, surprised by the sudden shift in her demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This woman's temperament changes so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now she looked like a girl who had made a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she has changed into a high and mighty president."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone changed as he said, "Ms. Jenkins, don't worry. What just happened was a misunderstanding, and I won't take it to heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's discuss our cooperation. I plan to assign your company to the Trillion Group's development project in Weston. As for the profits, how about we split it in a thirty to seventy ratio?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was surprised. "Thirty to seventy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. I'll take thirty percent and you'll take seventy percent." Brian nodded, clarifying, "If you feel it's not enough, we can adjust to a two to eight split, considering your company's contributions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had assumed the split meant she took thirty percent and Brian took seventy percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected it to be exactly the opposite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian even offered her more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This completely overturned her cognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other companies would only give her thirty percent of the profits at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would be like Brian to give her seventy percent or even eighty percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was too generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria hurriedly said, "Mr. Edwards, you misunderstood. I didn't mean that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm surprised you're offering so much profit. Most companies would only give us thirty percent or even twenty percent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled and spoke in a very generous manner, "Others are not me. I don't like to make things difficult for women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially for a beautiful woman like you. So, it's settled: a twenty to eighty split, with twenty percent for me and eighty percent for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria said, "No, Mr. Edwards, you got the project. It's not right to split it this way. A forty to sixty split is more appropriate at best. Forty percent for me and sixty percent for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several rounds of negotiation, they finally agreed on a fifty-to-fifty split.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much, Mr. Edwards. I've booked a restaurant to show my gratitude," Aria said, her eyes filled with appreciation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This project could yield her company at least 10 billion dollars in profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to respond, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Celeste. "Mr. Edwards, are you done with your work? The shareholders and executives are waiting for you in the conference room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow, displeasure flickering in his eyes. "Let them wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up and headed straight to the restaurant with Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he wanted to take this opportunity to temper the arrogance of the shareholders and senior executives of Trillion Group and give them a warning.</span></p></div>
