        <h1>Chapter 109 Stockings Show</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste paused and turned to look at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared at Celeste's long legs and nodded. "Yes. Today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh... I haven't decided what to wear today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes flashed, and she looked at Brian with interest. "How about you come with me to pick? You can choose any style."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian immediately became excited when he heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a real benefit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said without hesitation, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't help but laugh and teased, "Didn't you just say you were going to take a nap? What? Are you not sleepy now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said seriously, "When did I say I was going to take a nap? I clearly said I was going to get ready to work. You must have heard it wrong. Wait. I'll get ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Celeste's response, Brian quickly ran upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile on Celeste's face became even bigger when she saw this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wanted Brian to make progress, she had to give him some benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Brian changed his clothes and walked down from upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a white striped shirt and a pair of royal blue slim-fit trousers. He looked energetic and handsome. And at the same time, he had a hint of nobility and elegance, which made Celeste's eyes light up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really looked good in anything he wore. He was so handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Let's go buy stockings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian waved his hand and took Celeste to the shopping mall in the city center. He pointed to several different styles of stockings and said, "This. This. And these. Try them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the salesgirl was slightly stunned. She looked at Brian as if she were looking at an idiot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, sir. Our stockings do not provide try-on services!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No try-on services?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian frowned immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Celeste to buy stockings just to see her try them on. If she couldn't try them on, what would he see?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, clothes could be tried on. Why couldn't stockings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was somewhat depressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered which idiot made this rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian's depressed face, Celeste couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The salesgirl saw Brian's look and couldn't help but flash a hint of sarcasm and ridicule on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Stockings don't provide try-on services. And our stockings are also quite expensive. One piece costs at least a thousand dollars. Why don't you go to other stores?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian could speak, the salesgirl said sarcastically, "The store opposite can provide try-on services. But its price is more expensive than ours. I'm afraid you can't afford it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian glanced at her coldly and went to the store opposite with Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome. How can I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This salesgirl seemed very enthusiastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian asked, "I heard that your stockings can be tried on, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The salesgirl smiled and nodded. "Yes. Sir, do you want to buy stockings for this beautiful lady?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded. "Yes. Please introduce them to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's appearance surprised the salesgirls, but when they saw her legs, they couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow. This lady's legs are so beautiful, even more beautiful than those of professional leg models."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had seen countless beautiful socialites and models, but they were far inferior to the woman in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially her beautiful legs, smooth, slender, and straight, without the slightest flaw. Everyone was envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the salesgirl's recommendation, Celeste changed into a slim white dress with a pair of white stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she walked out of the fitting room, Brian was amazed. He stared at Celeste for a long time and could not come back to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his impression, Celeste often wore a red dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the long white dress with white fishnet stockings had changed her image and temperament drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a fairy from heaven, full of fairy spirit and a cold, pure, sacred temperament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a strong urge to conquer her, which made Brian's breathing quicken and his mouth go dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other salesgirls in the store were also stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was so beautiful and stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially her legs, set off by white stockings, were extremely sexy and eye-catching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do they look? Do I look good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't come back to his senses until Celeste's voice rang out. He nodded subconsciously. "Yes. You look good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said to the salesgirl, "Miss, please help me wrap up this dress and stockings..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Brian was interrupted by a feminine and mean voice before he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, I like this dress and stockings. Please help me wrap them up."</span></p></div>
