        <h1>Chapter 14 Seductive Charms</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unusual sensation on Brian's thigh sent his heart racing. He quickly replied, "I... I definitely like someone like you, Ms. Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's a relief," Anastasia said, her smile widening as she pulled her silk-stockinged foot back from under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but watch as she withdrew her foot, a strange feeling of longing and loss washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help imagining how incredible it would be if Anastasia used her foot to pleasure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the change in his expression, Anastasia's lips curled into a teasing smile. "Mr. Edwards, may I have this dance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's heart soared as he bowed gracefully and extended his hand to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia returned his smile and placed her hand in his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the elegance of a true gentleman, Brian led her to the center of the dance floor. He wrapped his arms around her delicate waist, and they began to dance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they moved, their bodies inevitably brushed against one another, sending a thrilling jolt through Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of Anastasia's perfume intoxicated him, and he found himself imagining how wonderful it would be to have her beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Anastasia was equally affected by Brian's strong presence. His masculine energy and graceful dancing stirred something deep inside her, and she found herself drawn to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the dance ended, their connection had deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I think we're friends now. You can call me Rachael," Anastasia said, her voice warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you can call me Brian, not 'Mr. Edwards'," he replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they left the bar, it was already 11 PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian offered to take Anastasia home, but just then, a Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up next to the curb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale stepped out and opened the door for Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Brian, her smile playful. "Brian, where do you live? Should I drop you off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian shook his head. "Rachael, there's no need. You go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's stay in touch," Anastasia said, giving him one last smile before getting into the car and disappearing into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian stood there, ready to hail a taxi, he realized he didn't actually have a place to stay at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to check into a nearby five-star hotel and buy a villa the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as the chairman of Trillion Group, money was the least of his concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he'd showered and settled into bed, Zoe called him on video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video, Zoe's tousled waist-length hair framed her face. She was dressed in nothing but a seductive black lingerie set, lying on a white bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cleavage was partially exposed, and her long legs were wrapped in black stockings, displaying her fiery figure. Looking at her, Brian felt his heartbeat quicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master," Zoe purred, her voice a blend of charm and complaint, "I miss you. I can't sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiggled her legs and pouted at the camera, looking desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you? Can you come keep me company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly dry as he watched her sultry appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fought to hold back his growing desire and finally said, "You're one of the War Deities Twelve Blades. Can you please be serious for once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Serious?" Zoe raised an eyebrow. "How?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know how, Master," she cooed, her eyes flickering seductively as she licked her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands wandered to her chest, and she moaned softly. "Please, teach me... I can't stand it anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master... Please teach me how to be serious. I... ah... oh, ah, hmm... I can't take it anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I... I want it so much... ah... Master, come and fill me up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's breath grew heavier as her enticing words echoed through the call. He couldn't resist the pull of his desire any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told the seductive woman his room number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine," he muttered. "Room 5008."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be right there, my dear master," Zoe said, her smile tinged with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, Brian's doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door, Zoe practically threw herself into his arms, and her body pressed against his as she pulled him toward the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a second, she pushed him onto the couch in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly shed her black coat, revealing the revealing black lingerie bodysuit underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tall, curvaceous figure was like a work of art, stunning Brian and setting his pulse racing.</span></p></div>
