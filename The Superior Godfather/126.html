        <h1>Chapter 126 Brian's Threat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The luxurious villa's great hall was packed with Trillion Group's shareholders and executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas stared at his phone, his face darkening as the dial tone faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's audacious outburst had caught him completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Thomas?" Eric broke the silence. "What's wrong? What did Damian say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zac and the other shareholders turned their attention to Thomas, who replied grimly, "He's refusing to join us. Says he's sticking with Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement sparked an immediate buzz of conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has Damian lost his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's always been unpredictable, but this is something else. If he wants to go down with Brian and Trillion Group, I say we let him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on&mdash;Damian's always been careful. Could he know something we don't? Does Brian actually have a way out of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric let out a derisive laugh. "Turn things around? How exactly does anyone expect that failure to manage that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got Mr. Vaughn backing us. Brian can't possibly compete with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if any of you are getting cold feet, now's the time to back out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders exchanged glances and quickly jumped to protest their loyalty. "Eric, how could you suggest such a thing? We're completely committed to you and Mr. Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! What could Brian possibly use to fight against you and Mr. Vaughn? This plan can't fail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. We definitely believe in Mr. Eric Lee and Mr. Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas nodded with satisfaction. "Well then, let's pay our useless chairman a visit, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Thomas and Eric led their procession of shareholders into Brian's office, they stopped short at an unexpected sight: Brian, Celeste, and Damian were casually playing cards over coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have they given up completely?" Thomas thought. "Have they accepted their powerlessness to change anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smirk, he said, "Brian, quite the carefree chairman we have here. The company's in crisis, and you're playing cards?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, is this really someone worthy of our loyalty and service?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hardly," Eric scoffed. "With leadership like this, Trillion Group can only decline and collapse. That's why I'm resigning and withdrawing my shares."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zac took a leisurely puff of his cigar. "Count me in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of agreement followed. "Me too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having known this was coming, Celeste and Damian couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The simultaneous withdrawal of so many shareholders and executives would be devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Brian maintained his composure. He casually tossed a stack of documents onto the table. "I accept your withdrawals and resignations. Here are the share transfer agreements and resignation forms. Sign them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His nonchalance stunned Thomas and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd expected pleading, perhaps even begging&mdash;not this cool efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they examined the share transfer agreements, their faces darkened. Brian was offering to buy their shares at a 40 percent discount to market price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the meaning of this?" Thomas demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took an unhurried sip of coffee. "It's quite simple. If you don't like my buyback price, you're welcome to sell your shares on the open market. I'd be curious to see who'd be willing to buy them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, Zac, and the others wore extremely sulky expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications hit hard. Once news broke of their mass withdrawal, Trillion Group's market value would likely halve or even collapse entirely. Their shares would become practically worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Thomas began, his face twisted with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian cut him off. "Before I change my mind and lower the offer further, you better sign them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At worst, we will all lose. Remember, until this transfer is complete, we're all in this together. Whatever happens, we share in it."</span></p></div>
