        <h1>Chapter 47 Dominant Possession</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's breasts were plump, soft, and very elastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt wonderful, especially when she licked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plenty of fluid seeped out from the glans, making her breasts softer and smoother. Anne felt hot inside and quickened her movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Anne was not satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She poured the lubricant on Brian's erection and her feet, wrapped in black stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she sat on the coffee table and clamped Brian's huge cock with her feet covered with lubrication, stroking it gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, God..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gasped, overwhelmed by the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he could no longer suppress the desire. He suddenly pushed Anne down on the coffee table, squeezed her plump breasts, entered her already wet area, and began to pump hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, so good. It feels so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the repeated impact, Anne lost herself in lust and let out sexy moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she even screamed, "Daddy, be faster. Daddy, it's so big. Harder..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her moans inspired Brian. He held her sexy waist and thrust into the deepest place inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Semen gushed out, filling Anne's tender vagina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, so good! I feel it inside me. It feels great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the hot semen in her vagina, Anne flushed with excitement, her body trembling violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up weakly and licked the semen remaining on Brian's penis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flirty words came out of her lips. "Daddy, come on. Let me clean your cock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her provocative words and sexy look aroused Brian again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His penis erected again, becoming extremely hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Anne's head with both hands and started thrusting without hesitation...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Brian was fast asleep when a sudden, intense sensation jolted him awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled back the covers and looked down, only to find Anne licking his erection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This woman is really insatiable," Brian thought to himself, looking at Anne's delicate face and the way her breasts moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fucked her eight times last night, but she was still not satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her exquisite face and the beautiful breasts swaying, Brian felt excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rolled her beneath him, grasped her ample, round breasts, and thrust into her pussy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passionate encounter lasted for over an hour before they finally collapsed, exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne lay there, panting heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had filled the void she had felt for years after being widowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the doorbell rang sharply, startling Anne and making Brian frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to ignore it, but his phone rang at that very moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hushed Anne and answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I'm at your door. Aren't you home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian paused for a second before lying, "I'm not home. I'm out getting groceries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? When will you be back? I'll wait for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt a headache coming on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated and then said, "It'll be a while. Why don't you grab a coffee nearby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. I'll wait for you at the caf&eacute;."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Anastasia's footsteps fade away, Brian let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want any misunderstandings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Anne. "Get your things and leave. My friend will be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes flashed with a hint of resentment, and her heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew their relationship was nothing more than a transaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She silently got dressed and turned to leave, but Brian called out to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful not to run into my friend. I don't want any trouble..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Anne lunged at him, pinning him to the bed and kissing him fiercely, her hands running over his penis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's words had ignited her jealousy and possessiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was determined to claim him completely.</span></p></div>
