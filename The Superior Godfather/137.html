        <h1>Chapter 137 Surprised Brian</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Brian finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne put on her clothes, looked up at Brian, and said seriously, "I'm with you not coveting your money or power. I just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before she could finish her words, Brian pulled her into his arms and joked, "I know. You're coveting my body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Anne blushed. Just as she was about to get angry, Brian said, "Ahem, don't be mad. I'm just kidding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Brian looked at Anne's charming and beautiful face affectionately. "I was wrong about what happened last time. I'm sorry. I hope you won't take it to heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne came to visit Brian when everyone else thought his company was on the verge of bankruptcy and encouraged him in her way. It made Brian fully understand her feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of how he had threatened her and made her hide in the cabinet before, he couldn't help feeling a bit guilty, so he apologized to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, I forgive you." Hearing this, Anne raised her chin slightly with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking of Brian's situation, she felt anxious, and her smile faded. She said with a look of self-blame, "I'm sorry. I can't help you when you're in the most difficult time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian pinched her chin, admiring her delicate face, and smiled, "Silly girl, didn't you just help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Anne's cheeks were crimson. She was about to say something but was interrupted by Brian, "What in this world could be more important than a sincere heart? Anne, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Brian lowered his head and gently kissed her rosy lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time that Anne felt Brian's tenderness. She only felt her heart beating faster, and instantly, her face and neck turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment and then took a bank card from her pocket. "There's 1.21 million dollars in this card. It's all my savings over the years. I hope it can help you. I... I have something else to do. Bye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without giving Brian a chance to refuse, she put down the bank card and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Anne's back and the bank card she left behind, Brian smiled, and a touch of emotion welled up in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after Anne left, Anastasia, wearing a high-end custom-made white dress, arrived at Brian's villa with Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing them, Brian joked with a smile, "What brings you two beauties here today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Brian's appearance and thinking about Trillion Group's situation, Anastasia felt guilty. If it weren't for her, perhaps Denzel wouldn't have targeted Brian and Trillion Group, leading to Trillion Group being on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia hesitated for a moment, gave up the idea of continuing to hide her identity from Brian, and decided to confess to him. "Brian, I came here today to tell you something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Anastasia with curiosity. "What is it? Seeing my company is about to go bankrupt, you, like those people, are in a hurry to distance yourself from me and are afraid of being implicated, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was speechless, giving up the idea of confessing to Brian. She glared at him and snorted, "You... Brian, is that what you think of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to speak, Eliza stepped forward and said, "Brian, after Ms. Vaughn learned about Trillion Group's situation, she tried every means to transfer all the funds she could access and wanted to help you get through this difficult time. How could you say such harsh words? You're really..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliza!" Anastasia interrupted Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Anastasia took out a bank card and handed it to Brian. "Brian, there's 10 billion dollars in this card. I raised it temporarily. I hope it can help you get through this crisis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Brian had mixed feelings when he looked at the bank card handed by Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought Anastasia came to reveal her identity to him and dissolve their engagement. After all, in everyone's view, the collapse of Trillion Group seemed to be a foregone conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Trillion Group went bankrupt, it meant that Brian had lost his qualification to be the heir of the Godfather and would be left with nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would have no strength to help Anastasia defeat the other heirs of the Vaughn family and help her become the head of the Vaughn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, the best solution for Anastasia was to dissolve the engagement with Brian and find another heir from a top-notch wealthy family. With Anastasia's beauty and competence, it was very easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Brian never expected Anastasia to come and give him money. And it was 10 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Brian feel touched and a bit curious. After all, Anastasia had no idea that he was the Master of the War Deities.</span></p></div>
