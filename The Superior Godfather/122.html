        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Brian possibly resist such provocative teasing and temptation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped his arms around Anne's ample, perky ass and, with his rock-hard cock, charged headlong into that mysterious territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, an unprecedented surge of ecstasy overtook them, prompting both to let out a moan of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt himself tightly enveloped by her endless, warm flesh as slick, arousing juices flowed continuously, making him feel as if he were slowly melting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne felt her empty body filled with the scorching, searing hardness, leaving her with an overwhelming sense of fulfillment and pleasure as she gradually soared to cloud nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their rendezvous shifted directly from the sofa to the balcony, from the balcony to the kitchen, and finally to the bedroom, leaving traces of passion in every spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I feel as if I'm under a spell; whenever I lie in bed, I can't help but think of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you've got me completely hooked&mdash;I just can't break away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne nestled against him, gazing at his handsome face with pure adoration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man gave her both body and soul an unprecedented satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Anne's satisfied expression, a flash of pride and smug satisfaction crossed Brian's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having completely subdued this proud spinster, he felt equally fulfilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at her exquisite beauty, Brian felt a fresh surge of desire ignite as he reached out and pressed Anne's head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his big erection rising again, Anne's cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she parted her seductive lips and lowered her head to take it in, savoring it tenderly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, God..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense stimulation forced Brian to let out an involuntary cry of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, urgent knocking echoed outside, freezing Anne's movements and startling Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, a clear and melodious voice rang out from beyond the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, it's Celeste! Open up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could she want at this hour?" Brian wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian furrowed his brow, his mind filled with questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne shot Brian a glare, clearly unhappy with the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe Brian was involved with Celeste!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... it's not what you think... Celeste and I... oh..." Brian stammered nervously under Anne's intense gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his explanation, he drew in a sharp breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne had taken him in completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation nearly made him cry out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on..." he tried to protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anne had already positioned herself beside him before he could stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved like a rider on horseback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by jealousy and possessiveness, she was determined to claim this man as her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire bed shook violently at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Anne expressed passionate satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, baby... does it feel good?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, baby, you're amazing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, you're so deep inside me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face changed drastically as he quickly covered Anne's mouth with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be trouble if Celeste heard these sounds outside the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he hadn't won over and conquered Celeste yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her proud personality, she would never look at him the same way if she knew about his intimacy with another woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmph..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne was about to speak again, Brian silenced her with his lips to prevent any noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In protest, Anne moved her hips faster and harder, making the bed shake even more violently and creating even louder sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, what the hell is going on in there? Open this door right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the villa's entrance, Celeste frowned at the sounds coming from inside and started kicking the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, if you don't open this door right now, I'm breaking in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face fell when he heard Celeste's threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she was the type of person who would follow through on such a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All desire to continue with Anne vanished as he scooped her up and shoved her into the closet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He warned, "Stay hidden and shut your mouth until I say otherwise. If anyone finds you, you're on your own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Brian quickly straightened up the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed to the bathroom, jumped under the shower, and washed away all lipstick traces from his face and body. With just a towel wrapped around his waist, he opened the front door downstairs.</span></p></div>
