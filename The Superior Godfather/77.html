        <h1>Chapter 77 How About You Enlighten Me?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Beach Hotel, located on the picturesque Riverwood waterfront, boasted stunning coastal views and a serene atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brian arrived at the hotel restaurant, he found that Sam and the others hadn't yet shown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A server led him to a cozy corner table by the window, a spot that Sam had specifically reserved for him, complete with his favorite dish orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, would you like us to serve your meal now?" the server inquired politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, let's get started!" Brian replied, nodding with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having slept in and skipped breakfast, he felt a rumble in his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he wasn't one to enjoy waiting around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a delightful array of dishes arrived at his table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian savored the delicious food while basking in the warm sunlight, he couldn't help but admire the beautiful seaside view, feeling completely at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ryan strode in, dressed sharply in a black suit, exuding confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he spotted Brian feasting at the table Sam had reserved, his expression darkened, rage flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you damn bastard! What the hell are you doing here?" Ryan snapped, his voice low and furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow, a playful smirk forming on his face. "This restaurant isn't yours, so why can't I be here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face turned stormy as he fixed his glare on Brian, practically seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "This is Sam's reserved spot for the Master of the War Deities. If the Master shows up and sees this, it could spell disaster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling demeanor, he hissed, "Brian, I don't have time for your games. Get the hell out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian casually lifted his glass of red wine, savoring a sip. "And what if I refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's fury boiled over at Brian's blatant disregard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think just because you're the chairman of Trillion Group you can do whatever you want. I swear, if you don't get out of here right now, you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian wasn't surprised that Ryan knew about his position at Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He met Ryan's glare with calm indifference. "Well, I'm curious to see how you plan to make me regret anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was so furious he could barely contain himself. "You idiot! Do you even know who's supposed to sit at this table?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who?" Brian asked, feigning innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan clenched his fists, his voice dripping with disdain. "You know the War Deities? This spot is reserved for the Master of the War Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian elegantly cut a piece of steak and popped it into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Well, it seems I'm in the right place then, because I am the Master of the War Deities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan erupted into laughter, as if he had heard the greatest joke ever. "You? The Master of the War Deities? Ha! Brian, have you lost your mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know who the Master of the War Deities is? He's at the pinnacle of global power! The War Deities he founded is renowned worldwide, and considered the top of the top, making countless forces tremble in fear. Even many small to medium-sized countries fall under his sway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Claiming to be the Master of the War Deities? That's just plain ignorant and utterly ridiculous..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian regarded Ryan with calm, almost amused eyes, as if he were looking at a clown putting on a show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not me who's ignorant, Ryan. It's you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you're about to hit rock bottom, and you're still here acting tough like a fool... I'll give you one last chance: are you leaving or not?" Ryan demanded, his voice low and menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the death glare Ryan shot his way, Brian replied coolly, "The one who should leave is you, not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, you're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold his rage any longer, Ryan snatched the wine bottle from the table and hurled it at Brian with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the bottle whistled through the air, Brian tensed, ready to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a flash, a fork sliced through the air, striking Ryan's wrist with surgical precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, like a phantom, a stunning figure appeared between them. Zoe, having come with Sam, had arrived just in time. She seized the wine bottle from Ryan's hands, and with a resounding crash, shattered it against his head, leaving him reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bottle shattered, red wine and blood mingling, staining Ryan's clothes in a gruesome display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wha&mdash;" he gasped, struggling to comprehend the chaos as blood trickled down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could recover, a swift kick from Zoe sent him sprawling across the floor, dozens of feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fury in her eyes, Zoe stood ready for another attack, her anger palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had rushed upstairs while Sam parked, only to witness someone daring enough to lay hands on Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at the bloodied Ryan, prepared to finish what she'd started, but Brian quickly stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, step back!" he commanded, firm yet composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe hesitated for a moment, her icy demeanor softening as she obeyed, retreating behind Brian with an air of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now on the ground, Ryan was a pitiful sight, covered in blood and struggling to get back on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, fixed on Zoe, burned with rage as he said, "You bitch! Do you have any idea who I am? How dare you lay a finger on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's gaze was sharp and challenging as she observed him with a mix of amusement and disdain. "Oh? How about you enlighten me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming with anger, Ryan raged, "Listen up, you worthless piece of trash. I'm Ryan Carter, and I'm about to gain the appreciation of the Master of the War Deities. I'm joining the War Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cousin is Sam Carter, known as the Unparalleled Blade, one of the Twelve Blades of the War Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to end up six feet under next to this bastard Brian, you better kill him right now and apologize to me!"</span></p></div>
