        <h1>Chapter 145 Crisis Resolved</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the conference room of the Quadrillion Group headquarters, Denzel, Thomas, Zac, Eric, and others were sitting in front of the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, leisurely sipping coffee. They were keeping an eye on the situation of the Trillion Group, waiting to laugh at their misfortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when they saw Ted, Galen, and others come out of the Trillion Group and lead the striking employees outside to leave, they showed a surprised expression, and their hearts were filled with doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Galen just led the employees away like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only Galen, but also those who surrounded the Trillion Group are gradually dispersing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, what is going on? What did Brian do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' face looked cold. He directly took out his phone and called Ted, Galen, and the others over to ask about the situation in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Weber, Mr. Hastings, what's the matter with you? Why did you suddenly lead the people away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted, Galen, and the others all had helpless expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Denzel, Thomas, and others fanning the flames behind the scenes, they wouldn't have done these. Ted, Galen, and the others suffered a huge backlash and had heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment, Ted and Galen could only tell Denzel the situation truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Brian settled all your debts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to their account, Thomas and Zac were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Denzel had an expression of surprise on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! When we left, there was no money in the Trillion Group's account, and no major banks provided them with funds... How did Brian get the money to pay you?" Thomas' words voiced all the questions in everyone's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Denzel frowned and fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel could understand that Zoe and Raven from Shadow Fang brought people to support Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were a gang and would do things as long as they were paid. But Denzel didn't know where Brian got the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when everyone was puzzled, they suddenly received the news that Celeste, on behalf of the Trillion Group, was holding a press conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the press conference, Celeste not only publicly refuted the rumor that the Trillion Group's capital chain was broken and it was about to go bankrupt, but also announced a piece of news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Trillion Group had newly established a subsidiary company to develop the health and beauty industry and was about to launch a series of beauty and healthcare products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This series of products was called the EnerGlow Series, which consisted of three products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she comprehensively promoted and publicized the EnerGlow Series at the press conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This news shocked everyone and made people even more convinced that the rumor that the Trillion Group's capital chain was broken and it was about to go bankrupt was false.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the Trillion Group wouldn't have the funds and energy to develop beauty and healthcare products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were full of anticipation for this series of products launched by the Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, Eric, Zac, and others were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth are Brian and Celeste up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did they establish a subsidiary to develop products? Why didn't we know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most importantly, where did they get all the money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was even more confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's face became increasingly gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The development of the situation had exceeded his plan and expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor, who was beside Denzel, glanced at the news on his phone and said, "Sir, just now there was news that Ms. Vaughn had withdrawn the working capital from all her companies. Brian's funds should be provided by Ms. Vaughn behind the scenes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted, Galen, and the others were all surprised to know that Brian was actually related to Denzel's cousin, Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, like Denzel, was one of the five heirs of the Vaughn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel suddenly laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "I forgot about my cousin. But I didn't expect that she would disregard her own business just to help Brian... So stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, we got an excellent opportunity to suppress her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp light flashed in Denzel's eyes, and he said in a deep voice, "Victor, use all available resources and do whatever it takes to suppress and snipe at the stock price of the Anastasia Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want the stock price of the Anastasia Group to plummet, making all her efforts over the years go to waste, and finally make her submit and beg for mercy in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Denzel could make Anastasia submit to him this time, he would be one step closer to the head of the Vaughn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Victor replied respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subsequently, Denzel looked at Ted, Galen, and the others and comforted them with a smile, "Gentlemen, there's no need to worry about the Trillion Group. Even if you've lost your cooperation with the Trillion Group, you still have a partnership with the Quadrillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you will be the Quadrillion Group's closest partners. Are you willing to create a future with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Vaughn. We are willing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted, Galen, and the others, who had been full of depression, were now excited and overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Quadrillion Group had potential and would surely replace and even surpass the Trillion Group in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being able to cooperate with the Quadrillion Group, they were bound to return to their peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the series of beauty products launched by Celeste at the press conference, they didn't take it seriously at all or believe that these three products would achieve great success.</span></p></div>
