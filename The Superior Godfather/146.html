        <h1>Chapter 146 Aria's Counterattack</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the conference room of the Queen's Construction Group, Tanner was overjoyed when he learned that Aria had embezzled two billion dollars from the company to help Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that this was an opportunity to bring down Aria, and the chance of his taking power was approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, he not only summoned all the company's shareholders and told them about this matter, but also called the police, intending to investigate Aria's embezzlement of the group's money, hold her legally accountable, and ruin her reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all the shareholders and senior executives of the Queen's Construction Group were gathered in the conference room, waiting for Aria to come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Aria was unaware of this and was immersed in the joy of cooperating with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she and her secretary returned to the company, she was called to the conference room by Tanner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the major shareholders sitting in the conference room, Aria was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria asked, "What's the urgent matter that you called me here for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man with a bushy beard slapped the conference table hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aria, how dare you ask that. You should be well aware of what you've done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He named Noah Morgan, was the largest shareholder of the company, and also a supporter of Tanner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Noah had initially been supportive of Aria. But in order to get Noah's support, Tanner had gone so far as to personally send his own wife to Noah's bed for Noah to toy with, making Noah sink into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, lured by Tanner's wife, Noah chose to support Tanner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Noah's lead, the other shareholders also glared at Aria with disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was puzzled as to why they were so angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I really don't know what I've done wrong, nor do I understand what you're talking about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner sneered, looked at Aria with mockery, and said, "Aria, stop that. Did you privately transfer two billion dollars from the group's funds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria finally understood the reason why the shareholders were angry and quickly explained, "I did use two billion dollars from the group's funds, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her words were interrupted by Tanner before she could finish, "You don't need to explain. Everyone, you've all heard it, right? Aria's embezzlement of our group's funds is a fact. How should this situation be dealt with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders' faces were gloomy as they glared at Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They said in unison, "She should be removed from the position of president, dismissed, and held legally accountable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner smiled, feeling confident, and looked at Aria with great interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aria, considering your years of dedication to our group, if you hand over your equity, resign from the position of president, and recover the two billion dollars, I will plead with the board of directors on your behalf and no longer pursue your legal liability. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria realized that Tanner was manipulating this matter behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "What if I don't agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner clapped his hands, and several police officers walked in with handcuffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Then I can only have them take you to the police station for investigation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Tanner's opinion, Aria's embezzlement of two billion dollars from the group was enough to send her to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his heart was filled with joy and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked at Tanner coldly and said, "Tanner, do you really have to be so ruthless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner smiled, pretending to be helpless, and said, "I don't want to do this, but you made a mistake. When you made up your mind to embezzle two billion dollars from the company to support Brian, you should have known what the consequences would be, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Aria could speak, Tanner continued. "The shareholders here have trusted you a great deal. If you're willing to sincerely apologize to everyone, perhaps, out of friendship, they'll show you some leniency."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria suddenly laughed and looked at Tanner with a teasing gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Tanner, you don't really think you've won against me, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's eyes flickered, and he asked, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ending might disappoint you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria gave him a disdainful look and gracefully threw a bank card and a document onto the conference table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "The two billion dollars I take from the company is in this bank card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This document is a long-term cooperation agreement I signed with the Trillion Group. From now on, all engineering projects of the Trillion Group will be undertaken by the Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, the Trillion Group has also transferred five billion dollars to our group for the next development of Weston's project..."</span></p></div>
