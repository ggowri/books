        <h1>Chapter 80 Kill Brian</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Anastasia arrived at the private room upstairs, accompanied by Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she settled into her seat across from Denzel, she maintained a calm demeanor. "Denzel, I'm curious why you traveled all this way to see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel slowly removed his sunglasses, revealing a handsome, sharp-featured face, his gaze fixed on Anastasia with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you came to Riverwood to break off your engagement with that useless Edwards family guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was taken aback momentarily before she nodded. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel took a leisurely sip of his red wine, a playful smile on his face. "So, have you gone through with the breakup?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have, I can introduce you to a guy with real potential. I guarantee you'll like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia replied with a cool tone, "Thanks for the offer, but I haven't called off my engagement with Brian yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel squinted, a hint of disbelief in his voice. "You haven't? Then why are you still holding onto that worthless engagement?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't possibly have feelings for that loser, can you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's response was terse. "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for more from her, Denzel pressed on. "If that's the case, why not just end it? I saw that loser down below flirting with some woman, all lovey-dovey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not going to handle it, I will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't stand to see you wasting your time on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Denzel stood to leave, Anastasia stopped him with a firm hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was sharp, a chill in her demeanor. "I appreciate your concern, but this is my personal matter. I'll handle it myself, so no need to worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel looked taken aback, surprised by her strong reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes locked, and a palpable tension filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Denzel broke the silence, feigning a sigh of resignation. "Hey, I'm just looking out for you as your older cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to react like that! Fine, I won't meddle anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's icy demeanor softened slightly as she considered his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, aside from looking out for my personal life, is there anything else bringing you to Riverwood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel shrugged, a nonchalant expression on his face. "Not really. I just heard Riverwood's development is promising, so I thought I'd come check it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, it's been a while since we've seen each other, right? Let's put business aside for now and enjoy a couple of drinks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Denzel raised his glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded slightly, lifting her own glass to clink against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her drink, Anastasia stood up and said, "Denzel, I have some things to take care of, so I won't be staying for dinner. Enjoy your meal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned to leave the room, Eliza following closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their relationship had never been particularly warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, even if you have things to do, you should at least eat! Don't starve yourself; I'd hate to see you get too thin," Denzel called after her, his voice laced with feigned concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for your concern; I'll be careful," she replied without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked away, Denzel's smile faded, replaced by an icy demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Victor Collins, who stood respectfully behind him. "Victor, what's your take on my cousin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor, the older man, spoke in a low, steady tone, "Mr. Denzel Vaughn, I believe Anastasia has quite the ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I understand, that influential figure has decided to accept Brian again. If Brian can double the market value of Trillion Group within a year and survive, he'll reclaim his position as heir and compete for the Godfather title against the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia's reluctance to break off the engagement stems from her desire to leverage Brian's identity and power to vie for control of the Vaughn family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel took a measured sip of his red wine, nodding thoughtfully. "Your analysis makes sense. What do you think I should do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Denzel Vaughn, all you need to do is prevent Brian from passing that influential figure's test. That will crush Anastasia's hopes, and she'll willingly submit to you, ready to be manipulated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel asked, "Can you be more specific?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Word has it that Thomas, the second-largest shareholder of Trillion Group, has had a falling out with Brian. We could sway him to help us undermine Trillion Group from within. Without that, Brian won't stand a chance at passing the test and regaining his inheritance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel frowned slightly, considering the plan. "That's still not enough. I want you to hit the Dark Web and find some reliable hitmen. Get rid of Brian for good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor hesitated for a moment. "Aren't you worried that influential figure will hold you accountable for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel smirked, swirling his wine elegantly in the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are plenty of people who want him dead. Who's to say it was me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's eyes lit up with understanding, and he clasped his hands respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see what you mean. I'll take care of it right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and left the room, ready to execute Denzel's orders.</span></p></div>
