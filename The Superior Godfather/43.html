Kevin roared at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mysterious new chairman has never even shown up at the company, so how could he possibly reject our decisions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Celeste was genuinely acting on the new chairman's orders, Kevin knew he was utterly screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear the consequences of such a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, I handle all company matters and communications with the chairman, so he does not need to come in person. Second, he wanted to use this to evaluate all of you. Unfortunately, your performance has left him deeply disappointed," Celeste explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused briefly before continuing, "Especially you, Kevin. You've abused your position, sexually harassed female subordinates, and taken bribes. The chairman is utterly disgusted with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's face twisted in rage as he pointed at Celeste and bellowed, "You... you're spewing nothing but lies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste fixed him with an icy stare, her face completely expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll see soon enough if I'm making this up. By my count, the police and prosecutors should be arriving any minute now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she finished speaking, piercing police sirens echoed outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large contingent of police officers and prosecutors rushed in, heading straight for Kevin and Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin Wright, Ethan Carter... you're wanted for rape, murder, and taking bribes. Come with us quietly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin and Ethan's faces went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin swallowed hard, trying to keep his cool as he asked in a shaky voice, "What... what proof do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Proof?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead prosecutor's eyes glinted as he pulled out a file.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about the 150 million dollars Ethan wired to your private account to push the Carter Group deal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or the innocent girls you two secretly abused and killed? Are you going to deny it now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kevin stared at the file's contents, all color drained from his face, and he collapsed into his chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan broke into a cold sweat. Before he could escape, a police officer tackled him to the ground and slapped him in handcuffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take them away!" commanded the prosecutor in an icy tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men were forcibly dragged off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to see the chairman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Ms. Hawthorne! Please forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin and Ethan screamed in terror, struggling uselessly against their restraints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face turned ashen as if struck by lightning, watching Kevin and Ethan being hauled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia stood there, pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had expected things to take such a dramatic turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian becoming Trillion Group's partner was one thing, but getting Kevin and Ethan arrested was something else entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thorough investigation would have unthinkable consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, Mark, and their supporters stood there dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew the Carter Group was finished with Kevin and Ethan's arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had they gained nothing, but they'd also managed to make an enemy of Brian, Trillion Group's new partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Brian retaliated against them later, the consequences would be devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces turned pale as they were overwhelmed with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gazed calmly at the pale-faced Sophia and Ryan, his expression neutral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Sophia, how do you like the results? Satisfied?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia glared at Brian, her face twisted in anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You were behind all this, weren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gave a slight smile, his voice light and casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're giving me too much credit. I'm just a nobody. How could I possibly take down Kevin and Ethan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian's victorious demeanor made Sophia's face whiter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan couldn't contain his rage any longer. He lunged forward with his fist aimed at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You son of a bitch! I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint flashed in Brian's eyes as he lashed out with a powerful kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening thud, Ryan spat blood and flew off the platform like a rag doll, landing motionless several yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia cried out in horror as she rushed to help Ryan up from the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan clutched his chest, glaring at Brian, but before he could speak, Brian cut him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Security! Throw these shameless cheaters out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Security guards rushed over at his command and dragged Sophia and Ryan out like stray dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had once been on top of the world, but now they'd become despised outcasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they were being dragged away, Ryan and Sophia screamed in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll pay for this with your life, Brian!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You low-class piece of trash! Do you think this will make me regret anything? Let me tell you! I'll never regret a damn thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes glinted with cold fury as their figures disappeared from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No regrets, huh? Just wait! The day will come when you regret everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because this is only the beginning of my revenge!"</span></p></div>
