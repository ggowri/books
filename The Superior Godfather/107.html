        <h1>Chapter 107 I Want You to Be My Woman</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Zoe prepared breakfast for Brian and then left the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian woke up and smiled at the note left by Zoe on the table and the breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, when Brian was about to go out, Celeste came to his villa with documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was wearing a big, long, red V-neck dress, showing her sexy, and tall perfect figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The V-neck of the red dress was very deep, which could not cover her cleavage and her beautiful breasts that were about to burst out. With her noble and intellectual temperament, she was really dazzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian asked jokingly, "Celeste, how come you have time to come here today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste rolled her eyes at Brian and said unhappily, "As the chairman of the company, you haven't been to the company for several days. How dare you ask me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the last shareholders' meeting, her attitude towards Brian had obviously changed a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had also become more intimate and harmonious, like friends for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled awkwardly, "Ahem. Because I believe you can handle everything in the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste glared at Brian. She walked to the sofa and sat down. Her two slender legs overlapped, looking very charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are lazy, just say it. Don't make up this excuse to fool me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be said that among all the women Brian knew, Celeste was the tallest and had the longest legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but look at her legs a few more times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really wanted to know how tempting these legs would be in black stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Brian's gaze, Celeste sneered and teased, "Do they look good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian admired her smooth and slender legs and nodded. "Yes. They look better in stockings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste didn't expect Brian to be so indecent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suppressed her anger and smiled seductively. She reached out her hand and patted her thigh, looking at Brian with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to feel them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feel them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian swallowed hard and stared at Celeste. "How?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she inviting him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled and slid her hand down her thigh. "For example, do you want to touch them or put on stockings of various colors for them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Brian was excited and felt dry in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to keep himself calm and asked in a deep voice, "Tell me. What are your conditions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had a charming smile on her face and said teasingly, "Actually, my conditions are very simple. As long as you complete the test of the Godfather within a year, I will let you feel them. What do you say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can touch them however you want, and put on whatever color stockings you want. How about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celeste's opinion, Brian was too lazy and had no ambition at all. He was just wasting time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he continued in this state, it would take him a long time to complete the task assigned by the Godfather and pass the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought about it and decided to use this method to motivate and stimulate Brian so that his work attitude could be more positive and motivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, her fate was tied to Brian's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Brian couldn't complete the test of the Godfather and regain the qualification of the heir, then her end would be extremely miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Brian was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obviously didn't expect Celeste to motivate him in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had always wanted to feel Celeste's beautiful legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very excited inside, but on the surface, he seemed very calm. He pretended to be dissatisfied and said, "Tsk. I can only touch and let you wear stockings? This is too boring. Do you think I'm a kid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste didn't expect Brian to react like this. She was really furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suppressed her anger and said with an unhappy face, "What else do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stretched out his palm to hold Celeste's chin, staring at her delicate cheeks with burning eyes, and said domineeringly, "I want you to be my woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was slightly startled. "Be your woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded. "As long as I complete the test of the Godfather within a year and regain the qualification of the heir, you will agree to be my woman. How about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was appearance, figure, temperament, style, or means of doing things, Celeste was in line with Brian's taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He naturally would not let go of such a beauty easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Celeste hesitated and fell into a long silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, to motivate Brian, she decided to go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. As long as you can complete the test of the Godfather within one year and regain the qualification of the heir, I will agree to be your woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. Let's high-five. It's a deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian showed a satisfied smile and stretched out his palm to Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste hesitated for a moment, stretched out her hand, and high-fived him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had very high requirements for men. But if Brian passed the test and regained the qualification of heir, then he was indeed qualified to be her man.</span></p></div>
