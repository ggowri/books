        <h1>Chapter 13 Anastasia's Temptation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan ordered this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing those words, Brian's expression immediately darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like the lesson I gave Ryan earlier wasn't nearly enough," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous glint flashed in Zoe's eyes as she said sharply, "Master, let me go take care of him right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian quickly stopped her, raising his hand. "That would be too easy for him. I want to keep him alive, let him suffer, make him regret everything, and die slowly in despair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian handed Zoe a business card. "This is my number. Take your people and go. I'll reach out to you when I need you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe clung to his arm with a reluctant expression, almost pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It took me so long to find you. Are you really going to send me away now? Let me stay and keep you company, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she clung to him, Brian felt a soft, almost intoxicating pressure on his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, he looked down and saw Zoe's ample chest pressing against his arm, deforming with each movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curves were so full it felt as though her body was going to wrap around his entire arm. The sensation made his breathing quicken, a strong, almost primal urge rising in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This woman... she really is a tempting siren," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was so provocative that the onlookers couldn't help but cast envious glances toward Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's gaze turned icy. A layer of frost seemed to form over her perfectly sculpted face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian cleared his throat, reluctantly pulling his arm out from between Zoe's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm entertaining some guests. You should head back for now. I'll contact you when I need you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll be waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe gave him a playful kiss blown from her fingertips, leaving behind a tantalizing comment. Then, with Shadow Fang members in tow, she left with a confident stride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven and Tyrone, relieved that no one was holding them accountable, scrambled after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd of onlookers began to disperse slowly, their murmurs fading into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian returned to the table with an apologetic look in his eyes as he turned to Anastasia. "Sorry about that, Ms. Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia took a graceful sip of her cocktail, her eyes gleaming with subtle meaning. "Mr. Edwards, I never expected even Ms. Guzman to show such respect toward you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, your identity is clearly much deeper than I realized. Could you explain what she meant by 'Master'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled, his tone casual, "It's just a title, Ms. Vaughn. You don't need to pay it any mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the past. The rise of "the War Deities," the empire he built that had become too powerful for its own good, clashing with too many interests. Eventually, world organizations united to hunt them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he had grown weary of the violence and killing, longing for a quiet life with Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he disbanded "the War Deities" and chose to fade into obscurity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His past was something he preferred to avoid talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Brian didn't want to elaborate, Anastasia pressed further. "Mr. Edwards, you seem to have quite a close relationship with Ms. Guzman. Is she your girlfriend or, perhaps, a lover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought for a moment before responding, "Ms. Vaughn, you've misunderstood. I just got divorced, and I'm still single. Zoe and I have always had a professional relationship. She's just always been... a bit enthusiastic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Professional relationship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Anastasia had already guessed their connection from Zoe's attitude toward Brian, hearing him confirm it in his own words still left her somewhat surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Zoe was the leader of the biggest underground organization in Riverwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, you're single, then? I just happen to be single as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia leaned in slightly, a smile playing on her lips as she asked, "I wonder, Mr. Edwards, do you prefer women like Ms. Guzman or someone like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she bent slightly forward, and the neckline of her dress shifted, revealing a deep, enticing cleavage, enough space between her breasts to fit three fingers, and the black lace of her lingerie that barely contained her ample figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfect body and stunningly cold, beautiful face made for a tempting combination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt a sudden, intense urge to pin this cold, aristocratic beauty beneath him, to conquer her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, you still haven't answered me," Anastasia teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian frozen in place, she smiled again, her voice dripping with playful seduction. She then slid one of her black-stockinged legs slowly up his thigh.</span></p></div>
