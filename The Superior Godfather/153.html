        <h1>Chapter 153 Lurking in the Shadows</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside a towering skyscraper nestled in the heart of Viremoor, the capital city of Azuriath State, a brown-haired young man lounged in his office, blindfolded and playing a game of hide-and-seek with a group of scantily clad starlets dressed in barely-there lingerie. The scene was extravagant, indulgent, and just a little bit scandalous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, a middle-aged butler burst into the room in a rush. Before he could even speak, the young man grabbed him and started groping around with both hands. "Come here, baby," he chuckled. "Let Daddy have a feel and see who you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler cleared his throat awkwardly and quickly spoke up, "It's me, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second the young man heard that, he recoiled in disgust and let go, gagging. "Ugh, what the hell are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bring good news," the butler replied, unfazed. With that, he respectfully handed the young man a tablet. On the screen was a headline breaking the scandal of Denzel getting caught having sex with his secretary and collapsing mid-act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man's eyes widened as he read through the explosive news, his face lighting up with a mix of shock and glee. "Wait, is this real? Denzel actually passed out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler politely replied, "It seems so, sir. Although Mr. Denzel Vaughn didn't die, he did faint from the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's pulling the strings behind the scenes. Not only have they exposed a ton of dirt linking him and Glory Group, but they've also launched a financial assault on his company. The stock price has been plummeting nonstop, and the company's market value has already shrunk by over 80 billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, the young man burst into laughter. "Is that so? Looks like Lady Luck's on my side today. Seems like out of the five successors, he might be the first one to go down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler hesitated for a moment before adding, "There's something else you should be aware of&mdash;your cousin Anastasia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia? What about her?" The young man's eyes flickered with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, he never really took Anastasia seriously. Out of the five successors of the Vaughn family, she was by far the weakest link.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the butler said, "Ms. Vaughn may not be as simple as you think. There's likely a powerful investor from overseas backing her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That stopped the young man in his tracks. "She's got someone powerful behind her? What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler explained, "Earlier today, the Anastasia Group was hit with a sudden and aggressive short attack from unknown investors, causing a sharp drop in stock prices. But right at the critical moment, a massive influx of overseas capital poured in, stabilizing the price. Not long after, all that dirt on Mr. Denzel Vaughn and Glory Group surfaced online, and his company's stock immediately went into free fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect all of this was orchestrated by that mysterious backer supporting Ms. Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the full report, the young man narrowed his eyes and a knowing smile crept across his face. "Well, well... didn't think my little cousin had it in her. Things are starting to get real interesting. Looks like I'll need to move up some of my plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Viremoor International Shooting Range, a young man with a cold, imposing demeanor stood holding a Desert Eagle, ready to fire at a target 600 feet away. He radiated a sharp, militaristic aura, every inch of him disciplined and dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden lift of the gun, he opened fire. Bullet after bullet tore through the air, landing dead-center on the target without the slightest deviation. His body remained completely still, stiff as a rifle, unfazed by the Desert Eagle's powerful recoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smooth, effortless display stunned the wealthy onlookers around him. Their faces were filled with admiration, their gazes openly worshipful. What truly blew their minds was that he hadn't even aimed&mdash;every shot had been instinctive, casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some bold socialites found their hearts skipping a beat. A few even stepped forward, eager to take photos with him or ask for his number. Surprisingly, the cold-faced man responded with gentlemanly grace and didn't turn any of them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a butler hurried over. Seeing this, the man gave the group an apologetic nod and left swiftly with the butler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on, Merton?" he asked curtly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, your cousin Denzel... there's been an incident," the butler replied before recounting the whole story involving Denzel and Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, the man's lips curved into a faint smile. "Heh. Things just keep getting more interesting. Who would've thought Anastasia had been hiding this much? I'd love to see how Denzel plans to dig himself out of this mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, in a top-tier private club, a stunning woman was just about to start her spa session when she, too, received the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stared at the overwhelming flood of headlines online, her red lips curved into a teasing smile, lighting up her sultry, seductive features. "Well, well... who knew Denzel and Anastasia would start fighting so soon? But I'll admit, I didn't expect things to unfold quite like this. I wonder how the family's going to react once they catch wind of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her voice trailed off, she slowly undid her robe. As it slipped down, her breathtaking figure, one that had driven countless men wild, was revealed in full. The moment left every female staff member in the room gaping in stunned silence, their eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even they had to admit, this woman's body was on another level. They had served all kinds of rich socialites before, but this was the first time any of them had seen a body this jaw-droppingly hot.</span></p></div>
