        <h1>Chapter 134 Determined to Help Brian</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Trillion Group is going to go bankrupt?" As soon as Tanner finished speaking, the others in the conference were shocked. They looked at Tanner in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's expression changed, and she stared at Tanner sharply. "Why do you say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's well-known on the internet now. Just read the news online, and you'll know," Tanner sneered coldly. "Aria, Brian deceived us. He's not the owner of Transcendent Construction Group but the new president of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason he cooperated with you was just to reduce the costs for Trillion Group. You were deceived, and you didn't even realize it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the others were shocked again. They all took out their mobile phones and checked the information to verify the truth of Tanner's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they saw the overwhelming amount of news on the internet. They were stunned, saying, "Thomas, the second largest shareholder of Trillion Group, led the shareholders and senior executives to withdraw their investments and switch to another company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The new president of Trillion Group, Brian, is just a commoner from the lowest level of society?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins, it seems that we were deceived by Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their words and reading the news online, Aria frowned. Her face was alternating between pale and livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a good impression of Brian and had been very appreciative of him. But she never expected that he would deceive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Aria's livid face, Tanner smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Aria had obtained the project of Weston of Trillion Group from Brian's Transcendent Construction Group. She had been so glorious and completely taken control of the right to speak in this company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Tanner's situation extremely pressured. Today, he finally turned the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner mocked Aria, "Ms. Jenkins, I had brought so many projects to the company, but you had refused to cooperate with these partners and wasted so many cooperation opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you could lead the company to soar after getting the development project in Weston from Trillion Group through Brian's Transcendent Construction Group. But in the end, it was just a farce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian had ulterior motives when he gave you the project. Not only did he want to take advantage of this opportunity to reduce costs and make our company work for him free, but he also wanted to win your favor and get you on his side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked solemn. She said coldly, "As far as I know, Brian is not that kind of person. He must have his reasons for doing this. He..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before she could finish her words, Tanner interrupted her,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care what his reasons are. Now, apart from the initial payment they made, our company has advanced nearly one billion dollars for that project. Ms. Jenkins, go to see Brian and ask him to settle the project payment for this period."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Aria frowned, "But the project isn't completed yet. How can I ask him for the payment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's your business," Tanner sneered. "Are you still planning to continue advancing funds for the construction of this project?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the scenes of getting along with Brian, Aria took a deep breath and said, "To be honest, I do have that plan. I believe Brian isn't that kind of person, and I'm sure that he can get through this difficult time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our only chance. As long as we complete the development project in Weston, Queen's Construction Group will completely build up its reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Tanner couldn't help laughing out loud. "Aria, you're being too naive! If you want to continue advancing funds for the construction, you'd better ask the senior executives here if they agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many senior executives led by Tanner immediately expressed their attitudes one after another. "Ms. Jenkins, we don't agree to continue advancing funds for the construction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins, Trillion Group is about to go bankrupt. There's no need to continue with this project. As far as I know, all the construction companies that cooperated with Trillion Group have gone on strike collectively."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This project is simply a deal at a loss. If we continue, we'll only lose more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the senior executives who had remained neutral opposed Aria's proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a result frustrated Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her, Tanner smiled smugly. He knew very well that his chance to bring down Aria had come, and he immediately said, "Ms. Jenkins, if you want to continue the construction, go find Brian and ask him to settle the project payment for the first period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you can't get that money back and cause a huge loss to the company, I'll truthfully report to the board of directors and remove you from the position of president, and let someone more capable take over. Let's call it a day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Aria's response, Tanner swaggered out of the conference room with the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at their backs, Aria was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary beside her hesitated for a moment and asked in a low voice, "Ms. Jenkins, what are your plans next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria came to her senses and turned to look at the secretary, asking, "How much liquidity is there in the company's account now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary answered, "There are about two billion dollars that can be accessed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria said, "Prepare the money and come with me to see Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the secretary was shocked. She looked at Aria in disbelief. "Ms. Jenkins, are you planning to use the money to help Brian?"</span></p></div>
