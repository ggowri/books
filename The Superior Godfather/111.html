        <h1>Chapter 111 Arrogant Rich Guy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne. You bought too many things, and it's inconvenient to carry them. Our company provides door-to-door delivery service. Please leave an address. We will deliver it to your door later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the manager's words, Brian and Celeste nodded, left their addresses, and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were stopped by Eleanor before they took a few steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Brian arrogantly, pointed at his nose, and asked, "Brian, tell the truth. Where did you get all this money? Did you secretly transfer Sophia's property?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Eleanor's opinion, Brian was a poor bastard at the bottom of society, and it was impossible for him to have so much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes flashed, and he looked at Eleanor with impatience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I tell you where my money came from? Who are you to me? What does this have to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor was speechless. She was about to speak when she was interrupted by Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A good dog doesn't block the road. Please get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor was shaking with anger, staring at Brian with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You called me a dog?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said nonchalantly, "I didn't say that. You admitted it yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor had never been treated like this before. She raised her hand and wanted to slap Brian in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes flashed coldly. She stood in front of Brian and grabbed her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor looked ugly and cursed. "You bitch, let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face darkened, and she slapped Eleanor in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been unhappy with Eleanor for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor screamed and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She covered her face and looked at Celeste with undisguised anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You bitch. You hit me? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she suddenly stretched out her hands with sharp nails and pounced on Celeste like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor wanted to tear Celeste's face and completely disfigure her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she was kicked away before she rushed to Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long legs were an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Celeste's movements were so cool, which made Brian's eyes light up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Celeste to be a martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor fell to the ground and covered her stomach in pain. She stared at Brian and Celeste with cold eyes. Her eyes were filled with undisguised anger and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastards! How dare you do this to me? Do you know who my boyfriend is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Brian smiled. Celeste asked with interest, "Oh? Tell me. Who is your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should have heard of the Paul Group, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's eyes flashed with pride, and she stared at Brian and Celeste with a cold face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My boyfriend is Patrick Smith from the Paul Group. If you know what's good for you, kneel and apologize to me immediately. Maybe I will be kind enough to spare your lives! Otherwise, when my boyfriend comes, he will throw you into the river to feed the fish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the faces of the people watching around changed. They subconsciously shrank their necks, and a trace of fear flashed in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paul Group was one of the top ten well-known groups in Riverwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick was notoriously arrogant and domineering. And he was very good at fighting. He was not someone that ordinary people could afford to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brian's and Celeste's expressions did not change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention Patrick, even Paul, the boss of the Paul Group, was nothing to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the two of them didn't say anything, Eleanor thought they were scared and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you scared? If you are scared, get on your knees immediately... Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Eleanor finished her words, Celeste slapped her in the face again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor covered her face and looked at Celeste in disbelief. "You bitch. How dare you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if your boyfriend came, I would still hit you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes flashed coldly, and when she was about to slap her again, a cold voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Do you have the guts to touch my woman again?"</span></p></div>
