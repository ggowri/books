        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, as the sunlight streamed through the window, Brian slowly opened his sleepy eyes. He touched something soft and elastic, which startled him. Reflexively, he squeezed it twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe let out a soft hum as she slowly woke from her dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfectly sculpted, seductive body lay bare before Brian, setting his nerves on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of their wild night together rushed back into Brian's mind, igniting the flames of desire within him once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the longing in Brian's eyes, Zoe flashed a captivating smile, one that made her even more irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She extended her long, sensuous tongue and kissed Brian's neck, her slender hand gently caressing his broad chest, gradually moving down to grasp the now-erecting member, stroking it gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling its heat intensify, Zoe's eyes became hazy with desire. She slowly lowered her head, taking it into her mouth, her long tongue teasing and tantalizing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electric sensation sent waves of pleasure through Brian's body, his breathing growing heavy as a look of bliss and enjoyment spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Zoe's smile widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that serving Brian in this way was the greatest honor of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Brian was happy, so was she.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, you're amazing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gazed down at the beautiful woman kneeling before him, her head lowered in concentration. He reached out to fondle her full, soft breasts, kneading them roughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his touch, Zoe let out a soft, muffled moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she pressed her breasts tightly around his member, moving her body sensually as she locked eyes with him, her gaze like molten silk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, is this pleasure enough for you?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian swallowed hard, his mouth dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to speak when Zoe suddenly shifted positions. In the heat of his gaze, she stretched her long legs, clad in black stockings, and used her delicate feet to grip him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... my..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unique sensation made Brian gasp, his mind flashing back to last night when Anastasia had used her feet to tease him at the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the pleasure on Brian's face, Zoe smiled alluringly. Then, with a seemingly impossible angle, she bent forward, taking him into her mouth once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands and feet worked in tandem, teasing him with her toes while her tongue worked in gentle strokes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt as though he were soaring through the clouds, every ounce of control slipping away as he released into Zoe's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Zoe's gentle, caring touch, Brian found an unprecedented level of satisfaction, both in body and in spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the two of them tidied up and changed into fresh clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, all these years, everyone has missed you. We've all longed for the glorious days of the War Deities... Everyone is waiting for you to lead us back to the top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe said, her eyes gleaming with anticipation as she looked at Brian. "When will you begin to rebuild the War Deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Brian clenched his fists, his eyes burning with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once given up everything for Sophia, only to be met with insult and betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he would take back everything he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low and firm. "Zoe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Master!" Zoe responded, standing straight and bowing her head respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, notify the other members of the Four Lords and Twelve Blades. Secretly gather the War Deities from around the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In one year, I want the War Deities to rise again, and I will take the position of the Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's face lit up with fervor and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if struck by a thought, Brian added, "Also, I need you to help me investigate something quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to know who was behind the attempt on my life all those years ago, the one that led to my mother's death while trying to save me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded solemnly. "You can count on me. I'll investigate it thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead and get to work. I'll contact you if I need anything," Brian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded respectfully and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Celeste walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took in the disarray of the room, her brow furrowing. She looked at Brian with a gaze full of discontent and disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Brian to be so eager to indulge in pleasure with women just after being released from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, he seemed like nothing more than a decadent, irresponsible man, and her confidence in him crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't fathom how someone like him could possibly double the Trillion Group's worth in just one year, let alone compete for the position of Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She began to feel that coming here to assist Brian had been a huge mistake.</span></p></div>
