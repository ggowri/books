        <h1>Chapter 163 The Fall of Wolfgang</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice cut through the tension, sharp and commanding, startling everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe strode in, her black trench coat billowing slightly with each step. Beneath it, a slinky camisole and sheer stockings hugged her figure, exuding a dangerous, magnetic allure. Raven trailed close behind, his own presence icy and unyielding as they descended into the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Guzman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang's eyes widened. Fear and disbelief flickered across his face, his voice quivering as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's face was a mask of frost, her command booming with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang froze, utterly baffled. He had no idea why Zoe was demanding he grovel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, his respect, no, his fear, of her ran deep. He bowed his head, swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Guzman, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely got the words out before Zoe's hand cracked across his face with a vicious slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brainless fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow sent Wolfgang staggering, his cheek swelling instantly, a few teeth crumbling as blood trickled from his lips. Confusion swirled in his mind, heavier now than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is Ms. Guzman so furious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven watched from the sidelines, his eyes glinting with pity. He'd been through this wringer before and knew exactly how this played out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had made it crystal clear long ago. Brian was to be treated with the same deference as herself. But Wolfgang, that arrogant idiot, had clearly ignored her orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tucker, Lyle, and the others stood dumbfounded, their jaws slack. They couldn't wrap their heads around what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is Ms. Guzman siding with an outsider?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in a moment that left them reeling, their eyes nearly popped out of their skulls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, the infamous Crimson Demonic Ascendance, the terror of the underworld, strode straight to Brian and dropped to one knee before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards," she said, her voice low and laced with shame, "I've failed to discipline my people. I've let you down. Please, punish me as you see fit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What... What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang's mind imploded his thoughts into a chaotic whirlwind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never imagined Zoe, the invincible queen in his eyes, would kneel and apologize to anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to think, just moments ago, he'd been demanding Brian apologize to him, and worse, he'd dared to make a move on Brian's woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bone-deep chill shot through Wolfgang, from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. His entire body felt like it had been dunked in ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lyle and Tucker were equally stunned, their minds struggling to process the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could hardly believe their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, the unchallenged empress of Riverwood's underworld, a woman whose reputation sent shivers down spines, was publicly humbling herself before this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when facing titans like the mayor, Zoe had never so much as blinked, let alone apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, too, was floored, her exquisite face a canvas of shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind flashed back to the crisis at Trillion Group. Brian had swooped in with Zoe and her crew, resolving the mess with ruthless efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd assumed Brian and Zoe were just business associates, that Zoe's team was merely hired muscle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? It was clear Zoe wasn't just working with Brian. She was working for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has Brian been a player in the underworld all along?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just how many secrets is this man hiding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Celeste's curiosity about Brian burned brighter than ever, a spark of fascination igniting in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze fell on Zoe, cold and devoid of warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't the first time something like this has happened," he said, his voice flat but heavy with displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe trembled slightly, a flicker of panic and fear darting through her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she'd crossed a line this time, not just angering Brian but disappointing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd issued the directive after Raven's fiasco and made it loud and clear to everyone. And yet, here they were again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration and guilt churned in her gut, but she swallowed it down, taking a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards," she said, her tone resolute, "please don't be upset. I promise you, I'll handle this today and give you a resolution you'll find satisfactory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression didn't soften. "Get up," he said simply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe rose, her gaze snapping to Wolfgang, her face as cold as a winter storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wolfgang," she said, her voice dripping with menace, "it seems you didn't take my last announcement seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your... announcement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang's face paled as realization hit him like a freight train. His eyes darted to Brian, wide with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He... He's the Mr. Edwards from your announcement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's eyes were glacial. Without a word, she pulled a dagger from her coat and tossed it at Wolfgang's feet, the blade clattering ominously on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right," she said. "You know what to do next, don't you? Or do I need to spell it out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang stared at the dagger, his face ashen, sweat beading on his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Guzman, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth to plead, but Zoe's voice cut through like a whip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that? You want me to do it for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... no, I would do it myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang knew Zoe's strength, her ruthlessness. Defying her was a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the weight of everyone's stares, his trembling hands picked up the dagger. With a gritted-teeth grimace, he drove it into his own chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood was sprayed in a crimson arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang's eyes bulged, filled with regret and a desperate clinging to life before he collapsed into a lifeless heap in a pool of his own blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never dreamed that standing up for a friend would cost him everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Wolfgang's body sent a collective shudder through Lyle, Tucker, and the others. Fear gripped them, their souls practically fleeing their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In unison, they turned to Brian and Celeste, their voices quaking with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne... We were wrong. We're so sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, please, give us a chance to make this right. We'll work with Trillion Group, no strings attached, whatever it takes!"</span></p></div>
