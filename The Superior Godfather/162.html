        <h1>Chapter 162 The Deputy Leader of Shadow Fang</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Porter..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Lyle and his crew in such a pitiful state sent a wave of shock through the bald henchman and his group, their faces paling in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lyle's eyes burned with murderous rage. He jabbed a trembling finger at Brian and roared, "Take him down! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, Brian's figure blurred into motion. In a heartbeat, the bald henchman and over a dozen bodyguards were flung out of the private room like ragdolls, crashing into the walls with sickening thuds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian moved like a phantom, materializing in front of Lyle and his group in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their pupils shrank to pinpoints, sheer terror flooding their gazes as they stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected him to be this fast, this lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't even see how he moved. The bodyguards they had hired for an exorbitant fee, veterans from elite military units, had been taken out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, too, stood frozen, her jaw slightly slack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's speed was like a bolt of lightning, almost unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she'd seen was a shadow flickering through the crowd, too quick to track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... What do you want?" Lyle stammered, his voice trembling as Brian loomed closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm warning you," he added, teeth gritted, "I've got connections with the deputy leader of Shadow Fang..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were cut off as Brian's fist came hurtling toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch carried a raw, unstoppable force. With a sickening crack, blood sprayed everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lyle and his crew were sent flying, collapsing in heaps on the floor, clutching their stomachs or faces, writhing and groaning in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression didn't flicker. He stepped forward and pressed his foot down on Lyle's face, grinding it against the cold floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a voice laced with icy indifference, he asked, "What was that you were saying about Shadow Fang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lyle, blood streaming from his nose and mouth, hissed through clenched teeth, "I'm tight with Wolfgang, the deputy leader of Shadow Fang. I've already tipped him off. He's on his way with his crew, and when he gets here, you're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow Fang's deputy leader, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes glinted with a dangerous spark, a cold smirk tugging at his lips. "Fine. I'll wait right here and see what he can do to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled out his phone, fired off a quick text to Zoe, and sauntered back to his seat. He picked up his drink, took a leisurely sip, and grabbed a bite of food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste," he said casually, glancing over, "the food here's actually pretty damn good. Stop staring and dig in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste flashed a small, amused smile, nodded, and reached for her fork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been sipping wine all evening and hadn't touched the food yet. Her stomach was practically screaming for a bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lyle sprawled on the floor, and glared at them, his eyes blazing with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You smug bastards," he muttered under his breath. "Just wait till Wolfgang shows up. You'll be begging for mercy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut it," Brian snapped, his gaze sharpening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Lyle could spit out another word, Brian flicked his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piece of bread soared through the air and lodged itself squarely in Lyle's mouth, silencing him with a muffled choke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of heavy, rapid footsteps echoed from the corridor outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man with a snarling wolf's head tattooed on his neck stormed into the room, flanked by a pack of menacing thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell's got the guts to mess with my man?" he bellowed. "Get out here now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Lyle saw Wolfgang Coleman barge in, his face lit up with manic glee, muffled cries escaping around the bread still stuffed in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang's eyes landed on Lyle, and he froze, visibly stunned. He hadn't expected to find his friend in such a battered state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rushing over, he yanked the bread from Lyle's mouth and growled, "Lyle, what the hell happened? Who did this to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lyle's face twisted with rage as he pointed a shaking finger at Brian. "That guy! I want you to kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Lyle, take it easy. I've got this," Wolfgang said, helping Lyle to a chair before turning his attention to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze darkened, cold, and predatory. "Man, you've got some serious balls, laying hands on my friend. Are you tired of living or just stupid..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Wolfgang could finish his threat, his eyes drifted to Celeste, sitting beside Brian. His expression shifted, a hungry gleam sparking in his gaze. She was stunning. Her beauty hit him like a punch to the gut and those legs... They were enough to drive him wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy hell," he muttered, practically drooling. "This girl's a knockout. Those legs... Damn, they're something else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang had two vices&mdash;greed and lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had a particularly obsessive thing for feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's long, elegant legs had him practically vibrating with excitement, his blood roaring in his veins, his eyes glued to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, young man," he said, his tone dripping with sleaze. "Here's the deal. You apologize to my buddy, cough up fifty million dollars for his medical bills, and let me have some fun with your girl here. Do that, and maybe, just maybe, I'll let you walk out of here in one piece. How's that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face darkened instantly, a flicker of lethal intent flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could stomach Wolfgang showing up to back Lyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loyalty to a friend, sure, that was understandable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this creep daring to leer at Celeste, making vile demands? That crossed a line Brian couldn't ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea how Zoe had picked someone like this, a man drowning in his own depravity, to be Shadow Fang's deputy leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth," Brian barked, his voice like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wolfgang sneered, his lips curling with mockery. "You telling me to shut up? Man, do you even know who you're talking to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, a colder, sharper voice sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He asked you to shut up. Are you deaf?"</span></p></div>
