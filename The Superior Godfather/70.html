        <h1>Chapter 70 It Is Public</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's smile froze, and he instinctively clamped his thighs together, a surge of fear welling up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he really molested Celeste while drunk last night and she, in her anger, decided to cut it off, he'd be done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he quickly noticed some clues and inconsistencies, and started eyeing Celeste's hot figure with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, don't think I blacked out yesterday and remember nothing. If what you said is true, that I tried to... you know... then how do you explain the lipstick marks on my neck and face? You can't possibly say I forced you to kiss me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Celeste's expression froze, her face turning red with embarrassment. She didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, under Brian's intense advances last night, she couldn't help but respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't be bothered with you, you pervert!" She glared at Brian, grabbed her bag, and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, wait. Tell me, what was it like last night? I didn't experience anything at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you have any sense of responsibility? You took advantage of me and now you're just going to walk away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she heard Brian's words, Celeste was filled with exasperation. She halted, turned around, and shot Brian a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who took advantage of you? Even if I was drunk last night and wanted to, I couldn't do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked puzzled. "Couldn't do it? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're not even a man, it wouldn't even stand up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's words struck Brian hard, leaving him speechless and questioning everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a man? Can't stand up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian's expression of disbelief, Celeste almost burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing her amusement, she said seriously, "Exactly, you can't get it up. You pathetic eunuch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she walked off, leaving Brian in utter confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha!" As soon as she stepped out of the room, Celeste couldn't hold back her laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's confused look was so funny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if she thought of something, she slapped her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she remember she was here to discuss a company project with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she couldn't be bothered to go back and find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. I can't be bothered to talk to him. Anyway, the company isn't mine. If the project fails, so be it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At three o'clock in the afternoon, Brian arrived at the most famous Starry Sky Caf&eacute; in the city center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had arranged to meet him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because he arrived too early, Zoe hadn't shown up yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered a coffee, sat by the floor-to-ceiling window, and gazed out at the bustling city, lost in thought about his future path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His priority was to double Trillion Group's value and regain his place as the successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also had to quickly reorganize the War Deities, find the killer, avenge his mother, and fight for the Godfather's title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This couldn't be rushed. It would take time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brian was lost in thought, a fragrant breeze suddenly blew over him, and a pair of soft hands covered his eyes from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, you are naughty again." Smelling the familiar scent of her hair, Brian smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This game's no fun. You always guess right. Can't you at least pretend to guess wrong and let me win for once?" Zoe pouted and snuggled closer to Brian, wrapping her arms around his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure swayed with every movement, sending shivers through Brian, and he couldn't help but feel overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In public, mind your manners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe reluctantly released his arm and took a seat across from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's on your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't I come to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe leaned forward, resting her chin in her hands, casting a look full of longing at Brian, oblivious to how seductive the gesture appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dressed in a black corset and leather pants, her look exuding a mix of mature allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she leaned forward, her figure subtly pressed against the table, offering a fleeting glimpse of her smooth skin, leaving Brian clearly affected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Celeste's mocking words stirred a bitter feeling of indignation in Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Celeste, explain what you meant get it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, I'll make you feel it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Brian's gaze, Zoe smirked, deliberately tugging at her collar, her eyes gleaming with playful mischief, her breath slow and sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian snapped back to reality, tapped her head with his finger, and said irritably, "You look great, but you're so improper in public."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like me this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's smile grew wider as she placed her foot on Brian's thigh and gently rubbed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was taken aback by Zoe's boldness in public and quickly said, "Let's talk business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A teasing grin spread across her face as her high heels slowly rubbed against the middle of Brian's crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm helping you with business now."</span></p></div>
