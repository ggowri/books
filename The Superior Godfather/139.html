        <h1>Chapter 139 Added Insult to Injury</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, inside the headquarters building of Quadrillion Group, Denzel, Eric, Zac, and others watched this scene with a sneer on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas said with a look of disdain, "Solve the debt problems within today? As long as there is Brian, Trillion Group will never go bankrupt? Humph, he overestimates himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zac, Eric, Jensen, and others all echoed, "Exactly! He has no funds at all. No matter how capable he is, he can't solve any problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is simply a braggart. Let's just wait and watch the good show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't believe that Brian could go through the crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, only Denzel frowned. Somehow, he had a bad premonition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The confidence and composure that Brian showed were definitely not faked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Denzel's worry, Thomas smiled, "With the news of our withdrawal of investment being exposed and the news that Trillion Group is about to go bankrupt spreading, major banks and business partners are all demanding repayment from Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given Brian's connections, Mr. Vaughn, you don't really think that he has the ability to solve the financial problem, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's worry vanished when he heard this. He knew the working style of the Godfather very well. It was a test for Brian, and the Godfather would never send anyone to help Brian, even if someone wanted to kill Brian,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the reason why Denzel dared to target Brian like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as Denzel knew, Brian was the most mediocre one among all the heirs of the Godfather. With Brian's connections and abilities, no one would help him. His failure was a foregone conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Denzel smiled, "I was overthinking it. With Brian's ability, he can't solve any problems. Cheers! Let's toast to our upcoming success!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, Zac, Eric, and the others smiled and raised their glasses to clink with Denzel's. "Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the conference room of Trillion Group, the presidents of banks that had cooperated with Trillion Group and the bosses of companies had all gathered here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, when they faced Celeste and Damian, they had all shown extreme enthusiasm and respect. But now, each of them looked livid and glared at Celeste and Damian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people yelled, "Stop talking nonsense. Just give us a straightforward answer. When are you going to pay back the money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Brian? Where is he hiding? Let him get out and pay up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, if you can't come up with the money today, I'll have someone seal up Trillion Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Celeste and Damian looked angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, these presidents of banks and bosses of companies had begged them to cooperate with Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Trillion Group had just encountered a little problem, these guys didn't offer a helping hand, and they even added insult to injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a mistake that they had agreed to cooperate with these bastards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste suppressed the anger, took a deep breath, and said, "Everyone, please rest assured. Mr. Edwards has gone to raise funds, and he will pay back the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Ted Weber, the president of Riverwood Bank, sneered and asked sharply, "He will pay back the money? When? We want the money right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galen Hastings, the president of Hastings Construction Group, slapped the conference table hard. "That's right. It must be paid back immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riverwood Bank and Hastings Construction Group were Trillion Group's biggest business partners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, Trillion Group had given them a great deal of business and profits, especially Hastings Construction Group. It became one of the top three large construction companies in Azuriath State relying on the projects given by Trillion Group and had made a great fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Ted and Galen were the most aggressive ones. It didn't take much imagination to guess that there was no lack of instigation and support from Denzel and Thomas behind the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste' looked livid and said sullenly, "Mr. Weber, it was you who begged Mr. Edwards for the loan back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hastings, if it weren't for the support of Trillion Group, could you have come this far from being a foreman? I'm not asking you to offer a helping hand, but at least you shouldn't add insult to injury."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ted and Galen lost their temper and slapped the table hard. They yelled, "What do you mean? It's natural to pay back a debt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Call Brian out and pay back the money right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others echoed, "I'll give you five minutes. If you don't call that Brian out, I'll smash this place today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was furious. She was about to speak when a cold and domineering voice sounded, "Do you have the guts to smash this place?"</span></p></div>
