        <h1>Chapter 59 Appearance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's expression shifted as she pleaded, "Mr. Dunn, please give me more time. I will definitely pay you back for what I owe you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two years ago, her best friend came to her for help because her company's funding chain was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, considering their long-term friendship, she did not hesitate to borrow 20 million dollars in high-interest loans from a loan company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her friend vanished after receiving the money, leaving Karen with the debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, her salary was relatively high, and she could set aside part of the money every month to repay the loan shark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that she had lost her job, she had lost the ability to repay the debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've been patient long enough, "Mikael sneered, stared greedily at Karen's mature and sexy body, and licked his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Since you can't pay, you can pay with your body instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, my friends and I have been coveting your body for a long time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, he opened his arms and rushed towards her. "Come on, baby, let's have some fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was so frightened that her face turned pale and she stepped back repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne quickly grabbed a fruit knife from the table and positioned herself protectively in front of Karen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "What are you doing? I warn you, my sister is the president of the Evans Group, and her boyfriend is Ryan, the CEO of the Carter Group. If you try anything, you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mikael's expression shifted as he halted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard of the Evans Group and the Carter Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such large enterprises were not something they could afford to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloomily, he stared at Karen and said coldly, "Ms. Jones, you must repay your debts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For your friend's sake, I'll give you seven more days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't come up with the money, I'll sell you overseas as a prostitute. Your looks and demeanor are quite popular there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Mikael turned and left with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen sighed in relief after they departed and looked at Anne gratefully. "Anne, I owe you everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne asked in confusion, "Karen, your annual salary is so high. How come you owe usury?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen explained, "It's my best friend's fault. I borrowed 20 million dollars from a loan company at high interest rates to help her company, but she suddenly disappeared after she got the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was pained as she grasped Anne's hand, pleading, "Anne, I'm unemployed now. You have to help me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne smiled bitterly and said, "I can't raise that much, and the Evans Group is in jeopardy. Sophia can't help either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's bitterness deepened. "Then...then what should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne said, "Don't worry. We still have seven days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought for a moment and said, "Let's think of another way. If we can't find a solution, I'll ask Brian for help. He should have the funds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen nodded despondently. "That's all we can do for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already nine o'clock when Brian and Aria finished dinner in the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting to know each other over this meal, their relationship seemed to get along better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they parted, Aria hugged Brian again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Mr. Edwards, thank you very much for cooperating with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling her softness, Brian joked, "Ms. Jenkins, aren't you afraid that I will misunderstand you again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria froze, recalling the wonderful misunderstanding in the office, a blush instantly appeared on her beautiful cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Mr. Edwards, you're such a bad man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian laughed, "Women love bad men!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, I'm ignoring you!" She shot him a playful glare before getting into a waiting Rolls Royce and disappearing into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian drove his Pagani Viking to the Trillion Group headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to meet the company's shareholders and executives.</span></p></div>
