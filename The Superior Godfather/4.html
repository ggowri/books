        <h1>Chapter 4 Furious and Overcome</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the living room, Robert Evans and Mary Evans were having a pleasant conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Sophia's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had always looked down on Brian, often humiliating and tormenting him, pushing for Sophia to divorce him at every opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, seeing Anne lying there, battered and bruised, they were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they saw Brian walk in, their faces immediately darkened, their eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you worthless piece of trash! You've already been kicked out, and now you dare to come back and cause trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, have you lost your mind? I will kill you!" Robert cursed, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Robert raised his hand to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes grew cold, and with a swift motion, he returned the slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from Robert's mouth, and he was knocked back onto the couch, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, how dare you! I'll kill you!" Mary screamed, her face flushed with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lunged at Brian, but he slapped her away, sending her crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Anne's eyes turned red with anger. "Brian, you're looking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guards, get in here and take care of this bastard!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her command, more than a dozen bodyguards rushed in, their faces filled with bloodlust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They charged toward Brian, wielding electric batons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze sharpened, and in an instant, his energy surged through his body. Like a wild beast, he charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All anyone saw was a blur, and then they were sent flying by a massive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, over a dozen bodyguards lay on the floor, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... how is this possible?" Robert gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's supposed to be useless. How does he still have such fighting strength?" Mary exclaimed, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert, Mary, and Anne stared at Brian in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all assumed that Brian, having lost his energy, was nothing more than a cripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had once struggled to even do basic physical tasks. They never expected him to be so powerful now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian paid no attention to their stunned gazes. He simply walked upstairs and into his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he had left in the room was gone, even his cherished photo album.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned the room upside down, and finally, in the corner, he found a burnt photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The picture was of his gentle, kind mother when she was young, but the flames had scorched it beyond recognition. Her face was barely visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the ruined photo, memories of his mother flooded Brian's mind, and a wave of self-loathing washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother had died to save him, and this was the only memento he had left of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, this final piece of remembrance had been destroyed by Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, you vile woman..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rage inside Brian exploded. He stormed downstairs, dragged Anne into his room, and slammed the door shut with a resounding bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard has gone mad, quickly... quickly call Sophia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary, in a panic, scrambled to dial Sophia's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room, Anne screamed in terror as Brian threw her onto the bed with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed her hands against her chest, her eyes wide with fear as she stared at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, what... what are you going to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to understand, if you dare touch me, Sophia will never forgive you!" she threatened, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes were ice cold. "Do something to you? Anne, you really think too highly of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sneered, disdain dripping from her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, you sick pervert. Don't think I don't know your filthy thoughts... Do you dare to deny stealing my underwear, spying on me while I shower, or wanting to assault me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing but a cowardly pervert who can't even get it up!" she taunted, her voice filled with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face darkened with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her underwear had blown onto his balcony, and now she was accusing him of stealing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd left the door open while showering, and when he happened to walk by, she had claimed he was peeping. She even accused him of trying to assault her, sending him to the police station because of her lies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling the time when Anne had falsely accused him in front of the entire family, Brian's anger reached its breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her disdainful look still fresh in his mind, he couldn't take it any longer. He lunged at Anne, pinning her to the bed beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how you enjoy accusing me?" he snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You call me a cowardly pervert?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low and threatening as he continued, "You think I can't do anything about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'll show you just how wrong you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Brian tore off Anne's clothes.</span></p></div>
