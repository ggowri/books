        <h1>Chapter 151 Shocking Turn of Events</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza anxiously said, "The stock has dropped below ninety, Ms. Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia stared at the plummeting numbers on the screen, her fingers clenched tight around the edge of the desk. It felt like every point the stock fell was a punch to her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything she'd done to bring the Anastasia Group to where it was today, she was now forced to watch it spiral downward with no way to stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make things worse, her personal phone wouldn't stop ringing&mdash;message after message, call after call, all from shareholders demanding answers. Forcing herself to stay calm, she finally picked up the phone and sent a voice message to the group chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Rest assured, everyone. There's nothing wrong with the Anastasia Group. This is just a targeted hit from capital players. Give me three days. I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, a shareholder replied with a voice note, "You'd better fix it. Otherwise, don't expect us to stay loyal. Your competitors have been eager to win us over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that cold, matter-of-fact response made Anastasia's heart sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the CEO, sure&mdash;on the surface it looked like she had everything under control. But behind the scenes, she was constantly juggling impossible pressures. If she really lost the support of those key shareholders, it'd be a devastating blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia pushed herself to keep going, firing off several messages and strategy updates to the company's executive group chat. Once that was done, she looked ghostly pale, like someone had pulled the plug on her energy. She slumped into her chair, completely spent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There's nothing more I can do. I've done everything in my power. What happens now is out of my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza immediately panicked when she saw her like that. She rushed to her side, worry all over her face. "Ms. Vaughn? Are you okay? You're freaking me out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Anastasia replied, managing a strained smile. "I'm just... tired, that's all." As she spoke, she reached up to rub her temples, though inside, she felt nothing but bitter frustration and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza sighed, "Ms. Vaughn, we need a big cash injection to stabilize things. If we can get enough money, there's still hope. What if we go to Brian and try to get that money back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia let out a tired, humorless laugh and shook her head. "Even if we did get that money back, it wouldn't make much of a difference now. Unless we have hundreds of billions of dollars pouring in, we can't reverse this. Besides, Brian already used it to get Trillion Group out of trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So we're just supposed to sit here and wait for things to fall apart?" Eliza's hands balled into fists, frustration written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew better than anyone how hard Anastasia had worked to bring the Anastasia Group to where it was today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza was just about to say something when Anastasia suddenly cut in, "Send out the order&mdash;pull out of the market rescue plan. Use every last penny to go after Glory Group. If he wants to play hardball, we'll play dirty. Worst case? We both go down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she heard that, her expression shifted dramatically. She hadn't expected Anastasia to be this intense and unyielding, going toe-to-toe with Denzel and ready to drag them both down if it came to that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza was about to carry out the order when she noticed something strange&mdash;the company's stock prices were rising. Quickly, she said, "Ms. Vaughn, the company's stocks are climbing... and there's over a hundred billion dollars flowing into our market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia blinked. "What?" The sudden turn of events completely threw her. Staring at the flood of hundreds of billions pouring in, watching the stock price climb higher and higher, she was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell is going on? Who is pulling strings behind the scenes to help me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia took a deep breath, trying to calm the surge of emotions before asking in a low voice, "Can we trace where that money's coming from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza responded quickly, "Not exactly. There's no clear trail, but it's all coming from overseas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Overseas?" Anastasia frowned, confusion flickering across her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I don't know a single major investor abroad. So who is backing me in the dark?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anastasia was puzzling over it, Eliza suddenly exclaimed, "Ms. Vaughn, you need to look at Glory Group's stock price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about it?" Anastasia asked, frowning as she stared at the stock chart in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second later, her eyes widened in shock, her face full of disbelief. Glory Group's stock was plummeting&mdash;crashing even faster than the Anastasia Group's had during its worst dip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that wasn't all&mdash;the lower right corner of the screen suddenly popped up with a news alert exposing dirt on Denzel and Glory Group. When Anastasia clicked in, what she found inside was brutal, hard-hitting, and thorough. Within minutes, the scandals were everywhere online, spreading like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Denzel's reputation was in ruins, and Glory Group's stock value had been slashed in half, again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia muttered, "What... What the hell is happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who has the power and guts to pull off something like this from the shadows?" Eliza asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both women stood there, stunned. Their chests rose and fell rapidly, hearts pounding as a storm of thoughts raged inside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Denzel had no idea any of this was happening. At that very moment, he was in his office, tangled up with his sexy assistant, deep in the throes of pleasure.</span></p></div>
