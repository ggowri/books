        <h1>Chapter 97 Mission</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian kept closing the gap, the two assassins swiftly hurled their daggers at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blades cut through the air like streaks of light, but with a simple motion, Brian caught both daggers effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he flicked his wrists and sent the daggers flying back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The daggers struck the assassins' thighs with pinpoint accuracy, and they screamed in pain, stumbling as they crashed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Brian closing in, their faces turned pale. Ignoring the searing pain in their legs, they unleashed their remaining energy and threw a hidden weapon at him, gritting their teeth as they tried to flee once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of their escape seemed even swifter than before, fueled by their energy. They darted off like shadows, hoping to vanish into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Brian dodged the weapon and closed in, moving faster than they could react. With one powerful strike, his palms slammed into their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from their mouths as they were hurled through the air like broken kites, crashing onto the ground, unable to get up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stood above them, his cold gaze fixed on the two assassins lying on the grass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me. Who sent you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins' faces were ashen, their eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never imagined this man could be so strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men, Cole and Derek, were high-ranking members of the Peerless Sect, the largest assassin organization in Aurop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had recently heard that their leader, Sam, had merged the Peerless Sect with the War Deities. While on their way to Riverwood to meet the Master of the War Deities, they had taken on a quick bounty from the Dark Web for a side job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they thought would be a simple task had ended in disaster, falling into the hands of this mysterious, seemingly ordinary man. Their pride was shattered, and they were desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dude, this must be a misunderstanding..." they stammered, trying to save themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression grew colder. "You came to kill me, and now you're calling it a misunderstanding? That's pretty laughable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian prepared to act, Cole and Derek quickly explained, "It really was a misunderstanding. We're top-tier members of the Peerless Sect. After hearing that our leader merged us with the War Deities, we came here to meet the War Deities' Master. In the meantime, we picked up a simple assassination mission for a five-million-dollar bounty...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We really don't know who's behind the mission. If you let us go, we swear we'll never forget this favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes pleaded with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're from the Peerless Sect?" Brian raised an eyebrow, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard about the Peerless Sect from Sam recently, and he had agreed to merge the sect into the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know the Peerless Sect?" Both assassins' faces lit up with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering, Brian pulled out his phone and dialed Sam. "Get over here and take care of your men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end, Sam was utterly confused. "Mr. Edwards, what men?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hung up without explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting by the pool, Sam, cigarette in hand, glanced nervously at Zoe lounging in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, what's going on? Why did Mr. Edwards call me to 'take someone'? What do you think this is about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe stretched lazily, her perfect figure gleaming in the sunlight as she flashed him a playful grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know, but it can't be good. You'd better figure it out, my friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn..." With a sigh, Sam made his way to Brian's place, his mind racing with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, you called me here in such a hurry. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you ask me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression darkened as he tossed Cole and Derek in front of Sam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, are these two your men?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's face went pale as he stared at the assassins in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cole? Derek? What are you two doing here?"</span></p></div>
