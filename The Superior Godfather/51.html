        <h1>Chapter 51 Celeste's Fury</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert's voice suddenly rose. "What did you say? You couldn't even last four moves against him, and that included the three moves he let you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware of Eliza's prowess. Even among the elite of the Vaughn family, she was a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she couldn't withstand a single move from Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news was a bombshell to Herbert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza nodded and replied, "Yes, Mr. Vaughn. Mr. Edwards is an incredibly low-key powerhouse, with an amazing healing ability! Oh, and he's also a fantastic cook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert frowned. "His cooking? What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza licked her lips, savoring the memory of the delicious meal. "Ms. Vaughn and I had dinner at his place. His cooking is out of this world&mdash;better than any five-star chef."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had tasked Eliza and Anastasia with testing Brian, but instead, they were raving about his culinary skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath to calm himself, Herbert asked, "Are you serious? He really took you down in one move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely. Mr. Edwards is that strong. If Ms. Vaughn could get his help, she might actually have a shot at beating the other heirs and becoming the next head of the Vaughn family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert was stunned into a long silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he spoke, "This is the first time I've ever seen you speak so highly of someone. It seems Brian really has something special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given that, you two should stay put in Riverwood for now and get on Brian's good side. Try to win his support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The other heirs have already found out you're in Riverwood and are sending people to take action. Be careful, And don't worry Anastasia about family matters&mdash;I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Vaughn. Take care," Eliza replied before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the dining room, Eliza relayed Herbert's message to Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply nodded without saying much, her eyes fixed on Brian as he tidied up the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "It looks like my father is starting to see this man's worth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Anastasia's gaze, Brian asked, puzzled, "Rachael, why are you staring at me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled brightly, "Because you're just so handsome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At five in the afternoon, after Brian had seen Anastasia and Eliza off, he received a call from Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, when can you get here? Thomas is leading the shareholders and executives in a revolt. I can't hold them off much longer." Celeste sounded frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian could sense the immense pressure she was under, but he remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let them wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian did this not only to test Celeste's capabilities but also because he needed to see Aria first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to outsource the Weston development project to Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, even if the shareholders and executives of Trillion Group found out he was also the boss of Transcendent Construction Group and had orchestrated the entire investment charade, they'd be powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the Trillion Group headquarters, in the boardroom, all the shareholders and executives had gathered under the instigation of the second-largest shareholder, Thomas. They were pressuring Celeste for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Celeste hung up the phone, Thomas snapped, "Celeste, what did the chairman say? When is he planning to show up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste put her phone down and looked at Thomas with a calm gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The chairman said to keep waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' face darkened, and he slammed his hand on the conference table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've been waiting all day, and he still wants us to wait? He's really putting on airs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other shareholders chimed in, "This is outrageous! He's just showing off his power! I'm pulling out my investment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, let's all pull out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was furious with the new chairman, who hadn't even made an appearance yet. They didn't even know what he looked like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes turned cold as she exuded an air of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to pull out your investments, do you? On behalf of the chairman, I agree. Anyone who wants to withdraw should line up and register with my secretary, Ella."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste called over Ella Cooper and slammed a notebook onto the desk. "You were just talking about pulling out, right? Come on, sign up here!"</span></p></div>
