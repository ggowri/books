        <h1>Chapter 68 Just Brian?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news Eric brought hit Kevin hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in a daze, barely remembering how he ended up back in his cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, what's going on? What happened?" Seeing Kevin's distraught expression, Ethan grew anxious and urgently slapped his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, don't scare me! Please say something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, Kevin finally snapped back to reality, his face twisted with bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, we're done for. We might never get out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew all too well the power and influence of the chairman of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Brian was really the new chairman, there was no way Thomas could bring him down so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's face turned pale at the news, and he quickly said, "Why we can't get out? Kevin, what's going on? Didn't you say Thomas would save us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin let out a weary sigh and told Ethan about Eric's visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was shocked. He was too stunned to think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So is Brian the new chairman of Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin nodded with a pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's true. My uncle got caught up in this and became his target. And Eric got demoted to the Propaganda Department. They can't even protect themselves now, so getting us out anytime soon is out of the question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... how did it come to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Ethan's face drained of color in an instant. He didn't expect things to turn out like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a prison guard walked in. "Ethan, your son is here to see you. Come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to him!" Ethan's eyes flickered with surprise, and he hurriedly added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the guard's supervision, he was led to Ryan and Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, how are you? Are you used to being in there?" Seeing Ethan's disheveled state, Ryan felt distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every day in prison, Ethan endured violence, but he didn't want his son to worry. Trying to act unaffected, he said, "I...I'm fine. But I have something very important to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Sophia were both shocked and asked quickly, "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's face hardened, his eyes burning with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never expected that Brian would be the chairman of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, he asked, "Do you know why we lost to Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan looked confused. "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's fists clenched tightly, his eyes flashing with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because that fool, Brian, is the new chairman of Trillion Group. He set up that investment conference just to play us all for fools."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Brian is the chairman of Trillion Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face went pale, and he stood up sharply, staring at Ethan in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia shook her head in disbelief. "This can't be real. How could Brian be the chairman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Brian had always been a nobody, without any status or value at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had transformed into the chairman of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news was too much to process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the truth." Seeing their skepticism, Ethan took a deep breath and explained everything that had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face contorted with rage, his fists tightening so hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of this was part of Brian's scheme to get revenge on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this game, was I just a pawn, played by Brian all along?" Ryan thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news struck Ryan, crushing his dignity and leaving him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia was struck numb, her face paling instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia had once wondered why Brian was so confidently competing with Ryan for the partnership of Trillion Group. Now, it all made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "It turns out that this bastard is the new chairman of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... why is it that I'm only just finding out now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had I known earlier that Brian is the chairman of Trillion Group, I never would have betrayed him, let alone divorced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I had not divorced, I would now be the wife of the chairman of Trillion Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of this, Sophia felt conflicted, a trace of regret rising in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her pride wouldn't allow her to regret, let alone humble herself before Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Ryan beside her, linking her arm with his, and said coldly, "What's a mere Trillion Group compared to the War Deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if that loser Brian is the chairman? As long as you, my dear, gain the approval of the War Deities' leader and join the War Deities, he will still be crushed under your heel!"</span></p></div>
