        <h1>Chapter 166 Sparks in the Car</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ferrari tore through the city streets like a wild stallion, leaving every other car in its dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Celeste felt like she was strapped into a rollercoaster, the car swaying and weaving with exhilarating precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seatbelt hugged her chest tightly, and with every sharp turn, her curves bounced in a way that was impossible to ignore, drawing the eye with every motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian caught the sight in the rearview mirror, a devilish smirk creeping across his face. With a deft flick of the wheel, he executed a slick drift to overtake a slower car, then floored the gas, the engine roaring as they surged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reckless drifts and lightning-fast maneuvers only amplified the motion in Celeste's chest, her figure swaying hypnotically. Brian's throat went dry, his pulse quickening at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, meanwhile, clung to the armrest, her body pressed back into the seat, caught up in the thrill of speed. The rush was intoxicating, a heady mix of adrenaline and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, she hadn't expected Brian's driving to be this good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A trip that normally took her forty minutes was over in a blistering ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Ferrari finally glided to a smooth stop in front of her villa, Celeste let out a long, relieved breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Brian, she flashed a teasing grin. "I had no idea you were such a hotshot behind the wheel. Your driving's amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian matched her grin with one of his own, his tone playful. "You think that's impressive? There's something else I'm even better at. Way more skilled, and I can keep it up for hours. Wanna find out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste arched a brow, curiosity flickering in her eyes. "Something else? Like what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian winked, his voice dropping to a suggestive murmur. "Take a guess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you perv!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realization hit, and Celeste's cheeks flared bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe he'd say something so brazen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian feigned indignation, crossing his arms. "I was talking about bumper cars! What's so pervy about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bumper cars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste blinked, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, what'd you think I meant?" he shot back, barely suppressing a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flustered, Celeste scrambled to change the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you got to touch my leg already. Time to hold up your end of the deal. Tell me about your past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian paused, his expression turning thoughtful. "My past? It's pretty much what your research turned up. Compared to the other heirs, I'm just a regular guy. Not much to tell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes narrowed, her voice sharp with irritation. "Are you messing with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you teased me first," Brian said with a mock cough, dodging her glare. "Consider us even."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way was he spilling his life story to Celeste. Keeping her guessing, he figured, was the key to keeping her intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the more curious she was, the more chances he'd get to... Well, have some fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste raised a hand, ready to swat him, but Brian cut her off, his tone earnest now. "I'm serious, there's nothing juicy to share. But if you're so keen on digging deeper, we could always find a quiet spot and... get to know each other better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brow shot up again. "Get to know each other better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes gleamed with mischief as he winked. "Yeah, you in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's lips curved into a sly, almost challenging smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean the kind of 'getting to know' where neither of us is wearing clothes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian could respond, Celeste lunged forward, seizing his ear and giving it a fierce twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow! Let go, that hurts!" he yelped, squirming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still want to 'get to know me' now?" she demanded, her voice dripping with mock menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian opened his mouth to protest, but his words died as his gaze dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's movement had caused her neckline to dip, revealing a tantalizing glimpse of cleavage framed by the delicate purple lace of her bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was less than a foot away from her, close enough to catch the faint, intoxicating scent of her perfume mingled with a hint of something sweeter, almost creamy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath hitched, and he swallowed hard, utterly distracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, oblivious to the effect she was having, pressed on, her tone sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well? Answer me! You still want to 'get to know me'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go, it hurts... ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she twisted harder, Brian seized the moment. With a playful lurch, he let his face fall forward, burying it right into the softness of her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was heavenly. It was warm, plush, and impossibly inviting. He let out a muffled, contented sigh, his cheek pressed against her curves, reveling in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her scent enveloped him, and, acting on pure instinct, he flicked out his tongue for the briefest taste...</span></p></div>
