        <h1>Chapter 89 You're Incredible</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night stretched on, a blend of contentment and quiet intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa felt like a private world where Brian and Karen grew closer with every passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Karen wasn't experienced, her understanding of sex was impressive, and her flexibility added a new dimension to their connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end of the night, they had shared countless moments, each one leaving them feeling more connected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, you're incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, lying peacefully in Brian's embrace, wore a look of deep satisfaction, her face reflecting admiration and a sense of fulfillment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that quiet aftermath, she felt a shift, something within her that made her see him not just as a partner, but as someone she wanted to trust, someone to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian grinned as he squeezed her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always thought you were so refined, but turns out you're a lot more... fun than I thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her hip a playful tap, the sound ringing out in the quiet room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen shot him a flirtatious look, rolling her eyes slightly as she murmured, "You're such a pain..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her look of vulnerability, Brian felt a strong pull toward her, his desire intensifying. He moved in closer, but Karen gently stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She motioned to her chest, her voice soft and a bit hesitant. "Could you focus on this instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The discomfort from the previous night lingered, and she was hoping for something gentler, a change of pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared at the tempting pair, swallowing hard before he spoke in a low voice, "Hold it right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm ready. Just enjoy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen wrapped her breasts around his hardness, her hands carefully holding them in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the softness and warmth, Brian couldn't hold back any longer and sped his advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the bed started to shake, and the room echoed with a steady, rhythmic sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Brian and Karen walked out of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her black stockings had been torn by Brian the night before and she didn't have a spare pair, her long, toned legs were now fully exposed. Without the stockings, they looked even more shapely and alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her mature curves and professional attire, she definitely stood out, and Brian couldn't help but steal a couple more glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen noticed his gaze and flashed him a smug smile. She snorted softly, then straightened her back, putting on her usual haughty, aristocratic demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Brian slapped her firm, shapely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen gasped, her face flushing bright red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected him to act this way in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and resentment burned in her eyes as she shot him a glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow, clearly unfazed. "What's with that look? You still want me to help you with that loan shark debt or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen immediately hooked her arm around his, switching to a softer tone. "But we're outside, Brian... What if someone sees us? Please, have some mercy and spare me a little dignity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, her phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anne calling. "Karen, how did it go with Brian yesterday? Did he agree to help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's mind flashed back to how she'd begged Brian the night before, and a wave of frustration and embarrassment washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed, replying in a low voice, "Anne, I really owe you one for talking to him. He agreed to help. I'm taking him to the loan place now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Once you're done, we should grab a bite together. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen hesitated, unsure how to face Anne after everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, she said, "Let's see how things go. We've just arrived at the loan place, so I'll call you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They soon arrived at Dylan Reed's load company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Karen? We spent all night looking for you, and now you just walk in like it's no big deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw her, the men standing at the door were caught off guard, clearly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They remembered her all too well. Her seductive, mature figure had definitely left an impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lot of the men at the company had secretly hoped to get a chance with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when they found out she couldn't pay the debt, they spent the whole night searching for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd thought she'd run off, but here she was, showing up willingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men could barely hide their excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen shot them a cold look, crossing her arms over her chest. "Go tell Mr. Reed. I'm here to pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll go tell the boss right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men quickly turned and ran upstairs to inform Dylan.</span></p></div>
