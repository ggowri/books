        <h1>Chapter 132 The Fall of Trillion Group</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Denzel's behind-the-scenes manipulation and strategic media coverage, news of the mass exodus led by Thomas&mdash;shareholders and executives collectively abandoning Trillion Group&mdash;spread like wildfire throughout Riverwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The story dominated headlines across major news outlets, sending shockwaves through the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trillion Group had been the leader in Azuriath State's real estate sector, experiencing meteoric growth and commanding an impressive market presence. They had recently secured a major development project in Weston, with plans to transform it into the southwest region's premier commercial hub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their future had seemed limitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden departure of Eric and other senior executives and shareholders left the public shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many initially dismissed it as fake news, unable to believe such a devastating blow to the company's leadership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Thomas and his associates quickly dispelled any doubts by appearing alongside media outlets to confirm their withdrawal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They placed the blame squarely on Brian, Trillion Group's new chairman, publicly questioning his leadership capabilities and releasing details about his background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelations sparked an unprecedented uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Thomas to expose Brian's information, and the public was shocked to learn that Trillion Group's new chairman came from such humble origins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many found it hard to understand and accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news triggered a firestorm of online discussion and debate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[No wonder Mr. Thomas and his team jumped ship. Who would trust a company run by a nobody?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mr. Reynolds must have lost his mind to hand over his shares and chairmanship to someone the Evans family cast aside.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[How could someone like that possibly manage a corporation of this size? Thomas and his team made the only sensible choice by pulling out.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Trillion Group's stock has hit rock bottom two days running. They've lost more than half their market value. It's over for them!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in an upscale club, Denzel reclined lazily across the laps of two supermodels, enjoying their massage while scrolling through the online firestorm on his phone. A satisfied smile played across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see you get out of this one, Brian," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Evans Villa, Anne had spent days confined to her bedroom, deeply depressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's threats still haunted her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an urgent knocking at her door interrupted her brooding. Her parents' voices carried through: "Anne, open up! We've got amazing news&mdash;Brian is over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne rushed to the door, her heart racing. "What do you mean, 'over'? What's happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert replied, "It's all over the internet! After Brian took over Trillion Group, all the major shareholders were unhappy about that. Now they've pulled out en masse and jumped ship to other companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thomas exposed his background to the public, and everyone's tearing him apart online. Trillion Group's market value has been cut in half in just two days. Partners are terminating contracts left and right. The whole company's about to go under.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, Brian will become a pauper. Karma caught up with him faster than we expected!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stood frozen, processing the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd learned from her parents about Brian becoming Trillion Group's chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never imagined he could lose everything so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many thoughts flooded her mind: Where was he now? How was he coping? Would he hurt himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, I need to go out," she said abruptly. "Don't wait up for dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could respond, she had changed and rushed out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary watched her daughter's retreating figure with a puzzled frown. "Where is she going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Probably off to celebrate with her friends," Robert said dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither parent had any idea of Anne and Brian's relationship, assuming their daughter shared their hatred of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert grinned. "Let's call Sophia and share the good news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope everything is going well in Poskon and that she's found Luna."</span></p></div>
