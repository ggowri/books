        <h1>Chapter 29 The Arrogant Vice President</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by, and soon, it was the following afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than a day remained until the Trillion Group's investment conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste arrived at Brian's villa to report on the work situation and progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I've secretly obtained information about Kevin taking bribes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's been pushing for the Carter Group to become our development partner for the Weston project because Ethan, Ryan's father, transferred 150 million dollars to his private account."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and fifty million dollars? He sure has a big appetite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled with satisfaction as he looked at the documents Celeste handed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good work. Get ready to submit this to the police and prosecutor's office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste hesitated before speaking, "Mr. Edwards, Kevin's uncle is the company's second-largest shareholder. Are you sure we should move against him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we take action against Kevin, his uncle will withdraw his investment. It probably led to a mass exodus of employees. The whole company would fall into chaos. This would severely impact our operations and could even crash our stock price. We can't afford these consequences right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you can't stand corruption, and Kevin deserves whatever's coming to him... but this isn't the right time to strike. Why don't we give him one chance for now? Maybe you should meet with him first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt that since Brian had just become chairman, wasn't entirely familiar with the company's internal structure, and hadn't wholly secured his position, such a drastic move would intensely blow the company's development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Celeste's words, Brian pondered momentarily before nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to see just what kind of person this Kevin was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said firmly, "Alright, I'll take your advice and give him one chance. Please set up a meeting, but I won't go as the company chairman. Instead, I'll meet him as the owner of the Transcendent Construction Group you created for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give me a minute to call him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste pulled out her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to her explanation, Kevin thought momentarily before responding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Fine, Ms. Hawthorne. I'll meet this kid from Transcendent Construction, but I'm only doing this as a favor to you. I'm in my office. Bring him over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Celeste escorted Brian to the Trillion Group headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Riverwood's largest corporation, Trillion Group's headquarters was imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main building stood 58 stories tall, with Kevin's office on the 56th floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Celeste and Brian entered Kevin's office, they found him lounging on the couch, his arms wrapped around two women, his secretary on the left and his assistant on the right. He was flirting with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various stockings and adult toys were scattered on the table nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His debauchery made both Celeste and Brian frown in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Kevin noticed them, a flash of annoyance crossed his face, but he didn't bother to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawthorne, make yourself at home... If you want a drink, help yourself," he said dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her position as company president, he showed zero respect for Celeste, treating her like some low-level employee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his gaze to Brian and asked with casual indifference, "Is this the Transcendent Construction Group owner you told me about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face darkened at Kevin's dismissive attitude, and she nodded while suppressing her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this is Brian Edwards, the owner of Transcendent Construction Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin kissed his beautiful secretary's cheek and asked lazily, "So, kid, what do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint flashed in Brian's eyes at Kevin's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was indeed a cancer in the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fighting back his anger, Brian gave Kevin a bank card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, I'm Brian from Transcendent Construction Group. I'm here to discuss becoming your partner in developing the Weston property. This card contains 30 million dollars, just a small token of goodwill. There'll be plenty more in it for you once the deal goes through..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty million dollars to become Trillion Group's partner? You've got some nerve, kid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's eyes flashed with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the bank card and slapped it against Brian's face the next moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell do you think this is, throwing pennies at a beggar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden turn of events left Celeste shocked, her face changing dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Kevin to be bold enough to lay hands on Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face turned ice cold at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had initially followed Celeste's advice to give this guy a chance, but now he saw that was unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to speak, Celeste jumped in with a demand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, what do you think you're doing? I order you to apologize to Mr. Edwards right now."</span></p></div>
