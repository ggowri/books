        <h1>Chapter 60 I Am the Chairman</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Trillion Group Headquarters, although it was already ten o'clock in the evening, the conference room was still brightly lit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, looking chic in a red dress, reclined elegantly, sipping coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders and executives either played with their phones or dozed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their exhausted appearance formed a sharp contrast with Celeste, who was full of energy and spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, they would typically be enjoying intimate moments with their partners in bed or socializing with friends at bars or clubs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such endless waiting was simply a torment for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they just couldn't leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the second largest shareholder, Thomas had never suffered such injustice. He could no longer suppress his anger and slapped the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "That's enough! This farce needs to end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, either call the chairman and ask him to come over immediately, or we adjourn. It's your choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the third largest shareholder, Damian Phillips, echoed, "We have been waiting for him here for a whole day, which is already enough to give him face. But he still hasn't come yet. He is simply making a fool of us. This is too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, who had been holding a lot of anger, slammed the table and echoed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. This is too much. I won't do this anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm done with this too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste raised her eyebrows, about to respond, when a cold, dignified voice interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone doesn't want to work, you can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden sound startled everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under their astonished gazes, Brian entered with a commanding presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Brian from Transcendent Construction Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing who was coming, everyone at the scene couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those senior executives who knew Brian were confused about his purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, the general manager of marketing, challenged him sternly, "Brian, this is a Trillion Group meeting. What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was not only Kevin's direct subordinate but also Thomas' nephew and confidant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was full of hostility towards Brian for teaming up with Celeste against Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Celeste was about to stand up, but Brian gave her a look and stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up at Eric and said grimly, "As a partner of Trillion Group, can't I come here to take a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Eric's eyes flashed with disdain, and he sneered, "Partner of Trillion Group? You are really good at flattering yourself. Does your new company even have the right to work with us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ask everyone if they recognize your status as a partner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They viewed Brian as a fool and didn't take him seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their opinion, the reason why the chairman chose to cooperate with Brian's company was that he was completely fooled by Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the chairman arrived, they planned to ask him to cancel the cooperation with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undeterred by their mockery, Brian asserted, "What do you mean? Is this funny?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you, my status as a partner was approved by your chairman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, the laughter intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Brian like looking at a funny guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric scoffed, "The chairman was deceived by Celeste into choosing your subpar company. Do you really think he would have selected Transcendent Construction Group otherwise?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the chairman arrives, we'll not only demand the cancellation of your partnership but also urge an investigation into Celeste's misuse of power and negligence of her duties. You'll be finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Brian couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "What if I tell you I am the chairman you are waiting for?"</span></p></div>
