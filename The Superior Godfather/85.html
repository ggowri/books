        <h1>Chapter 85 Only He Could Help</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Karen... I... mm... I heard it... oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While sucking Brian's member, Anne murmured softly, her voice breathless, "Don't worry, mm... I've already come up with a plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the line, Karen's face lit up. "What's the plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... mm... yeah... mm-hmm... ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne was about to speak, Brian pressed her down on the sofa, rushed into her from behind, and started thrusting quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden rush of sensation made Anne's breath hitch, and she struggled to keep quiet, worried that Karen on the other end of the phone might notice. She pressed her hand over her mouth, trying to hold back the sounds building up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, watching her struggle, couldn't hide the sly grin spreading across his face. His movements became quicker, more deliberate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation intensified, sweeping through every inch of her body. Despite her best efforts to remain composed, a soft sound escaped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strange sound on the phone made Karen frown with concern. She quickly asked, "Anne, what's going on? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... no, Karen, I just... um... had a little accident. I... I slipped, and it really hurts... ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anne could finish, a pained cry escaped her lips as Brian's movements became faster, sending waves of pleasure through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's worry flared up at Anne's cry. "Anne, where are you hurt? Send me your address. I'll come right over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Karen, it's... it's nothing serious. I just twisted my ankle a little... I'll be fine after some rest..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne spoke in a labored voice, struggling to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had plans to meet Brian. I'm heading to his villa now. I'll send you the address, and you should come, too. He's the only one who can help you right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll be there soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sending you the address."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Karen could respond, Anne ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the address, she looked over at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you've got the upper hand, huh? Well, now it's my turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she pushed him back onto the sofa and climbed on top of him, ready to take control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A little over ten minutes later, as a wave of satisfaction swept through Anne, she collapsed onto the sofa, breathless and completely spent. Her eyes, when they met Brian's, were filled with a mixture of frustration and mild reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had her answer the phone on purpose, nearly making a fool of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile tugged at the corner of Brian's mouth as he lightly lifted her chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, when we're together, I want you to call Sophia. Be ready for that," he said with a teasing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Sophia found out about them, she would definitely lose it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to respond, Brian gave her a silencing gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Better clean up. Karen will be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne quickly started straightening things up, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't risk Karen noticing anything. It would cause serious problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Karen arrived at the address Anne had sent her, standing at the entrance of the lavish villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she took in the grandeur of the place, a swirl of complex emotions crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that the man she had once looked down on, Brian, had transformed into one of the most influential figures in Riverwood, now sitting on a fortune worth billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mix of anticipation and nervousness, she pushed open the door and stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Karen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face brightened as she hurried over to greet her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze sharpened, a look of admiration flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, having spent the day job hunting, was dressed in a professional outfit that only enhanced her elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair was styled up, revealing her refined features, and her tall figure looked even more poised in a white blouse, black pencil skirt, and heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gold-rimmed glasses added a sophisticated touch, and her presence exuded the confidence of a successful office worker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she moved, her graceful strides seemed to capture everyone's attention, the sway of her walk leaving a lasting impression.</span></p></div>
