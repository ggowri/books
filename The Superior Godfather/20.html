        <h1>Chapter 20 Shocking Everyone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... What did you say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian... is the owner of Riverside Villa No. 9? That can't be right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's eyes widened in shock, her expression contorting into one of pure disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, Robert, and Mary stood frozen in place, their mouths agape, as if they'd just witnessed something impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ryan, who'd always prided himself on being the one with the sharpest instincts, was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never, in a million years, expected Brian to have the financial means to buy a villa in a place like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stood there in stunned silence, Anastasia's lips curled into a subtle, almost playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what was it you were saying earlier? That Brian doesn't have the money for a house?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like you've got a pretty good look at how things really are now, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their efforts to deny it, Sophia, Robert, and Mary still couldn't quite believe their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! This... this must be some kind of scam! There's no way a loser like him could afford this. That property deed has to be fake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's laugh was sharp and biting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flipped open the deed with one hand, casually pointing to Brian's name on the document. "Fake? Really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a good look at it. This is his name. It's real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And even if you still doubt it, you think the sales consultant and manager are all in on some fake scheme, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager, clearly used to handling skeptical clients, straightened up with quiet professionalism, unfazed by the hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, we don't deal with fakes here. Mr. Edwards really did purchase Riverside Villa No. 9. And the price? Fifty-eight million dollars. Paid in full. All cash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifty-eight million... in cash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face drained of color. Robert and Mary were no better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of that amount made them dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could someone like Brian have come up with that much? He had been completely empty-handed after his divorce. It didn't add up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes darted back and forth between Brian and the deed in his hand, her face a picture of confusion and disbelief. It was as if she were seeing him for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's expression tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of money wasn't something that could be pulled out of thin air, and it certainly wasn't something he'd ever expect from someone like Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, however, remained completely relaxed. He casually waved his hand at the sales manager, as if the amount of money being discussed was no more significant than pocket change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a small sum. Nothing to get worked up about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words dropped like a hammer, and the room seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like something clicked in Sophia's mind, and she shot an angry glare at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, where the hell did you get all this money? Did you secretly steal from the company and stash it away when I wasn't looking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary immediately jumped in to back her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia's right! This guy must've swiped company funds. There's no other way he could have so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but chuckle at their accusations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You people really have a talent for looking down on others, huh? Sophia, if you wanna know whether I've been stealing from your company, just call the finance department and check. It'll be obvious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary quickly urged, "Yeah, go ahead and call them, Sophia. Find out for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really have been stealing company funds, I'll make sure you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia shot him a venomous look, then pulled out her phone to call the finance department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Mary eagerly asked, "Well? What did they say? Did he really steal from the company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face turned even darker as she stared at Brian, shaking her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary exchanged confused looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... where did he get the money to buy a villa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, who had been quietly observing, also looked at Brian with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, on the other hand, couldn't help but sneer, "Where else would it come from? Obviously, it's his own money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's expression turned cold, and she shot Brian a deadly look. "Brian, I didn't realize you were hiding all this money from me. But you think this is going to make me regret anything? You're wrong. It won't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trillion Group's investment conference starts the day after tomorrow, and the Carter Group is going to be their partner. You? You're just some bottom-dwelling nobody, and you'll never be in his league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she clung tightly to Ryan's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, now smirking, looked at Brian with a taunting expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia's right. You'll always be trash. Even if you have a little money now, you're still trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you the one talking big about competing with me for the Trillion Group partnership? You probably won't even make the cut. I'm dying to see how you plan to compete with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian flashed a sly grin. "You'll find out soon enough. But just so you know, if you lose, don't come crying to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he wrapped his arm around Anastasia's waist and walked off with a casual swagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian walked away, Ryan's expression soured, his eyes burning with a cold, dangerous gleam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately pulled out his phone and dialed Raven, demanding an explanation for why Brian had yet to be eliminated.</span></p></div>
