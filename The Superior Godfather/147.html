        <h1>Chapter 147 Sorry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole room erupted in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Aria in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had she not spent the two-billion-dollar funds, but she had also reached long-term cooperation with the Trillion Group and won all of their company's engineering projects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, the Trillion Group had transferred five billion dollars to the account of the Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders thought, "But isn't the Trillion Group on the verge of going bankrupt due to a broken capital chain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they have so much money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, both the senior executives and the shareholders were stunned, and overwhelmed by this series of news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner stared at Aria with wide eyes, unable to believe her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, having thought of something, he burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Aria, you're lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone knows that the Trillion Group's capital chain is broken and it's about to go bankrupt. It's impossible for them to transfer five billion dollars to our group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said the Trillion Group transferred five billion dollars to us. Where's the money? Show it to everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders also snapped out of their shock and stared at Aria, waiting for her to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, what Aria had said just now was just one-sided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They needed facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria sneered, "The rumor that the Trillion Group's capital chain is broken and it's about to go bankrupt is just a false one. As for the whereabouts of the five-billion-dollar transfer, why don't you ask the finance department to check our company's account?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Go check it right away!" With Noah's roar, the chief financial officer opened the company's bank account in public and started the query.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the five-billion-dollar transfer in the account was presented in front of everyone, shocking them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There really is five billion dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My god, the Trillion Group really did transfer five billion dollars to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the shareholders led by Noah were excited and couldn't help exclaiming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing was more persuasive than money and facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they completely believed Aria's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner was shocked, his mind went blank, and he couldn't believe that everything was really as Aria had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about his accusations against Aria, Tanner turned pale and felt extremely embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, everyone gradually recovered from their shock and looked at Aria with admiration, apology, and flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins, I'm sorry I wrongly accused you. Please forgive us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins, you're a hero of our company. We will do our best to meet any request you may have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Trillion Group was very important in the real estate industry. With its support, the Queen's Construction Group had an infinite future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked up at Noah and asked, "Any request?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah answered without hesitation, "Of course. As long as we can do it, we will meet your requirements!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria said, "Good, it's a deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's expression was cold as she suddenly pointed at Tanner and said, "I want you to remove him from his position and fire him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria launched a counter-attack against Tanner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's face changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders looked at each other and then directly announced to Tanner, "Tanner, you're fired. Pack your things and get out of here right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Tanner's wife was quite attractive, Noah was almost tired of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Tanner turned pale and sat down on the ground directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had intended to use this opportunity to kick Aria out of the company, but he never expected that it would be himself who was fired in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if thinking of something, he pleaded with Aria, "Ms. Jenkins, I'm sorry. I won't do this again. Please give me a chance..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Aria looked at him coldly and didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner was about to say something more when Noah interrupted him, "You guys, throw him out of here right now!"</span></p></div>
