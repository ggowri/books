        <h1>Chapter 76 The Meeting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Brian woke up at the late hour of ten o'clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne, who had kept him company through the night, had long since left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stretched and prepared to get out of bed, his phone buzzed on the nightstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, do you think it would be alright to meet my cousin at the Beach Hotel?" Sam's respectful voice came through as soon as Brian answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk crept onto Brian's face as he recalled the information Anne had shared with him the night before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll let my cousin know and then I'll swing by to pick you up shortly," Sam replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for that. I'll drive myself," Brian said, dismissing the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he got up to dress and wash up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was about to leave, something on the table caught his eye&mdash;a plane ticket, a business card, and a note.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The note read in Anne's familiar handwriting: [Brian, I booked you a flight to Polandia. I have a friend there who will help you out once you arrive.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm smile spread across Brian's face as he felt a surge of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected her to care so much, even arranging his trip abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, she hadn't quite grasped what he had told her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Didn't I mention that I am the 'Master of the War Deities' Ryan had referred to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuckling to himself, Brian was just about to leave when his phone rang again. It was Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, what's the occasion for the call?" he asked, recognizing her cool, melodic voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, a friend has invited me to meet up. Would you like to join me for lunch?" Anastasia asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought for a moment before replying, "Sorry, Rachael. I already have plans for lunch. How about we reschedule?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, no problem. We can catch up another time," she said, sounding a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good!" Brian replied, nodding as he hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then hopped into his Pagani Huayra and headed straight for the Beach Hotel, eager to see Ryan's reaction when they met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a lavish mansion, Anastasia stared at her phone after ending the call, a hint of frustration crossing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, her cousin Denzel Vaughn, one of the five heirs of the Vaughn family, had tracked her down to Riverwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had arranged to meet her at the Beach Hotel for lunch today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Anastasia had planned to invite Brian along, but to her surprise, he had other commitments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza and Kale, who had been nearby, quickly chimed in, "Ms. Vaughn, did Brian agree to join you for the meeting with Mr. Denzel Vaughn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia shook her head gently, her expression calm. "He can't make it... but that's probably for the best. I don't want him to find out about my identity too soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. It's time to meet Denzel," she said, her tone shifting to one of determination as she gracefully slipped on her heels and made her way out of the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Evans Villa, the atmosphere buzzed with anticipation as Sophia lovingly helped Ryan adjust his tie, ensuring he looked sharp in his suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, when you meet the Master of the War Deities, you need to keep it together. Show some maturity&mdash;don't embarrass Sam, okay?" she instructed, her eyes filled with both concern and affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, make sure you impress the Master. This is crucial for all our futures, you know?" Robert chimed in, while Mary nodded earnestly beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their well-meaning yet serious reminders, Ryan smiled, his confidence steady, "Don't worry, Sophia, Mr. Evans, I've got this under control. You all just stay at home and wait for the good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the weight of the meeting with the Master of the War Deities, Ryan had decided it was best not to bring Sophia and Robert along. He didn't want to risk any displeasure from someone of that caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a person like the Master of the War Deities wasn't someone they could just meet casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, fully prepared and ready to face whatever lay ahead, Ryan bid farewell to his family and drove off towards the Beach Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he drove away, excitement painted the faces of Sophia, Robert, and Mary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that soon they would be soaring high alongside Ryan, riding the waves of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anne stood nearby, a complicated expression on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worry flickered in her eyes as she whispered to herself, "I wonder if Brian has left Riverwood yet..."</span></p></div>
