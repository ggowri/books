        <h1>Chapter 38 Collective Shock</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face showed even more surprise. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan smiled slightly and patted Kevin's shoulder in the front row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It means your contract is completely worthless, right, Kevin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Kevin's face had been treated, it still showed bruising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed Brian with an icy stare, his eyes filled with intense hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. That contract was just something I made up to fool this idiot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face instantly changed, showing panic and bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, you're a vice president. How could you deceive people like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin spat on the ground and replied with contempt, "I screwed you over. What are you gonna do about it, you stupid piece of shit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia felt immense satisfaction watching Brian's panicked expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You thought you could compete with my Ryan for the Trillion Group partnership with your pathetic skills and intelligence? That's laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were you, I'd jump off a bridge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian being ganged up on by everyone, Anastasia frowned in disapproval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone should be jumping off the bridge, it's your lot," she snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all seriously too stupid to see that Brian's just messing with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Messing with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Sophia both froze in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan and Kevin, sitting in the front row, couldn't help but furrow their brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia let out a cold laugh. "You still don't get it? Don't tell me you believe Brian doesn't know Kevin's contract is worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He knows damn well that Kevin is your ace in the hole, yet he still walks in here full of confidence to compete with Ryan for the Trillion Group partnership. Did you think he'd come unprepared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Sophia exchanged dismissive looks, still refusing to take Brian seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What could that loser possibly have up his sleeve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan turned to Kevin with a worried frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bro, there's no way anything could go wrong today, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin rolled his eyes and waved the document folder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The final partnership is already set in stone! It's going to the Carter Group. Just wait for me to go up and announce it. What could go wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, kid," Ryan sneered at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear what Kevin said? Don't tell me you think that contract's talking about your pathetic little startup?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian let out a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if my company's name is there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your company? Kid, what fantasy world are you living in? I sealed this document myself! You think I don't know which company name is written inside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin pulled out his phone and brought up the photos he'd taken of the document before sealing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a good look, Brian. Why don't you see for yourself which company is listed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia pointed at the company name above, her voice dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open those eyes of yours, Brian. It clearly says 'the Carter Group'! Ryan's company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian remained utterly calm. "Yeah, I see it. It does say 'the Carter Group'. Should I congratulate you folks in advance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia and Ryan expected Brian to be shocked and furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, his calm reaction left them feeling like they'd punched a pillow. It was totally unsatisfying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Brian's composure made their blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their reactions, Anastasia couldn't help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's and Ryan's expressions were just too priceless and ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you sneaky devil," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conference officially began as Celeste, wearing a haute couture dress, stepped onto the podium to deliver her speech, which was met with enthusiastic applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes swept across the audience as she continued speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you all know, Trillion Group organized this investment conference to find partners for developing the Weston project, which will become the largest commercial center in the southwest region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty-one companies have cut into multiple selection rounds. These include Mr. Ryan Carter's Carter Group, Ms. Aria Jenkins' Queen's Construction Group... and Mr. Brian Edwards' Transcendent Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'd like to invite our vice president, Mr. Kevin Wright, to announce Trillion Group's final choice of partner. Let's give him a warm welcome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience broke into enthusiastic applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin glanced at Brian coldly before walking to the podium. There, he slowly opened the envelope and took out the document.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the name of the chosen company, his pupils constricted, and his face froze in disbelief. He stood there, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was Brian's Transcendent Construction Group chosen as the final partner?</span></p></div>
