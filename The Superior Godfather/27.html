        <h1>Chapter 27 Good Impression</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but swallow, his gaze lingering on the curve of her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia wasn't wearing any underwear, and from this angle, even the faint outline of her vagina was visible, making him really want to thrust in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it... bad?" Anastasia asked softly, her face flushed as she buried it in the blankets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took a deep breath, trying to refocus. He carefully examined her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were slightly swollen, and there was a bruise near her tailbone, clearly indicating she had taken quite a fall in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've really hurt yourself. There's swelling, and I think your tailbone might be fractured. I'll need to use my energy to reduce the swelling and help set the bone... it might sting a little, but try to hang in there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently placed his hands on her hips, applying his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia flinched slightly at the touch, her cheeks turning even redder as she wished she could vanish into the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he worked, the softness and warmth under his hands were more distracting than he expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was harder than he thought to keep his focus as the energy flowed through his palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he massaged, he could clearly see the soft pink surfaces rubbing together, stirring a strong desire within him, leaving him feeling incredibly restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Anastasia was just as uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each press of Brian's hands, unfamiliar sensations rippled through her body, leaving her desperately trying to hold back the soft sighs that threatened to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But worried that Brian might think her reaction too bold, she clenched her teeth, forcing herself to stay silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she could feel a warmth spreading in places she hadn't expected...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian... can you go a little faster? I'm really uncomfortable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the injury's pretty bad, we'll need to keep massaging for a bit longer. If it hurts too much, just shout out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat from his hands sent a surge through Anastasia, and she could no longer hold back the sensations building inside her. Soft sighs escaped her lips involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... oh... mmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice, naturally captivating, made each sound even more enticing in Brian's ears, pulling at him in ways he couldn't quite explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's breathing grew more labored, her sounds becoming more intense. Brian could hardly bear it, feeling as though he might burst from the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grip tightened, growing more forceful with each movement. In the end, he couldn't resist any longer and roughly pulled her hips apart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, a stream of white liquid emerged, only making Brian's desire to take action stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, we'll stop the treatment for today. After two more sessions tomorrow and the day after, you'll be fully recovered..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he felt himself losing control, Brian managed to finish the treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to contain his overwhelming urge, he quickly muttered something and rushed into the bathroom, turning on the cold water to cool down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, his movement halted when he saw Anastasia's purple lace lingerie set laid aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of her alluring figure flashed in his mind, and without thinking, he reached for the lingerie, lifting it to his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft floral scent mixed with something sweeter, leaving him momentarily dazed as his breathing quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, he couldn't resist wrapping the lace lingerie around the hardness that seemed ready to burst and started masturbating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gentle sensation left him feeling almost weightless, and his thoughts inevitably drifted to Anastasia's captivating figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bedroom, Anastasia lay on the bed, her eyes dazed, her body limp as she struggled to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never been this close to a man before and couldn't handle the kind of massage and stimulation Brian had given her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, it felt like she was floating, as if she had been lifted into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she glanced down, she realized she had wet herself, and the sheets were stained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a wave of both embarrassment and anger. She never thought she would lose control like that and reach orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but think that Brian must have noticed something was wrong, which was why he had left so suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made her feel even more ashamed and frustrated. She wished she could just disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she didn't know how she was supposed to face Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she heard the sound of water running from the bathroom. As she thought about how Brian had hurriedly left, a faint smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he must have been just as uncomfortable as she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone to stay composed in that situation and not take advantage, she had to admit, Brian was quite the gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been any other man, she imagined things might have gone in a very different direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made her think more highly of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, she adjusted her bathrobe, walked to the living room, and dialed Kale's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm at Riverside Villa No. 9. Have Eliza bring me a change of clothes."</span></p></div>
