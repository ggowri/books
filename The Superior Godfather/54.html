        <h1>Chapter 54 Seduction</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Mr. Edwards. We were just following Ms. Jones' orders. We didn't mean to offend you! Please forgive us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, we're really sorry. Please accept our apologies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by David, the security guards quickly apologized to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, however, stood rooted to the spot, her face a mix of embarrassment and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply couldn't bring herself to apologize to Brian in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was convinced that Aria must have been deceived by Brian, which was why she was acting this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were plenty of such cases in society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Karen unaffected, Aria glared at her fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jones, I said apologize to Mr. Edwards. Are you deaf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen hesitated and then steeled herself to say, "Ms. Jenkins, to be honest, Brian and I have known each other for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what your relationship with him is, but let me make one thing clear: he's a good-for-nothing loser. Don't let him fool you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's face darkened, and she slapped Karen's beautiful cheek again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no right to judge Mr. Edwards. I'm ordering you to apologize to him right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen covered her cheek, her face a mix of urgency and resentment. "Ms. Jenkins, I'm just looking out for you. Don't be deceived by his looks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Karen's stubbornness, Aria slapped her a few more times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize! No more excuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face was now swollen, and she finally realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Aria fearfully and then reluctantly muttered to Brian, "I'm sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Karen's clearly reluctant expression, Brian was not pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did your arrogance go? Who are you apologizing to? Speak up. I can't hear you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face was livid, but she had to swallow her pride and force out the words through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I'm sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at her coldly. "How did you treat me before? Do you really think an apology is enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain her anger any longer, Karen glared at Brian furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I've already apologized! What more do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian could respond, Aria cut in coldly, "Karen, watch your tone! Listen carefully. You're fired. Pack up your things and get out now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen froze, her face turning ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had worked hard in the company for years to climb to her current position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was very likely to be promoted to HR manager next year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she was being fired just like that because she had offended Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen couldn't accept or bear such a result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once fired, she would lose all her income.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't be able to repay her huge debts, and the luxury car and villa she had bought on loan would be repossessed by the bank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would lose everything and become homeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, this way, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria glanced at Karen coldly and then led Brian toward the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Ms. Jenkins! Ms. Jenkins! Please give me another chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen snapped back to reality and quickly apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to follow them to plead for mercy but was blocked by Aria's secretary outside the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only watch helplessly as Aria and Brian disappeared into the elevator and out of her sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria led Brian to her office and sat down on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently brushed her bangs aside and asked with a smile, "Mr. Edwards, would you like something to drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought for a moment and said, "Could I have a cup of coffee, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure. Just a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria nodded with a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To show her respect for Brian, she personally made the coffee for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she bent over, her blouse collar dropped slightly, revealing a deep cleavage to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breasts encased in a white lace bra seemed about to burst out of the fabric, incredibly tempting.</span></p></div>
