        <h1>Chapter 53 Karen's Apology</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Karen with a calm expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said I'm here to talk to Aria about a partnership. I'm not here to apply for a job!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen clearly didn't believe a word Brian said. She let out a derisive laugh and looked at him with a teasing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even try to put on airs at a time like this. Do you really think I'll let security throw you out right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian ignored her and took out his phone, calling Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins, I'm downstairs at your company. Someone's blocking my way. Could you come down, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Brian turned to Karen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've called Ms. Jenkins. She'll be right down to meet me. I suggest you don't make trouble for yourself. Go do your job and avoid losing this great position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, it was always Karen who scolded Brian. Now, she was on the receiving end of his reprimand. Karen couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you son of a gun! Do you really think making a phone call is going to scare me? Dream on! I'm going to teach you a lesson today! Where's security? Throw this fraudster out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her command, more than ten security guards, armed with batons, rushed from all directions and surrounded Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some nerve coming to our company to scam us! Guys, beat him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the security captain, David Johnson, was about to move, a cold and authoritative female voice rang out sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden voice startled everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the stunned gazes of the crowd, a tall and elegant woman walked over, accompanied by her secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Aria, the founder of Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good afternoon, Ms. Jenkins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone greeted Aria respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards, led by David, also bowed their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face was filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Why would Ms. Jenkins come down at a time like this? Could it be that she's really here to see Brian? No way! There's no way a loser like Brian could know someone as important as Ms. Jenkins. This has to be a coincidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Karen quickly said, "David, don't just stand there! Get rid of this waste of space right now! Don't let him disturb Ms. Jenkins..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria slapped her across the face, cutting her off mid-sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins," Karen said, covering her cheek in shock and confusion as she looked at Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aria didn't even glance at her. She quickly walked up to Brian and bowed her head in apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards. I've failed to keep my staff in line, and they've disrespected you. Please accept my apologies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was extremely respectful towards Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had won the Trillion Group's project from Ryan and Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His capabilities were undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like him, Aria could only befriend him. She absolutely couldn't afford to offend Brian or become his enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she might end up like Ethan and Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Aria's respectful attitude towards Brian, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist's mouth dropped open in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "He was telling the truth! He really knows Ms. Jenkins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David and the other security guards were frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how they had almost beaten up and thrown out Brian, they felt a chill run down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew how arrogant Aria could be. Even when high-ranking officials visited the company, she hadn't shown them this much respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hadn't been putting on airs in front of her. He had genuinely called Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "He's just a loser! How could he know Aria? Why is she treating him with such respect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Karen's mind was filled with too many questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins, there's no need for such formality. I should have informed you in advance," Brian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria smiled, "Mr. Edwards, rest assured. I will give you a satisfactory resolution for what happened today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Aria coldly scanned Karen and David among others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She barked, "Stop standing there like statues! Apologize to Mr. Edwards right now!"</span></p></div>
