        <h1>Chapter 117 Useless Nobody</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was eight in the evening at the Paradise Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The luxurious banquet hall was packed with Trillion Group's shareholders and executives, creating quite a lively atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas couldn't help but smile at the scene before him. It had been a while since he'd felt this good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Eric beside him and asked in a serious tone, "Is everyone here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone except Damian has arrived, Thomas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' eyes narrowed at this news, a cold glint flashing across them as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Damian is dead set on sticking with that kid Brian till the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric smiled and tried to reassure him, "Thomas, it's Damian's loss if he doesn't show up. After all, getting in with the Vaughn family of Azuriath State isn't as easy as he thinks..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas slightly nodded and said firmly, "In that case, let's get started."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric handed Thomas the microphone after turning it on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm delighted you could attend this arranged private gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beyond just catching up with everyone, I've invited you here because I want us all to make some serious money together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, all eyes turned to Thomas, filled with curiosity and questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly do you mean by making big money together, Mr. Lee?" Zac Clooney, the fourth largest shareholder of Trillion Group, asked with keen interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Thomas could answer, Damian Phillips, the third largest shareholder, walked into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thomas, you plan to make a fortune without me?" Damian called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' face lit up with a smile as he quickly walked over to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damian, I thought you were set on sticking with Brian. Didn't expect to see you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian narrowed his eyes before breaking into a smile. "Come on, Thomas, what are you talking about? Don't tell me you believed I trusted that kid Brian enough to bet everything on him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Thomas could respond, Damian continued, "You don't know this, but I had my people dig into his background. That kid was a complete loser before all this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you think I would count on some clueless nobody to be the chairman of Trillion Group and lead us to success?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Brian had sent him to spy and gather intelligence, Damian knew he had to be convincing to gain Thomas' trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoped Brian wouldn't hold these words against him when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room was shocked and surprised by Damian's revelations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them expected their new chairman to have such a disgraceful past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas wore a broad smile as he patted Damian's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damian, I knew I could count on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Thomas turned to address the stunned crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Phillips was right earlier! Our company's new chairman is indeed worthless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He started as a bodyguard for CEO Sophia at the Evans Group. He managed to worm his way into her life and marry her, becoming the live-in husband of the Evans family. Later, he took several bullets while protecting Sophia and became disabled. Eventually, she betrayed and abandoned him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, for some crazy reason, Mr. Reynolds gave him shares in the Trillion Group for free and made him chairman...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have all of Brian's background information right here. Feel free to look at it yourselves if you don't believe me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned on the projector he had prepared and displayed Brian's information for everyone to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was shocked and bewildered when they saw Brian's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they first met Brian at the shareholders' meeting, they thought he was talented and exceptional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined his background could be so humble and lowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Damian was surprised. Though he had investigated Brian, his intel wasn't nearly as detailed as Thomas'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was satisfied with everyone's reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Do you think this lucky nobody from the bottom of society can lead Trillion Group to greater heights and glory?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell you honestly that he can't. He's not capable. He doesn't have what it takes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore... I'm pulling my investment from Trillion Group!"</span></p></div>
