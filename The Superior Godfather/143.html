        <h1>Chapter 143 Surprise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, Ted knelt in front of Brian and begged, "Mr. Edwards, I know I was wrong. Please give me another chance to cooperate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be good if Trillion Group really went bankrupt. After all, Ted had received the money and would suffer no losses. However, he was shocked to find that Trillion Group would not go bankrupt at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trillion Group could bring a staggering amount of capital flow and business volume to the bank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the back lost the cooperation with Trillion Group, it would be a huge loss and cause a series of reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the leaders found out about this, Ted would be removed from his position or even fired and blacklisted by the industry. It could be said that his future would be ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted was filled with fear, and his gaze towards Brian was full of pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galen also knelt in front of Brian and said, "Mr. Edwards, it was my fault for being stupid and believing the rumors. Please give me another chance. From now on, for all the Trillion Group's projects, I'm willing to undertake the construction at a price 50% lower than the market price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galen didn't want to be held accountable by Trillion Group in the future, face legal judgment, and even suffer imprisonment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had an indifferent expression and said coldly, "No need. In the future, all the Trillion Group's construction projects will be constructed by Queen's Construction Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, everyone was shocked. Their gazes toward Aria were full of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that Aria's "stupid and risky" behavior would bring her such a generous reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trillion Group, as the leading enterprise in the real estate industry of Azuriath State, had countless businesses, and its construction projects were spread all over the state. Any single project contained huge profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian handed over all the construction projects to Queen's Construction Group. It was simply like a sudden windfall from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Trillion Group didn't collapse, Queen's Construction Group would never lack business and cooperation opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the support of Trillion Group, Queen's Construction Group would soon surpass Hastings Construction Group and become a leading enterprise in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People could already envision the rise of Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria and her secretary were extremely shocked upon hearing this. The secretary, who widened her eyes, was so shocked that she couldn't even utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the secretary's opinion, it was a stupid and risky decision for Aria to support Trillion Group, which was on the verge of bankruptcy, regardless of the risk of embezzling company funds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she never expected that there was no problem with Trillion Group's funds, and Trillion Group wouldn't go bankrupt either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Brian even announced that all the future construction projects of Trillion Group would be handed over to Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary turned to look at Aria with intense enthusiasm and admiration in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary praised, "Amazing, Ms. Jenkins! Tanner and the others will definitely have a wonderful reaction when they hear this news after we get back to the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted, Galen, and the others were about to say something but were interrupted by Brian, "Farrah, show them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people were panicked, and they quickly begged, "Mr. Edwards, we were wrong. Please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of impatience flashed across Brian's cold eyes. "Do you want to end up like Dyer and then be thrown out of here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted, Galen, and the others had bitter expressions and could only leave reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, Brian turned to look at Aria. "Ms. Jenkins, I've already had someone transfer the subsequent project payment for the project in Weston to your company's account. It's a total of five billion dollars. Remember to check it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Brian handed the bank card Aria had just given him back to her and said solemnly, "When all the partners were terminating the cooperation with my company and demanding the payment, you stood up and helped me without hesitation. I'm really touched. Thank you for your kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria felt a bit embarrassed. "Mr. Edwards, I didn't help much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled and handed an agreement to Aria. "Your kindness is more valuable than anything else. This is the long-term cooperation agreement between Trillion Group and Queen's Construction Group. If you have no objections, please sign it. From now on, your company will be the designated partner of Trillion Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... Thank you so much for your favor, Mr. Edwards!" Aria was overjoyed and flattered. She picked up the pen and signed the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this agreement and the five billion dollars that Brian just transferred, Aria's position in Queen's Construction Group would be greatly enhanced and unshakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked at Brian, her beautiful eyes full of anticipation. "Mr. Edwards, to express my gratitude, may I have the honor to invite you to dinner?"</span></p></div>
