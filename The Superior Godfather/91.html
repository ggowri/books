        <h1>Chapter 91 Breaking a Promise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bank card shot through the air like a hidden weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan calmly swirled his wine glass, a flicker of amusement crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tattooed, bald man standing behind him took a step forward, his presence filling the room. Without missing a beat, he reached out and grabbed the card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the card's powerful force sent him stumbling backward, his feet skidding several paces before he finally steadied himself. His hand trembled slightly as he held onto the card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, didn't expect you're something," Dylan said with a sly smile, eyeing Brian with a hint of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though... if there's not much money on that card, things might get ugly for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check if it has 86 million on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man nodded and swiped the card through the POS machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp sound of a successful transaction rang through the room as 86 million was transferred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan smirked, tossing the card back at Brian and turning his attention to Karen, clearly intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jones, I didn't think you'd find someone willing to pay your debts for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the debt cleared, Karen finally let out a sigh of relief. Her eyes, though, were full of mixed emotions as she looked at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she owed him yet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, however, simply stared at Dylan with a cold, detached expression. "The debt's settled. Can we go now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go?" Dylan grinned, looking at Brian like he was some kind of joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tilted his head slightly and turned his attention to Karen with a lecherous gleam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can leave, but she stays."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit like a slap to the face. Brian's expression darkened, his anger rising in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reed, what is this supposed to mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan took a leisurely puff of his cigar, unfazed by the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, really... just want to have a little fun with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're worried, feel free to wait outside. Once I'm done, I'll let her go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face turned red with fury, her gaze burning with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reed, you're supposed to be someone with status in Riverwood, but here you are, breaking your word and acting without any shame..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Dylan had no intention of letting her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes turned icy, a dangerous edge flashing in his stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan just shrugged, unconcerned. "Come on, don't overreact. It's just a bit of fun. I'm not going to hurt you, and I never said I wouldn't let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Karen could reply, he leaned in with a predatory smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, Ms. Jones, I've never met a woman as mature and sexy as you. You've got this vibe that's got me hooked. I've wanted you for a while now, but the timing was never right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I bumped up your interest rate, hoping you wouldn't be able to pay and I'd get to have my way with you. But then this guy shows up and pays off the debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, if I just let you walk away like this... I won't be satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face turned to ice as she realized just how despicable Dylan really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care. The debt is paid, and we're done here. Let's go, Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to pull him away, but the two bodyguards at the door moved in and blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression darkened further, his eyes colder than ever as he locked his gaze on Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reed, you really want to make this difficult?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dylan didn't even seem to acknowledge him as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do things my way. Got a problem with that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't like it, come at me. I'm not scared of you, idiot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around Brian grew heavy with tension. His energy surged, and in a blur, he struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards didn't even have time to react before they were taken down. Brian's leg hit them with such force that their necks snapped instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cracking his knuckles, Brian stepped forward, his presence overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First time anyone's asked me for this, huh? If you want a fight, I'll gladly give it to you."</span></p></div>
