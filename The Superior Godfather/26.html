        <h1>Chapter 26 We're Not Married Yet</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't just stand there... help me up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping out of his daze, Brian quickly stepped forward, offering her his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Anastasia gasped as she struggled to rise, the pain in her ankle flaring up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand pressed the bathrobe tightly against her chest, but it slipped slightly as she tried to steady herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lost her balance again, and just as she was about to fall, Brian reacted instinctively. He caught her, pulling her close into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathrobe slipped entirely, and their bodies were pressed together, her soft warmth against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's heart skipped a beat. He could feel her breath, warm and quick, against his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's face flushed, and she was acutely aware of the strength of his body, his presence overwhelming in the confined space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around them seemed charged, filled with a sudden, undeniable tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood like that for a moment, their breaths shallow and quick. The room seemed to fade away; the only thing that mattered now was the closeness between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a heartbeat, everything seemed suspended, and then, driven by an impulse he couldn't resist, Brian leaned in. His lips brushed against hers in a soft, tentative kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft shiver ran through Anastasia's body, and she let out a low, enticing sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to pull away, but Brian's tongue gently parted her lips, deepening the kiss as they shared a passionate, heated exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation hit Anastasia like a wave, her body going weak as she melted into Brian's arms, instinctively responding to his eager, hungry kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft, sweet lips were like a drug to him, and he couldn't help but savor every moment, drinking in the warmth and sweetness that lingered between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands moved of their own accord, tracing over her body, drawn to the softness of her curves. He finally cupped her chest, the sensation of her warmth making him lose himself in the moment, his touch growing more insistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm... ah... oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each breath, each whisper, seemed to pull her deeper into the shared moment, her body responding to his touch, caught up in the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down at her firm tits, Brian couldn't hold back anymore and took them in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... no..." Anastasia gasped, suddenly snapping out of the moment. She quickly pushed Brian away, her breath coming in shallow pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not married yet... this isn't right," she said, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been someone who wanted to save everything for her wedding night, and right now, Brian clearly hadn't yet earned that level of trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, realizing his impulsive actions, pulled back, regret flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stole one last glance at her, her beauty taking his breath away. Quickly, he grabbed the robe from the floor and draped it over her, his voice apologetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry... you're just so beautiful, and I couldn't control myself...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me get you to bed so you can rest, and I'll take care of your injury."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could respond, Brian carefully lifted her, carrying her to the bedroom and gently laying her down on the soft bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's cheeks flushed with embarrassment, and she instinctively pulled the robe tighter around herself, trying to cover up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it your ankle?" Brian asked, concern in his voice as he looked at her swollen foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded, glancing down at her swollen right ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian reached out, gently holding her foot as he inspected it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," he said reassuringly. "It's just a dislocation. I'll use my energy to reduce the swelling, then we'll get it back in place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words sank in, a cool, soothing sensation began to spread from his palm, easing the pain and quickly reducing the swelling in her ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia couldn't help but stare in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't realized that Brian's energy had healing properties. That explained why his injuries were healing so rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, Brian withdrew his energy, holding her foot gently as he spoke, "I'm going to realign the bone now. It might hurt for a second, but bear with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He applied pressure, and with a soft pop, her ankle was back in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia moved her foot experimentally, amazed to find that the pain was gone entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to sigh in relief, a sharp discomfort in her lower back caused her to wince. "Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's brow furrowed with concern. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia hesitated, her face turning even redder. "When I fell, I... hurt my back, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes widened in understanding, then softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll help with that, too. Just lie on your stomach, and I'll take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia couldn't help but feel a mix of embarrassment and frustration as she thought about the injury, but the searing pain was too much for her to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a reluctant nod, she turned her face even redder and lay down on the bed, shyly adjusting her bathrobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, her curvy, well-shaped backside slowly came into Brian's view...</span></p></div>
