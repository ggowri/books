        <h1>Chapter 25 Do They Look Good?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, did you ever train as a chef?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These dishes you made are incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Anastasia a moment to recover, her eyes dreamy as she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Brian to be such an extraordinary cook. His skills were on a level that even top-tier chefs couldn't compare to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I picked up a few things in my free time," Brian said with a smile, casual as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew that, aside from being the founder of the War Deities, Brian was also the only heir to a legendary culinary tradition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just some casual learning, and you're this good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was stunned. She couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed, recalling how greedily she'd devoured his food just moments earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't respond right away. His gaze drifted, watching Anastasia, whose skin glistened slightly with sweat, her figure gently lit by the room's soft glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing his attention, Anastasia gave a playful smile, her lips curving just enough to tease him. "Do they look good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's breath caught for a moment, his throat tightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly shifted his focus, trying to regain composure. "You're covered in sweat. You should probably take a shower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Anastasia agreed with a smile, heading toward the bathroom. She left him with one last glance over her shoulder, a playful sway to her steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, the sound of running water echoed from the bathroom, and the air grew thick with mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the glass of the door, Brian caught a glimpse of Anastasia, her seductive figure under the warm stream of water. The gentle flow traced down her neck, over her full breasts, and along her slim waist, before disappearing into the shadows below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was irresistible, an undeniable temptation. His energy surged, and his mind raced with images of taking her, pinning her beneath him, and claiming her with fierce passion...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, he made a silent vow that he would conquer this proud, distant woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, could you bring me a bathrobe? My dress is soaked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I'll get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded, opening the closet to grab a white bathrobe and hurrying back to the bathroom door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got it here. Can you open the door for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just pass it through the crack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door creaked open a little, and Anastasia's hand appeared, reaching out for the robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was mostly hidden behind the door, Brian couldn't help but notice her reflection in the nearby mirror, her naked body, laid bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was every bit the embodiment of a high-fashion model. Her breasts, full and perfectly rounded, were a striking sight, sitting proudly without a hint of sag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft pink of her nipples, almost like ripe fruit, stirred thoughts that were difficult to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hips, full and high, created an intoxicating curve that seamlessly blended with her impossibly slim waist. Her long, toned legs, paired with that cold, aloof elegance, made her look like an exquisite piece of art, one that left Brian momentarily breathless, caught in the mesmerizing pull of her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, hurry and pass me the bathrobe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only when Anastasia's voice reached him that Brian snapped back to reality, quickly handing her the robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door shut, he reluctantly tore his gaze away, still lost in the lingering image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp cry came from the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floor, still slick from the shower, caused Anastasia to lose her footing, and she crashed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain that shot through her ankle and hips made her wince, her breath catching sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, what happened? Are you okay? Can you move?" Brian called out, panic in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm fine. Just slipped." Anastasia struggled to sit up, but the pain in her ankle and hips kept her from finding any strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she gave in and called for help. "Brian, my ankle... I can't get up. The door's not locked... Can you come in and help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to come in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt a rush of excitement and quickly swallowed, pushing the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Anastasia sat on the floor, her face twisted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still not fully dressed in the bathrobe, she held it across her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it barely covered her, her flawless body almost on display for him. The sight left Brian breathless, his heart racing.</span></p></div>
