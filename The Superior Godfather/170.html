        <h1>Chapter 170 Teasing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, downtown, at a roadside food stall</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian and Karen were sitting at a </span><span>t</span><span>able, munching on skewers and sipping beer under the glow of flickering neon lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you gonna tell me why someone tried to kidnap you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen let out a bitter laugh</span><span>. </span><span>Her stunning face flashed with helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly? I have no idea. I've been </span><span>busy taking</span><span> job interviews all week. I'd just </span><span>finished</span><span> the last one and was on my way home</span><span>, </span><span>then boom&mdash;a bunch of guys jumped out of nowhere and shoved me into a van...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't shown up when you did</span><span>,</span><span> I might've</span><span>..</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Anyway,</span><span> Brian</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>hank you. </span><span>Really. </span><span>For saving me again. This one's </span><span>for you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian chuckled, </span><span>clinking his glass</span><span> lightly against hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't </span><span>worry</span><span>. I'll have someone look into those guys</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>See who sent them</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then his gaze drifted over her, lingering with clear interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know. I did just save your life. How do you plan on thanking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had only been a few days since they last saw each other, but she seemed more refined, more composed, </span><span>and </span><span>beautiful</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a crisp white blouse tucked into a sleek black pencil skirt, her figure was accentuated by a tailored blazer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore sheer stockings and high heels that clicked faintly on the pavement when she walked. The whole ensemble exuded sharp professionalism</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words brought a warm flush to her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind</span><span> </span><span>drifted back to that night</span><span> when</span><span> she had gone to Brian for</span><span> </span><span>help&mdash;tangled limbs, the raw intensity that had left her trembling. Her body remembered him vividly. Too vividly.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That overwhelming rush of sensation had left a mark she couldn't quite erase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, from somewhere deep within, that same longing began to stir, an ache for his touch, for the way he had once held her like nothing else in the world mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed it down and forced a smile as she met his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... how exactly</span><span> do you want me</span><span> to thank you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand slipped under the table, resting casually on her thigh, over the smooth nylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his hand brushed her thigh, Karen's cheeks flushed. She bit down gently on her lip, torn between pulling away and giving in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His touch sent a jolt through her, sharp and irresistible, and her body trembled before she could stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian's hand moved toward her skirt, Karen quickly caught his wrist, her gaze pleading. "Not here... there are too many people. Let's... go somewhere else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brian wasn't about to stop. He pulled his hand free and, with a slow, deliberate motion, slipped under her skirt</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>H</span><span>is fingers brush</span><span>ed</span><span> against the delicate fabric of her stockings and underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was unlike anything she had felt before</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Her</span><span> eyes narrow</span><span>ed</span><span> with a deep, heated gaze. She pressed</span><span> </span><span>her hand against her mouth, trying</span><span> not to make</span><span> any sound, while her eyes darted nervously around. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire body was on edge, every muscle taut with the fear of being caught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more she tried to keep control, the sharper her senses became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat and pressure made her breath quicken, her skin flush, and her body tremble with increasing intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warmth gathered, and despite the layers between them, Brian </span><span>felt it too</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gasp escaped her lips before she could stop it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few people nearby turned toward them, </span><span>confused</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned crimson, and she quickly pointed at the food to cover her awkwardness. "Oh... this grilled meat... it's really spicy, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner</span><span> looked</span><span> puzzled</span><span> and</span><span> shrugged. "But Miss, you ordered this with just pepper. It shouldn't be that spicy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's cheeks burned even more, and she wished she could vanish on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She explain</span><span>ed</span><span> quickly, "I... I just meant the pepper. It's a bit too much... I'm allergic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around her seemed to understand</span><span> and turned back</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the owner looked at the dish, still uncertain. "But... I didn't put that much pepper in it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her frustration mounted, and she slammed the fork down onto the table. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure? Look closely. There's pepper everywhere!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, let's go," she muttered</span><span>. She</span><span> le</span><span>ft</span><span> the money</span><span> on the table</span><span> and </span><span>was </span><span>practically dragging him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is so embarrassing. What a disaster</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This was all his fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they tried to leave, a group of drunk middle-aged men stepped into their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were local thugs.</span><span> They were eating nearby, but</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>he moment they heard Karen's groan, they were immediately drawn to her striking beauty and </span><span>sexy</span><span> figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they leered at her, their eyes filled with unmasked desire and greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, gorgeous. You'</span><span>re a real tease, huh?</span><span> How about joining us for a little fun?"</span></p></div>
