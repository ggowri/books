        <h1>Chapter 33 Ethan's Triumph</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a VIP room at Riverwood City Hospital, Kevin lay in bed with bandages wrapped around his face, wincing in pain as he received his IV drip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan Carter rushed to visit when he heard the news, bringing his son Ryan and Sophia along with gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked when they saw Kevin's terrible condition, and Ryan spoke up with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, who did this to you? Tell me who it was, and I'll make them pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's face turned cold as his eyes filled with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was that little bastard Brian Edwards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian Edwards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Ryan and Sophia exchanged shocked and bewildered looks at hearing this name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan and Kevin furrowed their brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? You guys know this bastard?" Ethan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Kevin... to be honest, Brian is Sophia's good-for-nothing ex-husband," Ryan hesitated before explaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The guy used to be a Meta, but after he lost his energy, he became useless, and Sophia dumped him. Somehow, he got his energy back, and now he's trying everything to get revenge on us. He even threatened to compete with me for the Trillion Group partnership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that why he came looking for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin nodded slowly, his face darkening as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he started a company called Transcendent Construction Group. Celeste brought him to me, hoping to partner with Trillion Group. When I refused, he got physical...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would've killed that son of a bitch if that bitch Celeste hadn't stopped me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Sophia were both shocked by this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, are you saying that bastard Brian knows your company president, Celeste, and they're close?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin nodded. "Yes. If I'm not mistaken, that guy is just Celeste's boy toy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Ethan's and Sophia's faces darkened at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that a nobody like Brian would hook up with Celeste, the CEO of the Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were true, wouldn't he have a shot at competing with them for the Trillion Group partnership?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan asked, grimly, "Kevin, since that guy knows Celeste, could this affect our deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their serious faces, Kevin just laughed it off, saying casually, "Don't worry about a thing. I've already got over half of the company's executives backing the Carter Group. Even with Celeste's support, he doesn't stand a chance against you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I even signed a fake agreement to throw him off guard. I bet he's out celebrating right now. But the truth is, Trillion Group's real partner would never be him. It's always been the Carter Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Sophia both let out long sighs of relief at this response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan hesitated before asking, "Kevin, are you sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, don't you remember? My uncle is Trillion Group's second-largest shareholder, and he's already given this his blessing. Even Celeste can't override this decision. Unless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless Brian somehow knows our group's new chairman and gets them involved! But seriously, what are the chances of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's eyes flashed with mockery. "The new chairman is quite mysterious. We have never seen them, let alone know their identity or name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, if that punk knew the new chairman, why would he need to come to me for help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just relax and wait for tomorrow's conference. I guarantee the Carter Group will be the star of the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words put Ethan, Ryan, and Sophia at ease, eliminating all their concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Ryan quickly spoke up, "Kevin, get some rest. We'll get out of your hair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry! Once the conference is over, I'll kill that bastard Brian myself. I'll chop him into pieces and feed him to the dogs to avenge you!"</span></p></div>
