        <h1>Chapter 12 A Moment of Stunned Silence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Shadow Fang were all left dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time they had ever seen Zoe lower herself like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, even when dealing with government officials or the mayor of Riverwood, Zoe had always remained composed, showing only the bare minimum of politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, her actions had completely caught them off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the usually composed Anastasia was stunned and taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she had learned from Brian earlier that he knew Zoe, she hadn't expected Zoe to treat Brian with such deep respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the fact that Zoe had called him "Master".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia didn't fully understand what that title meant, but it was clear it implied a unique and highly respected position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's deference to Brian made it obvious that this wasn't just a casual acquaintance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anastasia suddenly realized how little she truly knew about her fianc&eacute;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of curiosity about this man began to well up within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, how many secrets are you hiding?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Zoe, feeling a bit exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He helplessly reached out, pulling Zoe back to her feet, and with a mock scold, he said, "You... didn't I tell you before? I like to keep a low profile. I don't like all these formalities. You're really giving me a headache."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Brian's familiar words, Zoe couldn't help but let out a small, amused laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in front of the astonished onlookers, she opened her arms wide and pulled Brian into a tight embrace, burying his face into her ample chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I've missed you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was immediately surrounded by softness. His face was smushed between her breasts, and it became incredibly hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This woman... is as crazy as ever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go. I can't breathe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Brian's voice broke through that Zoe realized her mistake. She quickly released him, stepping back with a guilty look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gasped for air, greedily inhaling the fresh oxygen, then shot Zoe a look of displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be kidding me... It's been years, and you're still the same. Can't you change?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I didn't mean to. Are you okay? Are you breathing alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's face flushed as she reached out, gently rubbing his chest, trying to help him calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian glared at her, still catching his breath, and grumbled, "I nearly suffocated! Do you think I'm okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, I was just so happy to see you! I'm so sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe blushed deeply, her eyes downcast as she nervously fiddled with her fingers like a little girl who had just been scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shy, sheepish demeanor was so out of character that it left everyone in Shadow Fang completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Zoe had always been cold and domineering in front of them, ready to kill anyone at the slightest provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia raised her brows, noticing the subtle tension between Brian and Zoe. She felt a sudden, unfamiliar unease welling up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was supposed to be Brian's fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to get angry, she realized she had kept her own identity hidden from Brian, and she quickly forced herself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief exchange with Brian, Zoe turned her cold gaze toward Raven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you standing there for? Hurry up and apologize to Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven snapped out of his daze and rushed toward Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frantically began apologizing while repeatedly slapping himself across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, this was all Ryan's doing. He paid me two million to kill you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had known you knew Ms. Guzman, I never would've dared disrespect you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I really know I was wrong. Please, forgive me..."</span></p></div>
