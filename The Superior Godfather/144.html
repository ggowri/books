        <h1>Chapter 144 Regret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still have work to do. I'm sorry," Brian politely declined Aria's invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Mr. Edwards. See you next time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria nodded with a smile, showing her understanding. After chatting with Brian for a while, she left with her secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, given the current situation of the Trillion Group, Brian had a lot to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing Aria off, Brian turned to Celeste and asked, "Celeste, how are those three beauty products I asked you to develop?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian next to them asked in confusion, "What beauty products? Why don't I know about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled, "This series of products has been completed and has passed experimental testing. The effect is incredible. I'm sure that once it's launched, it will sell out instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, do you need to inspect it in person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian shook his head and said, "No need. I trust you. Prepare for full-scale production. The promotion and publicity of this series of products can make good use of the recent public opinion about our company to hype."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, don't worry. I know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste hesitated and then said, "But we haven't come up with a name for the series of products yet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled, picked up a pen, and wrote a stunning name on the paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The EnerGlow Series? This name is amazing. It suits the characteristics of the products!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the product name written by Brian, Celeste was impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This name perfectly matched the characteristics of the three products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women would find it hard to resist when they saw this name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste wanted to tell Brian the promotion and publicity plan for this series of products but was interrupted by Brian, "Handle these on your own. I'm leaving now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Celeste to respond, Brian left with Zoe and Sam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Brian left, Damian finally couldn't help asking Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawthorne, what are the three products you just mentioned to Mr. Edwards? Why don't I know anything about them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste said, "There are a lot of things you don't know. This is a plan and task that Mr. Edwards assigned to me a long time ago. You'll know about this series of products. Just wait for the year-end bonus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and continued, "Mr. Phillips, our company is in urgent need of manpower right now. Please pay attention to the recruitment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Ted, Galen, and the others walked out of the Trillion Group, they were surrounded by reporters who had been waiting at the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Weber, Mr. Hastings, Brian just boasted that he would solve all the debt problems. Has the Trillion Group settled the debts owed to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Weber, Mr. Hastings, did you get the money from the Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted and Galen showed helpless expressions and said in a low voice, "We got the money. The funds owed to us by the Trillion Group have all been settled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporters looked puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you got the money, you should be happy. But why do you look gloomy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did they threaten you to say this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ted and Galen were even more helpless and more upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards and the others didn't threaten us. The Trillion Group did settle all our debts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, Ted and Galen took out their phones and showed the receipt information to the reporters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason we're not happy is that we believed the rumors that the Trillion Group's capital chain was broken and it was about to go bankrupt. Therefore, we terminated all cooperation with the Trillion Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the fact is that the Trillion Group's capital chain was not broken at all, and it's not going to go bankrupt. We can never find such a good partner again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted, Galen, and the others smiled self-deprecatingly and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terminating the cooperation with the Trillion Group was the most wrong decision they had ever made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at their departing backs and thinking about what they said, the reporters were all left stunned.</span></p></div>
