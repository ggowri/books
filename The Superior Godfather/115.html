        <h1>Chapter 115 Breaking Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I apologize to them?" Patrick protested with defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor chimed in. "Mr. Smith, this Brian is just worthless trash from the bottom of society, a broke loser... And that woman's just a college student looking for a sugar daddy. Why should we apologize to people like them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, Dad. If anyone should apologize, it should be them apologizing to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their complete lack of judgment, Paul was livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped Eleanor hard across the face and kicked Patrick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worthless trash from the bottom of society? A broke loser?" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Ms. Hawthorne is looking for a sugar daddy? Which idiot filled your heads with this nonsense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Paul pulled off his belt and lashed out at Eleanor and Patrick, leaving welts on their skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, you stupid fools! Mr. Edwards is a partner at the Trillion Group, and Ms. Hawthorne is the current CEO of Trillion Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit Patrick and Eleanor like lightning bolts, and they stared at Brian and Celeste in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Brian is a partner at Trillion Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That woman is the CEO of Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia's eyes went wide at this moment, shock spreading across her heavily made-up face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she finally understood why Paul had hit her and gotten so angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two people were completely out of their league to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Patrick and Eleanor frozen in place, she shouted sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two idiots, what are you standing there for? Get on your knees and apologize to Mr. Edwards and Ms. Hawthorne right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she was the first to drop to her knees in front of Brian and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne... this is all our fault. We failed to teach them proper manners, which led to this misunderstanding. I sincerely apologize to both of you and hope you can forgive our offensive and ignorant behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she knocked her head against the ground three times in a deep bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Patrick, who was dense, could tell he had messed with the wrong people today, so he quickly apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne, I'm so sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's face was bitter with regret. Though it was hard for her to accept the reality, she still knelt before Brian and forced out the words through her humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne, I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, let's go," Brian said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave them one last icy glance before turning to leave with Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were nothing but ants to him, and they were not worth wasting any more time on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's heart grew more bitter at being ignored by Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, she had seen Brian as nothing but a worthless loser, a poor devil she could bully and push around at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined this bastard would transform into a partner at the Trillion Group after divorcing Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dramatic change in status was beyond her comprehension and acceptance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Olivia breathed a sigh of relief when they saw that Brian and Celeste had not pursued the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They then turned their attention to Patrick, shouting, "You good-for-nothing! Do you realize you almost got our entire Smith family killed today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell us what happened. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick hesitated before speaking quietly, "I... I don't know what happened. Eleanor said they bullied her, so I wanted to help her get revenge, and then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Olivia's eyes flashed coldly as they turned to look at Eleanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Eleanor was about to speak, the manager of the Balenciaga store walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Smith, here's what happened. Mr. Edwards was shopping here with Ms. Hawthorne when Eleanor deliberately came over to harass and provoke them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face darkened as he demanded, "Is this true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Smith, I... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Eleanor could finish her sentence, Olivia cut her off with a sharp slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You clueless idiot! You almost got our whole Smith family killed... Son, you know how to deal with stupid women like this, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick was shocked that Eleanor had started this whole mess. His face darkened with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eleanor, we're done!" Patrick cut her off before she could explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always thought Eleanor was a kind and gentle woman, but now he saw her true colors - a bully who stirred up trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she had nearly caused the complete downfall of the Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping a woman like this by his side would only hold him back.</span></p></div>
