        <h1>Chapter 149 Kiss</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia had never even held a man's hand before, and she couldn't bear such stimulation. She felt her body go limp and let out a seductive moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sound excited Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could no longer hold back his desire. He stuck out his tongue and moved it around in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unprecedented stimulation made Anastasia let out a muffled moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt powerless and subconsciously reached out to hold Brian's neck to prevent herself from falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the strong masculine scent of Brian made her heart race and her body go even more limp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took the opportunity to wrap his right arm around her waist and pulled her into his embrace. He used his left hand to gently squeeze her breasts through her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation of being touched made Anastasia let out a satisfied and enjoyable moan. She instinctively moved her body to respond to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling her response, Brian became even bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no longer satisfied with touching her body through her clothes. Instead, he reached into Anastasia's neckline and grabbed her round and elastic breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was surprised that Anastasia's breasts were so big that he couldn't hold them with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his palm moved, he felt an unprecedented touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were soft, smooth, and elastic. Brian was lost in the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes were hazy, her face flushed, and she breathed heavily under his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful face combined with her current intoxicated expression made Brian excited. He kissed her sexy lips again, holding her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Brian held her perfect breasts with both hands and squeezed them, enjoying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to take it further, Anastasia's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden ringing of the mobile phone startled them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia came to her senses from that mysterious and delightful feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing her impropriety just now, she quickly broke free from Brian's embrace, adjusted her clothes, and picked up the phone, answering it with a feigned calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliza, what's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vaughn, the Anastasia Group has been targeted. The company's network has broken down, the group's stock price is plummeting, and stocks are being sold off in large numbers...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In just half a day, our group's market value has evaporated by tens of billions of dollars. Mr. Vaughn has already used funds to shore up the market, but the downward trend still can't be halted..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Eliza's report, Anastasia exclaimed, "What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me. I'll rush back right away to find a way to deal with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hanging up the phone, Anastasia left in a hurry without even speaking to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Brian had seen Anastasia so flustered and out of sorts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, he took out his phone and dialed Zoe's number, asking her to conduct an investigation immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was highly efficient and soon gave a reply, "Mr. Edwards, not long ago, Ms. Vaughn transferred tens of billions of dollars from the Anastasia Group to assist you, which led to a shortage of funds in her company...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After Denzel got wind of this news, he utilized his connections and influence to suppress and target Ms. Vaughn's company, causing the stock price of the Anastasia Group to drop sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, people are frantically selling the stocks of the Anastasia Group, causing the stock price to keep declining. If no other capital steps in, the entire stock price of the Anastasia Group may return to its level ten years ago overnight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Zoe's report, Brian looked cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hadn't yet punished Denzel for sending assassins to kill him and attempting to bring down the Trillion Group. To his surprise, Denzel had now set his sights on Anastasia's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian wasn't one to be bullied. With a cold expression, he exuded a murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Zoe, who was far away from him, could sense Brian's intense anger and the will to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Inform Velmara to bring back the stock price of the Anastasia Group at all costs and launch a full-scale attack on Denzel's company until it collapses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wants to bring down both me and Anastasia. Then I'll take him on!"</span></p></div>
