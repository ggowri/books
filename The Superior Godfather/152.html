        <h1>Chapter 152 The Man Behind the Scenes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm... yeah... Oh god, you're amazing, Mr. Denzel Vaughn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the luxurious office, the beautiful secretary was bent over against the floor-to-ceiling windows, hips raised, taking Denzel's fierce, relentless thrusts. Her breathy moans filled the space, full of satisfaction. She was so lost in the moment, she didn't even notice the small red light blinking on the camera atop the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But while she was putting on quite the show, Denzel's mind had drifted elsewhere. He couldn't stop picturing his cousin Anastasia's stunning face and sexy figure. Even now, he was moaning her name under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd wanted Anastasia for years. In his mind, he'd played out the fantasy of having her beneath him more times than he could count.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And finally, after waiting so long, the chance had come. The moment Denzel had dreamed of&mdash;breaking her down, forcing her to cave, to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's only a matter of time before Anastasia calls me, begging for mercy. And when she does, I'll make sure she puts that body of hers to good use and serves me right at my feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that delicious thought in his head, Denzel gave the secretary's round ass a firm slap, signaling her to switch positions. She picked up on it instantly and obediently leaned over the desk, her chest pressing into the surface, those full breasts spilling out and flattening against the wood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh," she gasped, her voice trembling with pleasure as Denzel grabbed her hips and thrust back inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was gearing up for another wild round, something on the computer monitor caught his eye. He looked over and his eyes instantly widened in shock, disbelief washing over his face. The Anastasia Group's stock wasn't falling anymore. It had started to rebound and was now skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wh&ndash;What?" Denzel muttered, blinking at the screen. "How is this even possible? The Anastasia Group's stock is skyrocketing right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, losing all composure as he barked toward the door, "Victor! Get your ass in here, now! What's going on? Didn't I tell you to double down on hitting them? Why the hell is Anastasia Group's stock skyrocketing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor rushed in, eyes full of fear as he looked at Denzel and stammered, "Mr. Denzel Vaughn, I did increase pressure on our side, but... I don't know how, there's been a sudden wave of foreign capital flooding into Anastasia Group. It's pushing their price up like crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We did everything we could. We even used the entire round of funding Thomas and the others had secured, but it barely made a dent. Their side has way too much firepower, easily in the hundreds of billions of dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's face twisted with fury. He slammed a fist onto the desk. "Hundreds of billions of dollars? From overseas? Goddammit, why the hell didn't you say anything earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor cast a quick look at the naked secretary still pressed up against Denzel and muttered, "I... I didn't dare disturb you, Mr. Denzel Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's jaw clenched, his eyes locked on the chaotic stock chart. His entire expression darkened. He had no idea where this sudden foreign intervention had come from or why they were bailing Anastasia out now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't tell me Anastasia has connections with some overseas financial big shot. But that's impossible. Someone like her shouldn't even be in the same orbit as those people. Then what the hell is happening right now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Denzel was racking his brain trying to figure it out, his phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second he picked up, a panicked voice shouted through the line. "Mr. Denzel Vaughn, something terrible has happened! Someone has dumped a massive pile of dirt about you and the company online. On top of that, we're getting hammered by some mysterious foreign capital. Glory Group's stock is crashing hard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Denzel barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face went pale, and the moment the words hit him, the erection he still had inside the secretary went completely limp. He scrambled to pull up the company's stock chart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Denzel saw the steep plunge, both he and Victor were struck with fear. The crash was happening even faster than what had happened with the Anastasia Group. In just moments, Glory Group had lost over 30 billion dollars in market value, and it was still falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goddamn it! Who the hell is behind this?" Denzel snapped. "Don't just stand there! Go pull the funds out now and stop the bleeding! And get a public statement out. Shut down those rumors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had planned to use this chance to completely destroy Anastasia, and force her to surrender to him once and for all. Never in a million years did he expect someone else to blindside him and launch a full-on attack on his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with Denzel pulling out funds and issuing statements to refute the rumors, nothing worked. Within just one day, Glory Group lost a staggering 80 billion dollars in value, and the drop showed no signs of stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"W-What the hell is happening..." Denzel looked like he'd been struck by lightning. His face was drained of all color, and unable to take the blow, he collapsed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor and the secretary both panicked and rushed to catch him. "Mr. Denzel Vaughn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He anxiously called out, "Mr. Denzel Vaughn! Are you alright? Mr. Denzel Vaughn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of them noticed the security camera on the desk, quietly recording the entire scene, and just moments later, the footage was uploaded online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Very soon, a sensational headline swept across major news outlets: "Glory Group's CEO Denzel Vaughn Caught Having Sex with Secretary in Office&mdash;Dies on the Spot from a Sudden Heart Attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The steamy footage instantly stirred up a frenzy online, drawing in countless viewers and sparking heated discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One user commented: [That's the infamous CEO of Glory Group? Not much to look at, huh? Doesn't even measure up to me down there.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another dropped a laughing emoji and added: [Man, Denzel's junk is tiny. Straight up baby-sized.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else commented: [Seriously? The company's stock has been crashing nonstop, and this guy still got the mood to screw his secretary in the office? No wonder he croaked from a heart attack.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another wrote: [Well damn, they weren't kidding when they said some bosses really keep their secretaries busy. Didn't expect to witness it firsthand.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And another commented: [Never thought Denzel would turn out to be such a scumbag. Honestly, he had it coming.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Glory Group was plunged into a bottomless pit, all thanks to that explosive news clip. Even the Vaughn family, all the way in Azuriath State, got caught in the fallout. Their reputation took a massive hit, especially since Denzel had been one of the family's five key successors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Brian was lounging in the villa's garden, sipping his coffee while casually scrolling through the online reactions. A satisfied smile tugged at his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Velmara really didn't let me down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, Brian pulled out his phone and shot off a message to Velmara: [Nice work.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thrilled by the praise, Velmara quickly replied: [What's my reward, Mr. Edwards?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian responded: [What do you want?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara wrote back: [I want to eat your cooking, Mr. Edwards.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian replied: [You little foodie. Come over tomorrow. I'll cook for you.]</span></p></div>
