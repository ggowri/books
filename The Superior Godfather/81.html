        <h1>Chapter 81 Change Attitude</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evans Villa was bustling with guests, the atmosphere vibrant and lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To dispel the embarrassment they had faced recently, Robert and Mary had gathered friends and family to announce the news: Ryan was set to meet the Master of the War Deities and was about to join their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone turned to Sophia with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, a mature and charismatic woman, was particularly animated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, is what your parents said true? Ryan is being summoned by the Master of the War Deities and is about to join them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ryan truly became a member of the War Deities, it would effortlessly solve her 20 million dollars in high-interest debts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sophia saw the astonished expressions on everyone's faces, a wave of pride washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and replied, "Aunt Karen, it's all true! Ryan has a cousin who is one of the Twelve Blades of the War Deities, the Unparalleled Blade, and he's the one who recommended Ryan to the Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sophia's confirmation, the crowd erupted in compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my gosh, is that really the case? Sophia, your taste is impeccable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! What does it matter that Brian became a partner at Trillion Group? He can't hold a candle to our Ryan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan truly is top among men. Sophia, your judgment is spot on; you've got to look out for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? Our family is counting on you to bring us honor and glory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the flattery poured in, Sophia, Robert, and Mary basked in their moment of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had faced a barrage of criticism when Brian became a partner at Trillion Group after Sophia's divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the adoration directed at Sophia, Anne felt a mix of emotions, a sense of unease creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ryan successfully joined the War Deities, it would spell disaster for Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only hope he had followed her advice and gone to Polandia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Sophia's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, answer it! It's probably Ryan calling with good news!" Mary urged, a smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding, Sophia pressed the button to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, is this Ms. Sophia Evans, Ryan's fianc&eacute;e? This is the Riverwood Police Department. I'm afraid Ryan has suffered a psychological breakdown and has jumped from a building... you'll need to come identify the body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice on the other end struck Sophia like a bolt from the blue, leaving her frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"W-what? You... you said Ryan jumped?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, please come to the Beach Hotel to identify the body..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer's words hit her like a freight train, and the weight of the news overwhelmed her. Her vision darkened, and she collapsed, the phone slipping from her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the officer's voice echoed from the ground, frantic and urgent. "Hello? Ms. Sophia Evans, can you hear me? Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden turn of events sent Robert and Mary into a panic, rushing to support her as she swayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, what's going on? What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sophia slowly regained her composure, she recounted the shocking news to the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? Ryan suffered a breakdown and jumped down the building?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary's faces turned ashen, as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne and Karen stood frozen, their expressions a mix of disbelief and horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The friends and family present were equally stunned, their faces reflecting shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, one of the guests changed his demeanor entirely, looking at Sophia and her family with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, what a waste of time! I really thought Ryan was going to join the War Deities. Turns out he's just a flash in the pan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? We bought all these gifts for nothing... might as well take them back for ourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! It would be a waste to leave them with Sophia's family; they'll never recover from this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they gathered their gifts and left the Evans Villa, leaving Sophia, Robert, and Mary dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces shifted between shades of blush and pallor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were unable to comprehend the sheer superficiality of these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow was devastating, as if they had fallen from paradise into the depths of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long, heavy silence, Mary finally found her voice. "How... how could this happen? Sophia, what exactly went wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would Ryan have a breakdown and kill himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's voice was laced with bitterness as she spoke softly, her heart heavy, "I... I don't know!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to the Beach Hotel and identify the body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they arrived at the Beach Hotel, where the grim reality awaited them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, you bastard, get up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, you promised you'd love me forever! Come on, get up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she looked at Ryan's lifeless form, Sophia couldn't hold back her tears any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She broke down, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had even set a wedding date, planning to marry once he joined the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, all of that was shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary stood by, their faces pale, struggling to understand how everything had spiraled so drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Anne and Karen had never been particularly close to Ryan, they wore expressions of complex emotions, caught in the gravity of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, upstairs, Brian stood by the window, coldly observing the heartbroken Sophia below, his expression devoid of any emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Anne felt a strange sensation and glanced up toward the upper floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she spotted Brian sitting there, she froze in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "What's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is Brian here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't he take the flight I booked for him to Polandia?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or does Ryan's death somehow involve him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind raced with confusion and suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, sensing her gaze, offered a slight smile before rising and disappearing from her view.</span></p></div>
