        <h1>Chapter 154 Get Their Investments Back</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza said, "Ms. Vaughn, you need to see this news video online."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia glanced at the headline Eliza pointed to, completely stunned. "Glory Group's CEO Denzel dies from heart attack during sex with secretary in the office? What kind of headline is this? That can't be real, right?" Curiosity and disbelief written all over her face, she moved the mouse and clicked on the link.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the video started playing, the explicit scene unfolded, leaving both Anastasia and Eliza blurting out in sync, "What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had assumed it was just a sensational hoax. But to their utter shock, it turned out to be real. Just recalling that footage made their cheeks burn with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them had expected Denzel to be that kind of person behind closed doors. Anastasia glanced at Glory Group's plummeting stock chart&mdash;it had completely tanked. But she still wasn't convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait... is Denzel really dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia paused for a moment and then decided to make a call to check on things herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the VIP room at St. Peter's Hospital, Denzel finally regained consciousness after emergency treatment from the medical team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very first thing he asked was, "Victor, how's the company stock doing right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor looked pained as he tried to soothe him. "You need to focus on recovering for now, Mr. Denzel Vaughn. Let's not worry about the company just yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's face darkened. He suddenly grabbed Victor by the collar and snapped, "I asked you&mdash;how bad is the stock?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short hesitation, Victor handed over his phone and said, "You'd better see it for yourself, Mr. Denzel Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the plunging numbers, Denzel looked completely shocked. "How did it drop this fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it keeps crashing like this, everything we've worked for over the years will be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's expression grew even more bitter. "Mr. Denzel Vaughn... this might just be the beginning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's brows furrowed deeply. He asked in a low, serious voice, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor replied, "Someone hacked into your computer. The whole thing about you hooking up with your secretary and collapsing in the office is all over the internet now... and there's even a rumor going around that you're dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Denzel heard those words, he felt like he'd been hit by a freight train. As he stared at the flood of videos and rumors spreading online, the shock overwhelmed him. His eyes rolled back, and he passed out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor panicked. "Doctor! Somebody get the doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the emergency care from the medical team, Denzel eventually came to. Just then, his phone rang. It was a call from his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he answered, he was hit with a furious barrage of yelling. "You damn disgrace of a son! Have you seen the mess you've made? You've dragged the Vaughn family name through the mud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's father continued, "Your grandfather blew up when he found out. He wanted to strip you of your successor status on the spot. It was only after your mother and I begged him endlessly that he agreed to give you one last chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you now&mdash;if you don't clean up this mess within seven days, your right to inherit will be revoked for good. And when that happens, you're no longer one of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Denzel could even say a word, his father hung up on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was truly disappointed in him. It was one thing to mess around with a secretary&mdash;nobody would've batted an eye. But Denzel had been careless, didn't cover his tracks, and ended up getting played. Now the whole thing was splashed all over the internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the call that had just ended and thinking about everything that had happened in just the past two days, Denzel looked pale as a ghost. A wave of bitter defeat surged through him. He never imagined he'd end up in a situation like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things weren't about to let up. Just as he was still trying to process it all, his phone started blowing up again&mdash;this time with calls from shareholders. Some tore into him with harsh words, demanding accountability. Others said they were disappointed and wanted to pull out their investments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel had just barely managed to deal with the shareholders when Thomas, Eric, Zac, and a few others suddenly burst into the hospital room in a rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had seen the overwhelming wave of news online as well. The expos&eacute;s that had surfaced were so damning it left them deeply unsettled&mdash;none of them dared to continue working with Denzel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially now that Denzel himself was barely keeping it together. So, naturally, they had come to get their investments back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered, one of them quickly asked, "How are you doing, Mr. Denzel Vaughn? Are you feeling any better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, "I hope your condition is not too serious, Mr. Denzel Vaughn. You really should take better care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the concern written all over their faces, Denzel couldn't help but feel a pang of emotion. He never would've expected that, at a time like this, the people who seemed to care the most would be them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a breath, steadying himself before forcing a faint smile. "Don't worry, everyone. I'm alright. So, what brings you all here in such a hurry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Thomas, Zac, and the others exchanged glances and hesitated for a beat. Then, one of them finally spoke up, "Mr. Denzel Vaughn, we... we'd like to pull our investments and withdraw from the partnership. We hope you can return the money we put in."</span></p></div>
