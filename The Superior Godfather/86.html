        <h1>Chapter 86 Karen's Repayment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian's eyes scanned her, Karen's face hardened, a flicker of cold resentment flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for him, she wouldn't have lost her job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if she hadn't lost her job, she wouldn't have been driven to such desperation by the loan sharks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're coming to me for help with that attitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's temper flared. "Brian, don't think just because you've got some money now that you're so important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Anne's expression shifted, and she quickly stepped in, covering Karen's mouth and pulling her aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was firm but gentle. "Karen, Brian's the only one who can help you with that debt. If you burn bridges with him now, you'll be stuck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know how those loan sharks operate. Do you really want to be sold overseas as a prostitute?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fear hit her like a cold wave, draining the color from Karen's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne didn't let up. "Brian isn't unreasonable. I've spoken to him. If you apologize and show him some respect, he'll agree to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen hesitated, then nodded reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll try talking to him properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good luck." Anne gave her a quick thumbs-up before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still a little unsteady after her intimacy with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been overwhelming earlier, leaving her legs trembling and a searing pain still burning deep inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the living room was down to just Karen and Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment before walking up to him, her teeth clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I've been wrong. I shouldn't have looked down on you or made fun of you. I'm sorry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, help me just this once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she gave him a deep bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she moved, the collar of her shirt slipped, revealing a hint of her neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft pink fabric barely contained her curves, as if they might spill out at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure, gracefully curved and confident, was undeniably striking, exuding an air of mature elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Brian, still a little thrown off by the earlier sex, felt a stir of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a slight smirk, his eyes sweeping over her body with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helping you isn't a problem, but 20 million is a lot of money. What do you plan to do to repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen felt the heat rise in her cheeks, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was unemployed, with nothing substantial to offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, if you lend me the money, I'll find a way to pay you back," she said, her voice low and sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression shifted, a hint of mockery in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty million is a serious amount. You don't even have a decent job right now. How do you expect to repay me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't figure that out, maybe you should leave. Come back when you've thought it through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation crept into Karen's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I don't have anything to give you now, but once I get through this, I'll make it up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stood up, stretching lazily and walking toward the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's late. I need to rest. You should go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen felt a wave of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't get his help, the consequences would be unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of what the loan sharks could do to her made her heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, with tears welling up in her eyes, she began slowly unbuttoning her blouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian paused, confusion flashing in his eyes as he watched her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her fists, then quickly shrugged off her shirt, revealing her stunning, confident figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of her curves was enough to leave Brian in stunned silence, his breath caught in his throat as his body reacted involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's voice trembled but remained steady. "If you help me, I'll repay you however you want."</span></p></div>
