        <h1>Chapter 10 Badass</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wh-What the fuck is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's face contorted in shock, his eyes bulging in sheer horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react and change his stance, Brian lashed out with a brutal kick to his knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's kneecap shattered on impact, and he crumpled right in front of Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he tried to push himself up, Brian stomped his right foot down hard on Raven's shoulder, pinning him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who... who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's face had turned as white as a ghost sheet. His gaze towards Brian was filled with such terror that it was as if he'd just seen a real-life specter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never in his wildest dreams expected Brian to be this badass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took a long drag from his cigarette and blew a thick cloud of smoke right in Raven's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was as cold as ice and brooked no argument. "Spit it out. Who shelled out two million dollars to put me six feet under?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were left gobsmacked as they watched Brian dominate Raven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had thought Brian was toast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who'd have thought he'd wipe the floor with Raven and his crew?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the ladies in the place went absolutely nuts. Their eyes were practically on fire with admiration and lust as they ogled Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter who'd earlier given Brian a heads-up to scram was also left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap! This dude's a total badass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He single-handedly took down almost a hundred of Raven's goons? You've gotta be kidding me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! Is he some kind of superhero? I've never seen a guy this tough in my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god! He's so hot and amazing. I'm totally swooning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... How can this be happening?" Tyrone gaped at Brian, his face a picture of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was nothing like he'd anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia wore a smile, murmuring, "Well, well, well. He's got some serious skills. Has he fully regained his energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a glint of admiration in her eyes as she sized up Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to admit, at this moment, Brian exuded an air of pure dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He radiated a raw masculinity and an aura of a true warrior that was impossible to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly found herself more intrigued by this man than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of ratting out Ryan, Raven clamped his teeth down hard and glared defiantly at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're one hell of a fighter, I'll give you that. But I'm a top dog in the Shadow Fang. If you've got any sense left in that thick skull of yours, let me go and beg for mercy. Maybe we'll cut you some slack. Otherwise, the Shadow Fang will hunt you down like a dog."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Brian's eyes narrowed, and he fell into a thoughtful silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether he let Raven live or snuffed him out, it seemed like he was in for a world of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking Brian was starting to crack under pressure, Raven scoffed. "What? Scared now, punk? Let me tell you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish his sentence, Brian backhanded him across the face with a stinging slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you one chance. Call your boss and tell him to haul his ass over here right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian liked to nip problems in the bud and avoid any future drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether he killed or spared Raven, the Shadow Fang would come after him for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he figured it'd be better to have the big cheese of the Shadow Fang come over and settle things once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven cupped his stinging face, completely flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you for real? You want me to call our boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around them exchanged looks of utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he seriously going to take on the boss of the Shadow Fang?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That guy's the kingpin in Riverwood, a real heavy-hitter in both the legitimate and underworld scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And this guy wants Raven to call her over? He's got some serious balls!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was also taken aback, and her smile grew even wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face was like a stone, cold and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped Raven again, this time even harder. "Stop your blabbering and make the call, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're digging your own grave. Don't say I didn't warn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven shot Brian a look full of hatred and spite, then quickly whipped out his phone and started dialing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before the deafening rumble of car engines filled the air outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of sleek black Land Rovers came tearing in like a pack of wild beasts, screeching to a stop right in front of the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out stepped a smoking-hot woman in black, strutting in with an army of Shadow Fang goons in sharp black suits trailing behind her. They swarmed into the bar, leaving no room to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was a real knockout. There was a sick-looking Shadow Fang tattoo on her neck that added to her badass vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her body was the stuff of dreams. The way her curves were on full display in that skimpy black cropped leather jacket and tiny shorts was enough to make any guy's head spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she sashayed in, her chest bounced with every step, and her hips swayed like she was dancing to a secret rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like she had some kind of magical power to turn men into drooling messes. One look at her and one'd feel like one's insides were on fire. She was a total temptress, pure and simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this beauty? She was Zoe Guzman, the big boss of the Shadow Fang gang. Her code name? Crimson Demonic Ascendance.</span></p></div>
