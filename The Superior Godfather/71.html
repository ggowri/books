        <h1>Chapter 71 Heartbeat and Excitement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, God!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation between his legs made Brian's heart race and his breath quicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smiled faintly, removed her heels, and began to tease with her feet wrapped in black stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he gazed at her feet wrapped in black stockings, Brian couldn't help but swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman certainly knew how to seduce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined thrill of Zoe's actions and the fear of being caught made Brian excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it? Excited?" Just as Brian was about to speak, Zoe withdrew her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian exhaled in relief, but a sudden wave of melancholy and longing settled in his heart. The experience was truly one of a kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Brian's emotions, Zoe gave a faint smile and deliberately dropped the coffee spoon beneath the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the excuse of retrieving the coffee spoon, Zoe slid beneath the table, kneeling in front of Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a look of confusion in Brian's eyes, Zoe unzipped his trousers, took his penis into her mouth, and started to tease him gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, my God!" The intense sensation made Brian gasp in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearing being caught, he quickly covered his mouth with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at Zoe, who was busy kneeling in front of him. The excitement was so intense that his heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected Zoe to be so bold and to taste it in a coffee shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't she worried about being seen or caught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's heart raced, his breath quickened, and he nervously scanned the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally relaxed when he noticed that everyone in the caf&eacute; was either glued to their phones, reading newspapers, or chatting with friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a woman reading in front of him seemed to sense something and lifted her head, looking in Brian's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt nervous, his heart racing with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to stay calm, offering the woman a polite smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman nodded slightly, smiled back at him, and then returned to her book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's tense nerves finally relaxed, allowing him to enjoy Zoe's tender attentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill of this scene was far more intense than anything he'd ever experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the sound of a coffee spoon clattering to the ground echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian glanced toward the sound and saw a little girl's coffee spoon had fallen on the floor nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hand was gripping the table to pick up the spoon, but the reach wasn't long enough to grab it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young mother sitting opposite her bent down and chose to help. As long as she raised her head, she could see the scene under Brian's table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Brian tense up once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the young mother didn't notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian could celebrate, a sudden ringtone emerged from under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp ringtone echoed throughout the caf&eacute;, causing Brian's expression to change dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could notice, he quickly adjusted his trousers and sat there, sipping his coffee nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, equally startled by the sudden ringtone, tried to stay composed. Crawling out from under the table, she took out her phone and answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call connected, and Sam's voice came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, what did Master say? Did he agree to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still angry about nearly being exposed by the ringtone, Zoe replied irritably, "Agree with you? Sam, you bastard, go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she abruptly hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the luxurious club, Sam listened to the dial tone, utterly confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Damn, what happened? Why did that crazy woman blow up at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to call back for an explanation, only to find he had been blacklisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam was even more perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? I didn't offend you!"</span></p></div>
