        <h1>Chapter 42 Unbelievable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene erupted into chaos once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Celeste in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this woman be having an affair with Brian, using her position to boost his career?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that was true, she had some severe nerve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Sophia smiled slyly as they spoke up loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now everyone can see what's happening here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never betrayed or abandoned Brian. He cheated first by hooking up with Celeste, then used their dirty relationship to secure the Trillion Group deal! They're nothing but shameless adulterers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We ask Mr. Wright, the Trillion Group executives, and everyone present to help us clear our names and serve justice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Mark watched Aria and Anastasia with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies, you haven't won that bet after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood up and addressed Kevin directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, please help clear Mr. Carter and his associates' names!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The supporters of Ryan and Sophia all stood up and joined in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, please serve justice for Mr. Carter and his team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, it was clear they had to cozy up to Ryan! He was sure to become a partner at the Trillion Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria frowned, her face darkening as she remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia watched the scene with amusement, utterly unconcerned about Brian's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others might not know Brian's true identity, she knew who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face turned cold instantly at the scene before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe Sophia's nerves and her man's, brazenly twisting the truth and trying to play the victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this played right into his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered what kind of mess this pathetic couple would stir up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste fixed an icy stare at Kevin and the Trillion Group executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were eager to dig their graves, she'd happily help them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke with a sneer on her face, "You accuse me of having an affair with Brian and abusing my power to put him in position? That's ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, the evidence is right in front of us. How dare you deny it?" Kevin stepped forward and shouted, pointing at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step down as president of Trillion Group immediately, or we'll hold you accountable for all the damage you've done to the company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was thrilled inside. Once Celeste stepped down, he would become the new president of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make me step down? You don't have that authority!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste let out a cold laugh and spoke calmly, "You all chose Ryan and the Carter Group, but our new chairman, our company's largest shareholder, overruled that decision!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian and Transcendent Construction Group became our partners not because I abused my power but because our new chairman personally selected them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My relationship with Brian is entirely professional. I've only been following the chairman's orders!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never imagined you would twist the facts like this... It's despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Brian in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was the partnership candidate personally chosen by Trillion Group's mysterious new chairman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was stunned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was frozen in shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark and Paul stood there dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Trillion Group executives and Ryan's supporters stared in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?" someone muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How does that loser know the new chairman of Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's and Ryan's eyes widened as they gaped at Brian in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Kevin didn't know the new chairman! How could a nobody like Brian have such connections?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was entirely beyond their comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting. It seems my judgment wasn't wrong after all," Aria said with a slight smirk, her eyes fixed intently on Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Brian's charisma was genuinely dazzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled charmingly and said, "That guy knows how to play his cards. I bet Sophia is kicking herself right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their initial shock, Ryan and Sophia finally returned to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to accept what they were seeing, they started screaming like lunatics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible... absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian is nothing but a worthless bum! There's no way he could know the new chairman of Trillion Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must all be a lie! Celeste is trying to fool everyone!"</span></p></div>
