        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't hurt him. I'll drink with you," Anastasia interjected, her expression paling as she stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she wanted to test Brian's resolve, she didn't want him to suffer or get hurt for no reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian remained silent, focusing inward to calm the chaotic energy churning within him, waiting for the storm to pass before he could harness that power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was ready, handling these thugs would be a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! What a coward..." Tyrone scoffed, his contempt deepening as he saw Brian stay quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat into Brian's drink, a cruel smirk spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrone then reached out, intending to encircle Anastasia's enticing waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, beautiful. This weakling can't satisfy you. Join us for some fun..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as his hand was about to graze her, a menacing glint flashed in Brian's eyes. He lunged forward, gripping Tyrone's wrist with a firm hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the chaotic energy within him vanished completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you..." Tyrone's eyes widened in shock as he sensed the sudden shift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Brian twisted his wrist in a swift joint-lock maneuver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh..." A sharp scream tore from Tyrone's lips as he felt his arm dislocate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You'll pay for this..." Tyrone spat, his face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd barely opened a move to fight back when Brian lunged for the wine bottle on the table and whacked it right across his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bottle shattered against Brian, and blood flowed from Tyrone's gash, quickly soaking his shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Duffy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit! You dare strike Mr. Duffy? You're asking for big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrone's henchmen looked on in shock, panic surging in their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly drew their knives, lunging at Brian from either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift sidestep, Brian dodged their attacks and swept his leg out, sending both thugs crashing into a nearby table, unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tyrone scrambled to recover and prepare for another strike, Brian seized him by the throat, lifting him off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrone felt a wave of suffocating pressure envelop him, making him squirm, but his resistance was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was so full of myself. I'll fix this mess. Please, give me a break..." Tyrone panted, with desperation seeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spare you?" Brian's eyes glimmered with cold determination as he picked up the glass Tyrone had just defiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chug this down, and I'll cut you loose. Deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the intensity of Brian's grip weighing on him, Tyrone nodded slowly, fear plain on his face. "I... I'll drink it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tyrone was about to down the drink, Brian called out, stopping him, "Hold on a second..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, Tyrone watched as Brian spat a thick glob of phlegm into the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you can drink up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Tyrone's expression turned gloomy, but he was powerless against Brian's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was swallow his pride and the disgusting drink, humiliation washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vile concoction settled in his stomach, nausea hit him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh... You little punk, if you've got any balls, don't you dare run away! I ain't gonna let you off the hook today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrone spat out a few curses and staggered toward the exit, stumbling out of the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Onlookers were left in stunned silence, their jaws dropped at the unfolding scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, they had thought Brian was just a coward for staying quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know he was a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia flashed a smile, her eyes now alight with even greater admiration for Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It never crossed her mind that Brian, once drained of energy and reduced to a useless bloke, still had such moves up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could his energy be making a comeback?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with Tyrone, Brian turned to Anastasia, concern etched on his face. "Ms. Vaughn, you good? You are not hurt, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia shook her head with a smile. "I'm fine... How about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian just scoffed. "A bunch of low-lives like that? No way they could lay a finger on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing that Brian and Anastasia weren't leaving after the ruckus, a well-meaning waiter scurried over to give them a friendly nudge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you'd better leave. See, Tyrone's sister's husband, Raven, is a heavyweight in the Shadow Fang, the biggest gang in town. He's probably gone to rally the troops. You gotta get outta here pronto, or you're toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia wavered for a second, then looked up at Brian. "Mr. Edwards, the Shadow Fang is no joke. They're a force to be reckoned with. Maybe we should beat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her litmus test for Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he decided to drag her out of there right then, it'd be game over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd have no problem coming clean about who she was and calling off the engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Anastasia was after was a real man, a guy with guts who could stand up for her and make her feel secure, not a yellow-bellied coward who'd tuck tail and run.</span></p></div>
