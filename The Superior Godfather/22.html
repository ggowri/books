        <h1>Chapter 22 Zoe's Temptation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the lavish Riverside Villa No. 9, everything was pristine. The decoration was luxurious, and the place was fully equipped with top-of-the-line appliances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was pleased with the results, especially when it came to the interior design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting comfortably on the couch, a glass of red wine in hand, he looked at Anastasia with appreciation in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, thanks again for stepping in earlier. You really saved me back there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her quick thinking had given him the satisfaction of getting back at Sophia, and he couldn't help but feel a little victorious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You saved face and now all you've got is a 'thank you'? That's it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She crossed her long, toned legs and elegantly took a sip of her wine, her eyes glinting with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard not to notice the effortless grace she exuded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every gesture and smile screamed confidence and charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs, enhanced by high heels, looked even longer and more seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his position across from her, Brian couldn't help but notice the tempting sight just under her skirt, sparking a surge of desire in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly cleared his mind, forcing away the thoughts that were starting to wander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, how about I take you out to dinner to show my gratitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow, a playful grin on her lips. "Hmm, at least you're showing some effort. That's better than nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she said that, her phone slipped from the couch and fell to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she bent over to pick it up, the neckline of her dress dipped slightly, giving Brian an accidental, but unmistakable view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate lace lingerie clung to her curves, and the sight of it nearly made his heart stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those curves were impossibly alluring, full, round, and perfectly shaped, hard to look away from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn..." he couldn't help but mutter to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's figure was nothing short of breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combination of her elegant, almost untouchable presence stirred something deep in Brian, a fierce, uncontrollable desire to possess her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oblivious to the effect she had on him, she straightened up and smiled. "So, where are we going for this dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian reluctantly tore his gaze away and gave a small, guilty smile. "I was thinking... instead of going out to eat, why don't I cook for you instead? Show you my cooking skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? Cooking?" She looked at him with a raised eyebrow, clearly skeptical. "You're kidding, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't every day you saw a man in Eldoria who could cook, let alone be willing to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just sit tight and wait," Brian said with a grin before heading out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after stepping outside, he realized a problem. There wasn't a market nearby, and he didn't have a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for a moment, then dialed Zoe, asking her to send someone with some fresh ingredients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sleek red Ferrari pulled up at the intersection, its engine purring like a wild beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The window slid down, revealing Zoe's stunning, sultry face. Her black, waist-baring crop top clung to her curves, accentuating her mature, seductive figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised a brow. "Didn't I tell you to send someone else? Why'd you come yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's gaze roamed over his toned body, heat flickering in her eyes. She leaned in slightly, her chest subtly shifting with the movement, and pouted, "Come on. I missed you! Don't tell me you don't miss me too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes instinctively drifted downward, drawn to the tantalizing rise and fall of her curves. He swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching his reaction, Zoe smirked, her voice dripping with mischief. "What's wrong? Feeling a little tense again? Need me to take care of it? I hear the backseat's way more fun than a hotel room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, she took his hand and slipped it right under her neckline, pressing it against the soft, full swell beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Get in already. Just give me this one little moment, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shockingly smooth, velvety sensation filled Brian's palm, making his breath hitch and his pulse quicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as heat surged through him, his gaze flickered toward Riverside Villa No. 9 in the distance. Through the window, Anastasia's graceful silhouette was visible. The sight pulled him back from the edge, forcing him to push down the fire burning inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, cut it out. I've got someone waiting for me at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So? Let her wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful smirk, Zoe swung the door open and pushed Brian into the car, straddling him in one smooth motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing turned ragged as her intoxicating scent filled the small space between them. Up close, her teasing smile, those mesmerizing eyes and the way her body pressed against his were enough to drive any man insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you even a little curious about what I'm wearing underneath?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's slender fingers trailed down her neck, gliding over her skin before stopping at the swell of her chest. With a teasing smile, she tugged down her neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a deep, creamy valley of cleavage was on full display, her curves barely restrained by delicate black lace. The contrast was striking, soft, pale skin against the dark fabric, drawing Brian's eyes like a magnet, sending a rush of heat straight through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power coursing through his veins, the bloodline of a Warlord, had always made his hunger for women stronger than most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just moments ago, Anastasia's unintentional allure had already lit the fuse. Now, faced with Zoe's bold temptation, there was no way he could hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp inhale, his hands moved on their own, seizing those full, supple curves, his fingers sinking into the impossibly soft flesh.</span></p></div>
