        <h1>Chapter 161 Brian Was Livid</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tucker and the others didn't hold back&mdash;they went straight for the jugular. "How about this?" one of them said. "If your company is willing to give up 50% of the net profit and throw in a batch of products worth 50 million dollars for us to test out for free, then we've got a deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was caught off guard.</span><br><span>They're just offering access to their sales channels, and they want 50% of our profits and 50 million dollars worth of free samples? Damn, these guys are greedy as hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the truth was, Trillion Group did desperately needed their distribution network to break the EnerGlow Series into the market and salvage the company's plummeting value. So in the end, Brian gave in. "Alright. We accept your terms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes widened in shock the moment she heard that. Meanwhile, Tucker, Lyle, and the others grinned with satisfaction. "You certainly don't waste time, Mr. Edwards. But, we've got one more condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian clenched his jaw, keeping the anger in check. "What condition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tucker, Lyle, and the other turned to look at Celeste, and sleazy smirks crept across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said, "Oh, it's nothing big. Just a small favor, really. Mr. Edwards, we've admired Ms. Hawthorne for a long time now. Love at first sight, you could say. And those legs of hers? Man, just looking at them drives us nuts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, "We've been with more women than we can count, but she's something else. A total knockout. If you're willing to let us take turns with her, Mr. Edwards, then the deal's as good as done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then the third added, "Come on, Mr. Edwards. For the bright future of Trillion Group, surely you're not going to get stingy over just one woman, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, Celeste's face instantly darkened. She hadn't expected these pigs to actually come after her like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression turned cold too, and a dangerous glint flashed deep in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">These filthy bastards... they really don't know when to quit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tucker and Lyle glanced at each other and then Lyle said, "Since you're not saying anything, Mr. Edwards, we'll take that as a yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian could even respond, they couldn't hold back anymore&mdash;they reached straight for Celeste's thighs and chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tucker said, "Come on, Ms. Hawthorne, have a little fun with us. Don't worry, we'll treat you real nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lyle added, "Yeah, come here, sweetheart. Let me feel those legs and give those pretty tits a little massage..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as their hands were about to land on Celeste, Brian yanked her behind him and grabbed a wine bottle off the table, smashing it straight across their heads. "Motherfucker," he growled. "Screw you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crash! The bottle shattered against Tucker and Lyle's skulls the next second, splitting their heads open. Blood mixed with alcohol poured down their faces, soaking their shirts in a sickening wash of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They collapsed to the floor, clutching their heads and shrieking like slaughtered pigs, pain twisting their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden violence left the other four men completely stunned. They stared at Brian in disbelief, horrified that he'd actually gone this far for a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially since just moments ago, when they'd demanded 50% of the profits and asked for 50 million dollars worth of free products, Brian hadn't even said no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Celeste hadn't seen it coming. She never imagined Brian would actually go head-to-head with these people for her. But now, seeing him standing there between her and the rest of them, tall and unyielding, an unexpected sense of safety welled up in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So this is what it feels like to have someone protect you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of stunned silence, the others finally snapped out of it and rushed to help Tucker and Lyle off the floor. "Mr. Wilson! Mr. Porter! Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tucker and Lyle clutched their heads, glaring daggers at Brian, their eyes burning with open fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd never imagined Brian would dare attack them, especially not now, when he was supposedly the one desperate to cooperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tucker's face twisted with rage as he stared at Brian and bellowed, "Are you out of your damn mind? All this for a woman? Really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you apologize to us right now and let us have some fun with this woman for a few months, we might still consider the deal. Otherwise&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Tucker could even finish, Brian slapped him hard across the face. "Otherwise, my ass. Fuck you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap cracked through the room. Tucker's teeth shattered on impact, and his face contorted grotesquely as he flew backward like a rag doll, slamming into the wall with a sickening thud. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he crumpled to the ground, completely out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Lyle's face instantly twisted in fury. "Brian, you're dead!" He turned to the door and barked, "Brutus! Where the hell are you? Get in here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he shouted, a bald hulk of a man charged in with over a dozen bodyguards, all storming in like a wrecking crew.</span></p></div>
