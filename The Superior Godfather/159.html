        <h1>Chapter 159 Spanking</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that, Celeste narrowed her eyes slightly, a flicker of surprise and unease flashing across her gaze. "A Meta?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really hadn't expected this busty little girl to be a Meta, let alone one who had such precise control over her powers. That kind of finesse? She was definitely a high-level Meta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, Metas were incredibly rare. They trained with energy, wielded supernatural powers, and their bodies had long since broken through the limits of human strength. Their combat abilities were off the charts, and their place in society? Practically untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those at the top tiers were even more formidable and were practically titans in their own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste never would've guessed Brian had ties to someone like that. The more she learned, the harder he became to read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Velmara ignored her completely. With a cold snort, she turned and walked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had zero patience for a woman who messed up her plans, ruined her fun, treated her like a kid, and still had the nerve to flirt with Brian. No way was she letting that slide without a warning shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much as she hated to admit it, Velmara had to give credit where it was due. Celeste really did have the looks and the body, and those legs were just insane. Even Velmara felt a twinge of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, seeing the situation, gave a helpless smile and turned to Celeste. "Velmara has always been like that. Don't take it personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled back. "You think I'm that petty? Besides, I did misspeak earlier. If you can, help me pass along an apology. I just didn't expect her to be a high-level Meta..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian could respond, Celeste continued, "First, it was Ms. Guzman from Shadow Fang. Then you pulled in tens of billions of dollars to bail the company out. And now, this high-level Meta? Brian, you're full of surprises. What else are you hiding from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's lips curled up, clearly entertained. "You really want to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste gave a playful smile, crossing her long, black-stockinged legs as her hips curved into an eye-catching arc. "What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze dropped to her legs, his throat tightening. He joked, "Come sit on my lap and let me touch those legs, then I'll tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smirked and sat down beside him. "Seriously?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian swallowed hard. "Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste gave a soft smile. "Go ahead then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian swallowed hard. He couldn't hold back anymore and had just reached out, ready to feel those silky legs in black stockings, when she suddenly jumped to the side and snapped, "You really thought I was serious, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Please. I know exactly how guys like him think. The easier something is to get, the less they care about it. No way I'm letting him off that easy. Gotta keep him chasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his hand landed on nothing, Brian was hit with a sudden, inexplicable wave of disappointment. He looked up, putting on an exaggerated scowl as he stared at Celeste. "Really, Celeste? You're actually messing with me now? Oh, you're so getting it today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he lunged at Celeste like a big bad wolf, both arms stretched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Celeste yelped, quickly dodging away. She grabbed a pillow from the couch and hurled it straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian ducked to the side, dodging the incoming cushion, and then pounced again. Seeing this, she bolted around the table, turning their living room into a game of cat and mouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Celeste couldn't outrun him. He tackled her down onto the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze dropped to her curvy hips wrapped snugly in that pencil skirt, and without a second thought, he lifted his hand and smacked her on the butt&mdash;smack&mdash;the sharp sound rang out clearly in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's body jolted from the impact as if a jolt of electricity had shot through her entire frame. She let out an involuntary moan, low and breathy. "Mmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound nearly made Brian lose it. Coupled with the incredible softness and bounce beneath his palm, he couldn't help himself&mdash;he raised his hand and gave her another spank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mess with me, huh? You gonna try that again next time?" he teased as he gave Celeste three firm spanks, one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until she finally gave in and begged him to stop that Brian backed off and let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's cheeks were burning red as she lay sprawled on the couch, gasping for air. She'd always kept herself composed, barely ever interacting with men outside of work&mdash;let alone anything even close to this kind of physical contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after getting spanked like that again and again, Celeste felt her entire body go limp and powerless like she was about to melt right into Brian's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just imagining how she, the CEO of a major company, had ended up with him spanking her over the couch made Celeste flush deep red, her teeth clenching as a wave of shame surged through her. "You&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just about to lash out when Brian suddenly switched gears, acting all serious. "Alright, enough of that. So, what brings you here today, anyway?"</span></p></div>
