        <h1>Chapter 52 The Seductive Aunt</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Celeste was serious, the room fell silent. Everyone looked at each other, completely at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trillion Group was at its peak, with limitless potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Kevin's scandal had caused a huge stir and sent the stock prices plummeting, they were bound to bounce back. Only fools would pull out their investments at a time like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' face twisted in anger. He glared at Celeste, his fists clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the silence in the room, Celeste curled her lips into a mocking smile, her eyes filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since no one is actually willing to pull out, then just sit tight and keep waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At five in the afternoon, a Pagani Huayra pulled up outside Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stepped out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to talk to Aria about the outsourcing deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good afternoon, sir. How can I assist you?" The pretty receptionist greeted him warmly as soon as he walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd like to see Ms. Jenkins. Could you let her know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist hesitated, "Sir, do you have an appointment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian replied, "Ms. Jenkins mentioned she wanted to have dinner with me last night, so I came early. I don't have an appointment. My name is Brian Edwards. She'll see me if you tell her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist looked a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was extremely busy, efficient, and highly respected. She didn't dare disturb her lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, this was the first time she'd heard that Aria had invited a man to dinner. She wasn't sure if Brian was telling the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, plenty of men had tried to see Aria under various pretexts, and she had even lost her temper over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a mocking voice rang out from across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't this the guy who got dumped by Sophia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall woman with dark sunglasses sashayed over. She was wearing a white blouse, a black blazer, a fitted pencil skirt, and black stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Karen Jones, Sophia's aunt and the deputy manager of the HR department at Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 38, she was unmarried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was stunningly beautiful, with flawless skin and a unique aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was perfect and incredibly sexy, accentuated by her uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always looked down on Brian's background and constantly belittled and made things difficult for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she found out that Sophia had divorced Brian, she had gloated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen had no idea that Brian was the boss of Transcendent Construction Group or that he had become a partner at Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought he was here to apply for a job, as the company was hiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen took off her sunglasses, revealing her elegant face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Brian with contempt and said, "Brian, after getting kicked out, you couldn't make it on the outside, so you've come to our company to look for a job, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist interjected hesitantly, "Ms. Jones, this gentleman isn't here for a job. He's here to discuss business with Ms. Jenkins. He also mentioned that Ms. Jenkins invited him to dinner tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's scorn and disdain only grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is a loser. Why would Ms. Jenkins do business with him or invite him to dinner? Don't be ridiculous! Only someone as naive as you would believe his nonsense. You can go back to your work. I'll handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Ms. Jones!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dismissing the receptionist, Karen looked at Brian with a teasing expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, it's not easy to find a job these days. For a good-for-nothing like you, it's even harder. Considering you're Sophia's ex, I might be able to find you a job if you beg me. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched casually, revealing her perfect curves. Her ample bosom seemed about to burst out of her blouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the gap between the buttons, Brian could clearly see her smooth skin, which was truly tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked down at him and continued, "I'm the deputy manager of the HR department. You should know it's not a big deal for me to do this!"</span></p></div>
