        <h1>Chapter 112 One Against a Hundred</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden sound startled everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under everyone's fearful gaze, a brown-haired rich guy came over with a group of bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Eleanor's boyfriend, Patrick from the Paul Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're finally here. They beat me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Patrick, Eleanor could no longer suppress the grievance in her heart and threw herself into his arms, crying sadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, don't cry. I will make them pay the price for the insult you suffered today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Patrick looked at Eleanor's tear-streaked face, his eyes were filled with rage. He hurriedly calmed her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then his cold gaze fell on Brian and Celeste, with undisguised murderous intent in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man who cared a lot about his reputation. Now his girlfriend got beaten in public in the mall. If he couldn't seek justice for her, it would be a joke if it got out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he would no longer have the dignity to gain a foothold in his social circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "You got balls. You even dared to hit my girlfriend. Tell me how you want to solve this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian and Celeste smiled at each other and looked at Patrick with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the sake of the Paul Group, we won't make things difficult for you. If you kneel and apologize to us on behalf of your girlfriend, we will let it go. How about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words came out, there was an uproar at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one thought that Brian would ask Patrick to kneel and apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was Paul Smith's son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't understand where Brian got the confidence from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's face was also full of astonishment, and he froze on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy actually asked him to kneel and apologize to them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even wondered if he had heard it wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Brian with a cold gaze and asked sternly, "What did you just say? Say it again if you have guts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said if you kneel and apologize for your girlfriend, we'll let it go. What? Is there a problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there a problem? Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick couldn't help laughing wildly as if he had heard a big joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I've seen crazy people, but I've never seen one as crazy as you! I've given you a chance. Since you don't want to cherish it, then you can't blame me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he said with a cold face, "Go ahead. Chop this guy up and throw him to the dogs! This woman is pretty good-looking. Sell her to the club as a prostitute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his order, the group of bodyguards following him pounced on Brian and Celeste like wild wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes flashed with cold light. She was about to take action but was stopped by Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave the fight to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he said that, Brian's energy surged, and he rushed out like a flash of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards who rushed over felt a flash before their eyes. Before they could see Brian's movements clearly, they were hit by a powerful force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they were horrified to find that their bodies were completely out of control and flew out like cannonballs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few seconds, all of Patrick's bodyguards were knocked to the ground by Brian, lying on the ground wailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they didn't even get to touch Brian's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's powerful skills shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many passing socialite girls looked at him with admiration and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste also had a touching smile on her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time she saw Brian fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smooth movements and skills were somewhat beyond her expectations. A flash of admiration flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian at this moment was in sharp contrast to the image of being beaten up when they first met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In just over a month, he has completely changed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's eyes widened, looking at Brian in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Isn't he a loser? How can he be so good at fighting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick looked grim, staring at Brian. He gritted his teeth and said, "No wonder you dare to be so arrogant. It turns out you are something. But I am not an ordinary man. Today I will show you my power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Patrick swung his fist at Brian.</span></p></div>
