        <h1>Chapter 135 Lord of Wealth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria narrowed her eyes. "Is there any problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary gave a bitter smile. "Trillion Group is on the verge of bankruptcy. Even if you take out two billion dollars to help Brian, it won't help much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, once Tanner knows this, he will report you to the board of directors. At that time, not only will you be removed from the position of president, but you will also be detained for the embezzling company's funds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was calm. "Given Trillion Group's current situation, if I ask Brian for money like those people, it would be like kicking him when he is down. It's simply impossible to get that money back. In that case, Tanner will still report me to the board of directors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I use this money to help Brian, it will be like providing timely help in his difficult situation. If he can get through this crisis, Queen's Construction Group will become Trillion Group's most important partner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary's bitter smile grew stronger. "But what if Brian fails?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the secretary still wanted to say something, Aria smiled, "At worst, I'll spend a few years in prison." She was confident in her ability to judge people, and she believed that Brian could keep Trillion Group and get through this difficult time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria said, "Come on. Let's go visit Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 2 p.m., the sun was shining brightly. In the garden of Riverside Villa No. 9, there were birds singing and flowers blooming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was lying on a sun lounger, enjoying the sun, having a shoulder massage by Zoe, and having coffee. He didn't feel worried about Trillion Group's situation or the rumors on the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Velmara, the Lord of Wealth, one of the Four Lords of the War Deities, had already arrived in Riverwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sound of footsteps, Sam respectfully led a girl over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl had a sweet and lovely appearance, with two cute pigtails. She wore a white princess dress. Although she was only about five feet tall, her figure was extremely hot, especially her plump breasts seemed to burst her clothes at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked, her breasts jiggled, looking cute and alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Velmara, the Lord of Wealth, one of the Four Lords of the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian, Velmara was very happy. Her delicate and lovely face beamed a bright smile. She opened her arms and threw herself into Brian's arms. "Master, I miss you so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was half-lying on the chair, and with Velmara's action, his face was buried in her buxom chest. His nose immediately filled with the alluring scent of a young girl's body, and the softness on his cheeks made his breathing rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to speak, Velmara grabbed his collar with both hands and shook him violently. "Master, you left me behind without saying anything. Be honest, do you dislike me? Master, say something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt dizzy, and his face would occasionally bump into Velmara's soft and plump breasts. It made him feel dazed, and he didn't have the strength to speak at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After not seeing Velmara for a few years, she was still as violent as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Zoe was helpless. She reminded kindly, "Stop, Velmara. Master is almost dizzy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Velmara dared to question Brian like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Velmara realized her impoliteness and quickly let go of Brian. She lowered her head, blushed, and stood aside respectfully, looking like a child who had made a mistake. "Master, I'm sorry. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Velmara could finish her words, Brian stroked her head indulgently and said, "After all these years, you haven't changed at all. Didn't I tell you to be more gentle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara replied in a low voice, "I... I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if she had thought of something, she stared at Brian with her big eyes. "Master, I heard from Zoe that you're in urgent need of money now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded. "I took over a company, and I'm having trouble with funds now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara gave a charming smile, took out a bank card, and handed it to Brian. "Master, there's ten billion dollars in this card. It's yours now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten billion dollars?" Sam and Zoe were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was also stunned. He didn't expect Velmara to be so generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara thought Brian felt that ten billion dollars wasn't enough, and she then took a stack of bank cards from her pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "What? Is the money not enough? I have more cards here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Sam and Zoe looked astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian knew that Velmara managed all the assets of the War Deities, but he didn't expect that she could come out with ten billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, judging by her expression, ten billion dollars was like pocket change to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Brian was the Master of the War Deities, he had never paid attention to how much money the War Deities had because he wasn't interested in money at all. Money was just like a cold number to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian liked to be together with the members of the War Deities, freely enjoying a happy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he wanted to gather all the former members, who had shared weal and woe, recreate their former glory, and lead them to the best life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took out a dragon-patterned token and threw it into Velmara's hand. "Lord of Wealth, listen to my order. I want you to do everything possible to recall all the scattered members of the War Deities and rebuild the War Deities in Riverwood at all costs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara knelt on one knee, placed her right hand on her chest, and said with an extremely pious expression, "Yes, Master!"</span></p></div>
