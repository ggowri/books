        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, the turmoil at the Trillion Group finally gradually subsided. The previously plummeting stock price finally stabilized, but the company's market value, which was originally in the hundreds of billions of dollars, had now dropped to less than forty billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be a long time before the Trillion Group returned to its original state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Thomas taking away the core team of the Trillion Group had a significant impact on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Brian wasn't worried about this at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to, he could raise the Trillion Group's stock price at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't want to expose his trump cards too soon. After all, the other heirs of the Godfather were all very smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the War Deities were reorganized, Brian didn't want to attract their attention too early and planned to take this time to develop himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To express his gratitude to Anastasia for her support, Brian specially cooked a sumptuous meal and invited her to taste it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It smells so good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Anastasia entered the door, she smelled the alluring aroma of the food, and her appetite was whetted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, she had no appetite for anything and had been looking forward to tasting Brian's cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had successfully won her heart with his culinary skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, what dishes have you made today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't wait to walk to the dining table and was excited to see the delicious food on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled and introduced the dishes to her, "Smoked Salmon, Grilled Tuna Steak, Gratinated Lobster in Mornay Sauce, T-Bone Steak, Smoked Spare Ribs with Honey, Gratinated Mussels Hollandaise Sauce, Mango Sherbets, and a bottle of 1990 vintage red wine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Brian's introduction, Anastasia couldn't wait to give them a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sit down and taste them," Seeing her eager look, Brian smiled and pulled out a chair for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to start eating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she sat down, Anastasia couldn't help but pick up a fork and start tasting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking the first bite, she couldn't help but let out a satisfied and enjoyable sigh, "My god, this is so delicious. Brian, you're the best chef in the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Anastasia was dressed very beautifully. Her wavy hair was coiled up high, revealing her delicate and flawless cheeks. She wore a heart-shaped diamond necklace around her neck, paired with a strapless, low-cut white dress, looking noble yet sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a fairy coming to the world to taste delicious food, stunning Brian with her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's cheeks were already charming, and her lips were so sexy that Brian felt a strong impulse to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Brian's intense gaze, Anastasia blushed and pretended to be puzzled as she asked, "Brian, why are you staring at me? Why aren't you eating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so beautiful that I've lost interest in food. I just want to taste..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian seemed to realize his gaffe and didn't finish his sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia looked up at him in confusion and asked, "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing. The food today..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian tried to change the subject, but Anastasia interrupted him, "What do you want to taste? Maybe I'll satisfy you if you tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and playfully winked at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian asked in a low voice, "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded with a smile and said, "Of course! I never break my promise! What do you want to taste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist Anastasia's temptation after all, Brian hesitated for a moment and then said in a low voice, "You."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, Anastasia blushed shyly, looking alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she playfully glared at Brian and said, "No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't expect Anastasia to go back on her word and said, "You just promised me, and you also said you never broke your promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I changed my mind!" Anastasia proudly raised her head and playfully winked at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was stunned and speechless, not expecting to be fooled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe you tricked me. I'm so sad..." Brian pretended to be disappointed, sighed, and hung his head, looking dejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time Anastasia had seen Brian so dejected. She leaned over the table and curiously looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "You're not really that petty and actually angry, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised his head and was about to speak when his lips touched Anastasia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both widened their eyes and froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft touch made Brian breathe rapidly and get excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively held Anastasia's lips in his mouth, sucking.</span></p></div>
