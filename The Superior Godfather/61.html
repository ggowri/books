        <h1>Chapter 61 Shareholders Shocked</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the chairman we are waiting for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Are you kidding me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric couldn't help laughing as if he had heard a huge joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian also had a look of mockery and amusement on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "This kid is really good at bragging!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sneer appeared on Thomas' lips at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was anxious about how to confront Celeste, not anticipating that her attractive companion would show up and create trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Celeste clarifying her relationship with Brian at the investment promotion conference, many still viewed their connection as questionable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many believed Brian's partnership with Trillion Group was solely due to Celeste's manipulation of the chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Thomas gave Eric a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric understood instantly and suddenly fixed his gaze on Celeste and asked sternly, "Celeste, your man is really brave. How dare he pretend to be our chairman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if it reaches the actual chairman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste raised her red lips slightly, and a playful smile appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched out her slender hands and admired the freshly done manicure with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "What will be the consequences? I don't know. Why don't you call the chairman and ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being looked down upon by Celeste, Eric was so angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Do you think I don't dare to call? If you have the guts, give me the chairman's phone number."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled slightly and handed the phone over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric opened the call record and dialed the phone number marked "Mr. Edwards".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the cell phone in Brian's pocket rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden ring startled everyone at the scene, and they all looked at Brian in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was clearly calling the chairman, but why was Brian's phone ringing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas raised his eyebrows and narrowed his eyes. "Could this be a coincidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian also frowned at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric didn't notice these but waited for the call to be connected and then spoke quickly, "Mr. Edwards, when will you arrive at the company? Celeste brought a man who is pretending to be you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized something was wrong before he could finish his words and stood in a daze because Brian pressed the speakerphone button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice came out clearly from the phone, echoing in everyone's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he really the mysterious chairman of our company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian holding the cell phone and looking calm, people at the scene were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas narrowed his eyes slightly, and his expression became more solemn than ever before at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If he is the new chairman, then his methods and schemes are too scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, the investment promotion conference became a big drama directed and performed by him and a means to reorganize the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Celeste alone would not have the courage to touch Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there's one thing I can't figure out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Brian is the new chairman of the company, what's the point of letting the Transcendent Construction Group he founded become a partner of Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frozen in disbelief, Eric confronted Brian, murmuring, "You...you are Mr. Edwards, the new chairman of the company Celeste mentioned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian casually played with his phone, enjoying the moment. "What? Is there a problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible! You are the boss of Transcendent Construction Group. How can you suddenly become the new chairman of the company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric shook his head, unable to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fake. All this is fake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must be a show directed and performed by you and Celeste to deceive and fool us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Brian to answer, Eric continued, "A real chairman would never be so bored as to start a new construction company and then do something stupid like handing over the Weston project of Trillion Group to this shell company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone at the scene echoed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. If he's really the chairman, he would not do that. It doesn't make sense at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy must be fake. He teamed up with Celeste to deceive us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and Damian stared at Celeste and Brian with serious eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste sneered and threw a document directly from the drawer in front of Eric and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Do I have nothing better to do than lie to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the company's equity transfer document. Please open your eyes and read it carefully to see if Brian is the new chairman of the company?"</span></p></div>
