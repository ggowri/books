        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a waste of my time. This guy's getting on my nerves," Kevin sneered with a cold smirk, a hint of mockery flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to him? Celeste, who do you think you are?" he spat out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could speak, Kevin continued, "You're defending this guy so much? What is he, your boy toy? Let me tell you! Even if he is your sugar baby, he'll never become our company's business partner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, get the hell out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know who he is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face darkened with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like I care who he is!" Kevin snapped impatiently. "If you've got nothing else to say, just get lost. Don't mess with my good time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his uncle backing him up, he had become incredibly arrogant at the company and showed no respect for Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Celeste's powerful connections, he would have already dragged her to bed and taught her a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Celeste tried to say more, Brian held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed Kevin with an icy stare and said coldly, "Don't worry, we'll leave. But first, there's something I need to take care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin asked with a puzzled look, "What thing are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian flashed a wicked grin. "This thing... beating the crap out of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he slammed his fist into Kevin's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin let out a pig-like squeal, his face swelling like a balloon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched his bruised, swollen face and glared at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, how dare you hit..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian slapped him across the face with a loud crack before he could finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's right cheek swelled immediately, showing a clear handprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian landed several more slaps across his face before he could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking more than ten slaps, Kevin finally came to his senses. He lunged at Brian with a twisted expression, ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bam!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes turned cold as he kicked Kevin's beer belly, sending him flying back into the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kevin writhed in pain and tried to get up, Brian grabbed the ashtray from the desk and smashed it against his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ashtray shattered, splitting Kevin's head open. Blood gushed out, quickly staining his clothes red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Security! Security!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene sent the beautiful assistant and secretary screaming as they frantically called for security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, a swarm of security guards burst in wielding batons, looking ready for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked when they saw Kevin's miserable condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe someone had dared to beat Kevin up like this and quickly rushed over to help him up from the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, are you alright? Mr. Wright..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's face twisted in pain from his throbbing head as he glared at Brian with eyes full of madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little punk, I swear I'll tear you to pieces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all standing around for? Teach this bastard a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, the security guards' faces turned cold as they charged forward, swinging their batons at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Celeste's eyes flashed with anger as she shouted, "Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms... Ms. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards finally noticed Celeste standing nearby and quickly halted their actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards is my honored guest. Who dares to touch him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards hesitated, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Kevin erupted like an enraged lion, his eyes blazing red with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you idiots standing around for? I told you to take this bastard down!" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards looked uncertainly between Celeste and Kevin, none making a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were caught between the company president and vice president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither was someone they could afford to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if they had to pick sides, they'd stand with Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Kevin had always treated them like dirt, thrown his weight around, and acted like a tyrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless dogs! What am I paying you for?" Kevin snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm counting to three! If you don't take this piece of trash out, you're all fired!" he screamed, ultimately losing his cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after glancing at Celeste, the security guards still held back from confronting Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was so furious he could taste blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian quickly grabbed him by the collar before he could say more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You son of a bitch, it's time we settled our scores."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his mouth, he slapped Kevin hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he dragged Kevin to the window with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what are you doing? Let me go... damn it, let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin struggled in panic, his face filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice cut off abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had dangled him outside the window, suspended mid-air from the 56th floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one release of Brian's grip, Kevin would plummet down, his body shattering on impact.</span></p></div>
