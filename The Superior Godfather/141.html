        <h1>Chapter 141 She Was Crazy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria gave Brian a resentful look, stroked her hair, and pointed at Ted, Galen, and the others, saying, "Mr. Edwards, do you think I'm the same kind of person as these shortsighted guys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was confused. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria smiled, without explaining, and just clapped her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's secretary then respectfully handed a bank card to Brian and said, "Mr. Edwards, after learning about your company's difficulties, Ms. Jenkins raised two billion dollars overnight, hoping to help you get through this difficult time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room was shocked. They looked at Aria in disbelief, thinking she was crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria didn't terminate the contract or demand the cooperation project payment. Instead, she took out two billion dollars to help Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew what Aria meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had deceived Aria with Transcendent Construction Group, a shell company. Besides, after Queen's Construction Group undertook the development project in Weston, it had advanced a large sum of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted, Galen, Celeste, and Damian were stunned by Aria's action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Zoe and Sam smiled, and they looked at Aria in admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It required not only insight but also great courage for Aria to make such a choice at this critical time. Once her decision was wrong, she would face unprecedented risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was shocked, looking at Aria. "Ms. Jenkins, do you know what you're doing? Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria gave a charming smile and winked at him. "Mr. Edwards, do I look like I'm kidding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you know there are..." Brian was about to say something but was interrupted by Aria, "I'm very clear about the consequences of doing this, but this is my choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked puzzled. "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others also looked at Aria in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria smiled brightly, looking very charming. "It's just my choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't understand. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked stunned and confused, thinking Aria was a love-struck person. She liked Brian and helped him without reservation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this possibility, these people shook their heads and looked at Aria with pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, they felt full of sympathy for the shareholders of Queen's Construction Group. If those guys knew about Aria's decision, they would probably be pissed off. In their view, Aria was using their money to help the man she liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people present seemed to have already heard the shareholders of Queen's Construction Group swearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared blankly at Aria, not expecting her to give such an answer. He thought, "She is extraordinary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Okay, I accept your kindness. Take a seat over there. After I deal with the current matter, we can have a good chat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria nodded gently and sat down with her secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all sure that you came here specifically to terminate the cooperation and settle the cooperation payment?" Brian turned to look at Galen, Ted, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Do you think we're here to fool around?" Before Brian could respond, Ted and Galen continued, "Or do you think you can intimidate us by using Dyer as a warning? We're not afraid of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, dozens of bodyguards Ted and Galen brought, stood out in unison and exuded a powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other people present echoed, "We're not afraid of you, Brian. If you can't come up with the money today, we won't let you leave here alive." They stood up with their bodyguards. Obviously, they all came prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold light flashed in Raven's eyes, and he suddenly raised the big hammer in his hand. "Damn it! You want to attack Mr. Edwards? Come one! Let me see your means!" He was eager to take this opportunity to show off in front of Zoe and Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Raven was about to take action, Zoe said coldly, "Raven, we're here with Mr. Edwards to solve the problem, not to fight. Step back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Guzman!" Raven paused, scratched his head awkwardly, and respectfully stepped aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raven? Ms. Guzman?" This scene stunned everyone present. They murmured, and their expressions changed. Their gazes toward Raven and Zoe filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone asked, "Are you Raven from Shadow Fang? Is she Zoe Guzman, the head of Shadow Fang?"</span></p></div>
