        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this be? Is he really the new chairman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the contents of the document, Eric was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It clearly stated that the former top shareholder had transferred all shares to Brian, making him the chairman of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see that!" Thomas' face darkened, and he had a bad feeling in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished reading the document, his expression also looked particularly gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's expression turned uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for other shareholders and senior executives, they were all shocked and looked at Brian in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had followed Eric to question and ridicule Brian before began to sweat coldly on their foreheads, worrying that their positions would be lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never expected that the new chairman would meet them in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste quickly approached Brian and bowed, greeting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others, regaining their composure, followed suit, even Damian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Thomas and Eric remained seated in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thomas!" Eric, looking troubled, turned to Thomas, whose expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he had figured something out, Thomas smiled and walked quickly towards Brian, extending his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard the last chairman secretly transferred his shares and wondered who it was. It turns out to be you, Mr. Edwards. You're really a genius. I've heard a lot about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, who is this?" Brian asked, raising an eyebrow in suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, this is Mr. Thomas Lee, the second largest shareholder of the company," Celeste introduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes narrowed slightly as he shook Thomas' hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're the second largest shareholder, Mr. Thomas Lee. I've heard much about you," Brian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' nephew Kevin was put into prison by him, but he was still able to greet him with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was enough to show Thomas was a very cunning person and was not ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief exchange, Thomas turned to Eric, who was speechless, and snapped, "Eric, you blind man, what are you doing standing there? Come over here and apologize to Mr. Edwards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrified, Eric stood and bowed to Brian. "Mr. Edwards, I didn't know your identity. I apologize for my offense. I hope you can forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, smiling kindly, placed a hand on Eric's shoulder. "Mr. Eric Lee, I admire your courage in pursuing the truth for the company's benefit! I won't punish you. I should promote you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Brian not only not to bother with him but also to praise him in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he thought he was in the clear, Brian continued, "Celeste mentioned the publicity department needs a director. Why don't you take charge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the director position sounded prestigious and was one level higher than his current position as general manager of the Marketing Department, it held no real power and was effectively a dead-end role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was marginalizing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards," Eric began to protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brian interrupted, insisting, "Mr. Eric Lee, accept the promotion. The publicity department is crucial, and the director position is yours. Mr. Thomas Lee, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian shot Thomas a commanding look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Thomas remained outwardly calm, he seethed inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, he asked Eric to apologize because he wanted Brian to let the matter go and not bother with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, Brian not only praised Eric but also promoted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This disguised form of promotion was so flawless that he was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he knew that Brian was warning others and was using the incident with Eric to test him, he could only cooperate now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he could only pat Eric's shoulder to comfort him. "Eric, Mr. Edwards is right. The publicity department is vital. Accepting this role shows your trustworthiness. Don't disappoint Mr. Edwards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric felt as if he had been struck by lightning, his face growing even paler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected Thomas to abandon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding shareholders and executives regarded Brian with a mix of gravity and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were amazed by the new chairman's ability to control both Thomas and Eric effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian narrowed his eyes, his expression growing serious as he muttered, "This new chairman is not simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes flashed with surprise as she observed Brian's brilliant tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had deftly diminished Eric's position and indirectly reprimanded Thomas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was both surprised and impressed by Brian's skillful maneuvering.</span></p></div>
