        <h1>Chapter 108 Welcome to See Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this agreement, Brian quickly got into work mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me. How is the company doing recently? Has anything big happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste pondered for a moment and said, "After the last shareholders' meeting, the company has been completely stable, and nothing big has happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just that I heard that Thomas and Eric are contacting shareholders and senior executives privately recently, and they seem to be preparing for some big moves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Brian narrowed his eyes slightly, and a hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that the lesson I gave them last time was far from enough. This time, I wonder what tricks they want to play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his phone and made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brian hung up the phone, Celeste couldn't help but ask curiously, "Who did you call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't tell her directly but smiled and replied, "You'll know in a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than ten minutes later, a middle-aged man with a big belly in a suit with suspenders rushed to Brian's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Phillips?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing who it was, Celeste was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect Brian to call Damian, the third largest shareholder of the Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among all the shareholders of the Trillion Group, Damian and Thomas were the most arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had to invite them in person for every meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect him to come over after Brian called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian smiled and greeted Brian and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded slightly and went straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Phillips, I heard that Thomas and Eric have been contacting the company's shareholders and executives privately recently to make some big moves. Do you know about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the last shareholders' meeting, Damian had already been impressed by Brian's methods and felt that he would achieve great things in the future. So he chose Brian without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a deep voice, "Mr. Edwards, to be honest, this is true. And Thomas has also invited all the shareholders and executives to meet at Paradise Hotel at 8 o'clock tonight, saying that he wants to give us a chance to rise to prominence. And most of us have agreed to attend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Celeste was slightly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the president of the Trillion Group, she didn't know about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Damian calmly. "Mr. Phillips, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian quickly expressed his attitude. "Mr. Edwards, I am definitely on your side. Of course, I can't attend this kind of meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took a sip of wine elegantly and said lightly, "No, you must go. I'm counting on you to help me find out the news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian was slightly startled, hesitated for a moment, and said, "Mr. Edwards, since you said so, I'll go check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Go get ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian waved his hand lightly, and Damian left respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he left, Celeste couldn't help asking, "Aren't you afraid that Thomas will really do something and persuade Damian to join forces with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian sneered and said indifferently, "What can they do? It's nothing more than withdrawing investment, resigning, and other old-fashioned methods. To be honest, I really hope they do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste wanted to say something but was interrupted by Brian's wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, how is the subsidiary I asked you to create going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste replied, "The subsidiary has been successfully created. At present, it has more than 300 employees on the job. As for the three beauty products you mentioned, they are also being developed intensively. Samples can be produced in three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded slightly and said seriously, "You are very efficient. Once the samples come out and I confirm them, they will be fully mass-produced and announced. This must be carried out in secret. The faster the better. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Brian's serious look, Celeste smiled and murmured in her heart, "I didn't expect this guy to be so handsome when he's working."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian got up, yawned, stretched, and walked towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then do your work. I have to take a nap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slept too late with Zoe last night, and he had to replenish his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian being lazy again, Celeste was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was really handsome for only three seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To motivate Brian to go to the office, she thought about it and said playfully, "Mr. Edwards, I've made up my mind! From now on, I will wear a different color and style of stockings every day when I go to the company. Mr. Edwards, welcome to see me on time every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Brian's response, Celeste turned around, her long, straight legs striding confidently, swaying her sexy waist as she prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wear a different color and style of stockings every day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Celeste's words and imagining her beautiful legs in stockings, Brian couldn't help but swallow hard and instinctively asked, "So what color and style of stockings do you plan to wear today?"</span></p></div>
