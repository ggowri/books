        <h1>Chapter 50 Herbert's Shock</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The treatment was completed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian reluctantly pulled his hand away from Eliza's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you feeling now, Ms. Gray?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza stretched casually, revealing her perfect figure. She smiled, "I feel great. Thank you, Mr. Edwards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian flashed a casual smile and led her out of the guest room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you doing, Eliza?" Anastasia asked, looking up from the TV where she was sitting on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza replied with a smile, "Ms. Vaughn, thank you for your concern. After Mr. Edwards' treatment, I'm almost fully recovered. His elemental energy is truly amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Eliza's praise for Brian, Anastasia felt an inexplicable sense of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Brian was the man she loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two rest for a bit. I'll get dinner started."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian tied on an apron and headed into the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza couldn't help but ask curiously, "Ms. Vaughn, does Brian really know how to cook?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded with a smile. "Absolutely. And his food is even better than what you'd get from a five-star hotel chef. You're in for a treat today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza looked surprised, her eyes filled with doubt. "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled enigmatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to eat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Brian emerged from the kitchen carrying a tray of delicious dishes, filling the dining table with an array of mouth-watering meals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were foie gras, prawns, spicy roast chicken, prime ribs, and pork chops...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aroma of spicy and savory flavors filled the dining room, making Eliza's appetite soar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, that smells amazing! Brian, you're incredible! Did you make all this by yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza looked at the table in awe, her mouth watering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, however, picked up her fork and said calmly, "This is just his basic skill. Go ahead. Taste it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She encouraged Eliza to try a piece of the spicy roasted chicken first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza took a bite, savoring the flavors curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, she let out a satisfied gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! This is so delicious! I love the spiciness and the tenderness of the chicken. I can't stop eating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza went on to try the other dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she finally understood why Anastasia had come here to enjoy a meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's cooking was really exceptional!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Eliza's ravenous expression, Anastasia chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she picked up her fork and began to eat as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, she let out a contented sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's dishes were as delicious as ever, whetting her appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since many of the dishes were spicy, they both started to sweat. They even unbuttoned their clothes a bit, revealing large areas of enticing skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight made Brian's mouth go dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that was so satisfying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Eliza and Anastasia finally finished all the delicious food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They slumped back in their chairs, their beautiful faces filled with contentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza looked at Brian admiringly and said, "Brian, you are by far the best chef I've ever met!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt proud of the high praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied with a smile, "Thank you. It's an honor to receive such a compliment from you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza's phone rang just as she was about to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vaughn, it's a call from your father," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia said casually, "Go ahead and answer it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza nodded slightly and stepped out onto the balcony to take the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert's voice came through the phone, authoritative and oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliza, how did it go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza replied respectfully, "Mr. Vaughn, I've tested Brian as you instructed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbert asked gruffly, "Did he withstand how many of your moves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza's face turned red with embarrassment. She hesitated for a moment and whispered, "Four."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four? So Brian is indeed a useless guy. Tell Anastasia to come back right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza quickly said, "Mr. Vaughn, you've got it all wrong! I mean I failed to last four moves against him... And he even let me have three more moves first. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to withstand even one of his moves."</span></p></div>
