        <h1>Chapter 142 Regretted</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven carried a big hammer, looking rather disgruntled. "What? Is there any problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, these people couldn't help but widen their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted and Galen's expressions changed drastically. They never expected that Brian would have dealings with Shadow Fang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Raven and Zoe's attitudes towards Brian were truly respectful. There was awe and fanaticism in their eyes when they looked at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone thought, "Damn it! Who on earth is Brian's real identity? Isn't it said that he is just a commoner from the bottom of society?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at each other and saw fear and confusion in each other's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian and Celeste were extremely shocked. They never expected that Brian would know Zoe and Zoe's relationship with Brian was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria and her secretary were full of astonishment. It seemed that Brian's identity was not as simple as what Thomas and the others had exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing everyone's surprised expressions, Brian couldn't help but smile. He extended his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe quickly and respectfully handed a glass of red wine to his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian sipped the red wine while looking at Ted, Galen, and the others. "You all seem to be planning to attack me, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh... Mr. Edwards, you've misunderstood. We dare not do that at all. These guys are impulsive." Ted and Galen smiled obsequiously, and then angrily shouted at the bodyguards behind them, "What are you standing here for? Step back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the bodyguards they brought were well-trained, they would never match Raven's group of ruthless gangsters who could kill people without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ted and Galen angered these guys, they might be assassinated in their houses. After all, these people were cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said, "You just said that I was using Dyer to warn you. You're wrong. I don't need to do that when I want to deal with you. I just want to tell you that there will be a price to pay for causing trouble in Trillion Group. That's all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving everyone a warning, Brian looked at Ted and asked, "How much money does my company owe your bank?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted replied, "4.5 billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked indifferent as he gave an order to Celeste. "Celeste, transfer the money to him. By the way, send out a notice that from now on, the company will stop all business dealings with Riverwood Bank, and all the company's funds are not allowed to go through the bank in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Celeste nodded respectfully. After operating on the laptop for a while, she looked up at Ted and said, "Mr. Weber, the money has been transferred to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted took out his phone and looked at the notification with wide eyes. His expression was exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ted murmured, "No... Didn't the rumor say that Trillion Group's capital chain was broken and there was a deficit in the account? How could it suddenly repay the debt of 4.5 billion dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian ignored Ted, who was looking shocked, and turned to look at Galen. "Celeste, how much project payment does the company owe his company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste replied, "The construction project contracted by Hastings Construction Group is worth five billion dollars. Currently, only 60% of the construction has been completed. After deducting the liquidated damages, it is 2.5386 billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had a cold face as he said, "Settle the payment for him and re-inspect their past cooperation projects. If they are not up to standard, pursue all the legal responsibilities and compensation. By the way, use the Trillion Group's influence to impose an industry-wide ban on Hastings Construction Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian would not show mercy to someone like Galen, who acted ungratefully and added insult to injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Celeste nodded and soon transferred the project payment to Galen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the money that had arrived in his account, Galen, like Ted, was extremely shocked. Thinking of Brian's words, he was afraid, and his face turned even paler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Trillion Group imposed a ban on Hastings Construction Group and re-inspected the past cooperation projects, it would be a disaster for Galen. After all, in the construction industry, not each project followed the requirement strictly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be good if Trillion Group went bankrupt. Otherwise, what awaited Galen would be a disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gave Galen a cold look and asked Celeste to cancel the contracts and settle the payments with the other cooperation parties one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short time, Brian repaid billions of dollars in debt and settled all the cooperation payments with everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was no joy on the faces of those people who received the money. Instead, there was unprecedented shock and deep regret in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suddenly realized that Thomas and the others' withdrawal of investment had not caused irreparable damage to Trillion Group. Trillion Group's capital chain was not broken at all, and its working capital was still very substantial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Brian had just received 100 billion dollars from Velmara. With the support of such a large amount of funds, it was simply impossible for the entire Trillion Group to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The behavior of those people demanding to terminate the cooperation agreement with Trillion Group was simply stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their unilateral termination of the cooperation with Trillion Group was a breach of contract, and they had to pay liquidated damages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It caused them certain losses and made them lose Trillion Group, the most powerful business partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, everyone deeply regretted their actions, and some people even knelt and apologized to Brian. "Mr. Edwards, I was wrong. I shouldn't have believed the slander. Please give me another chance to cooperate."</span></p></div>
