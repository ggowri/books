        <h1>Chapter 7 Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian narrowed his eyes.</span><br><span>I had no idea Ryan had those kinds of connections. No wonder he's feeling so invincible. But times have changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They have no clue I'm now running Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even vice president Kevin will have to address me respectfully as "Mr. Edwards" from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll see what I can do before long," Brian added, a confident smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold glance at the others, Brian strode toward the exit of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Sophia and the others thought he had left to simmer down, he burst back in, two buckets of oil in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he popped open the barrels and began drenching the entire villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! This maniac's going to torch the place!" Sophia screamed, eyes wide with panic as the group scrambled for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression was unfazed as he tossed a lighter into the oil-soaked room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already lost their belongings and memories; now he was turning their precious villa into ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was only the beginning of his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the upcoming Trillion Group investment conference, he would make Ryan and Sophia feel the sting of true despair and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathless and covered in soot, Ryan, Sophia, Anne, Robert, and Mary finally made it out of the inferno, each looking like they'd just crawled out of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood aghast, staring at the villa engulfed in flames, watching Brian's figure fade into the distance, their faces a mask of barely contained rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's expression darkened, her teeth clenched in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard just burned our villa to the ground! Looks like we've been too soft on him! I want you to find someone to take care of that scum right now. I want him gone from this world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider it done. I'll call in the local gang, Shadow Fang, and have them slice him up for the dogs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's eyes flared with a murderous determination as he pulled out his phone without a moment's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Anastasia sat in her Rolls Royce, a smirk dancing on her lips as she watched the villa go up in flames, sipping her red wine with a sense of satisfaction. She said, "Now this is getting interesting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kale, if my memory serves me right, you said Brian was back to smooth things over, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale chuckled, a hint of disbelief in his voice. "I completely misjudged Mr. Edwards. So, Ms. Vaughn, are you still planning to call off your engagement with him today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes sparkled with intrigue as she replied, "I want to explore my options before deciding. You can head back now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Kale departed, Anastasia floored it, steering her car straight toward Brian, who stood waiting by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian caught sight of the approaching vehicle, and as it raced toward him, alert washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is this an assassin sent to finish me off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split-second decision, he leaped onto the car's hood, shattering the reinforced bulletproof glass with a swift kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly climbed into the vehicle, a knife pressed against Anastasia's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who sent you?" Brian demanded, his voice low and menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia paled, fear flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I just wanted to stage a car accident to bump into Brian! Didn't think he'd mistake me for an assassin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But hey, that was kind of cool&mdash;he kicked through that bulletproof glass like it was made of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But... didn't he lose his energy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a whirlwind of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the icy determination in Brian's eyes, Anastasia hastily raised her hands in surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, you've got it all wrong. My driver had an unexpected emergency, so I had to drive myself. Unfortunately, I'm not very skilled behind the wheel, and the car got out of control and crashed into you. I sincerely apologize for the trouble and am more than willing to make it right. Please forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian listened to Anastasia's explanation, he couldn't help but notice her angelic appearance and elegant attire. He furrowed his brow, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't strike him as an assassin at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she resembled a high-powered CEO, beautiful and poised, with a cold yet sexy allure that was undeniably captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Real assassins carried a certain coldness, a menacing air about them. Even the best at disguising it couldn't hide the cues he had learned to spot easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that I've jumped to conclusions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, he quickly shifted his tone. "I'm sorry, beautiful lady. I think I might have misunderstood everything...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I accidentally damaged your car in my anxiety just now. Let me fix it for you and offer proper compensation. Please, forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was taken aback by his response. A flicker of surprise flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In situations like this, most people would likely take advantage of her, making excessive demands on her as a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Brian, owning up to it like a true gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected humility only piqued her interest in him further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She decided to keep her true identity under wraps and get to know Brian better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a warm smile, she replied, "How could this possibly be your fault? It's entirely because of my poor driving skills that this misunderstanding happened. I should be the one compensating you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anastasia spoke, she pulled out a checkbook and pen, offering them to him. "Just write down whatever amount you think is fair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to see if Brian was easily swayed by money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But faced with such an easy out, Brian simply smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it's just a misunderstanding, there's really no need for compensation. Besides, I'm the one who caused the damage to your car..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's smile broadened, and she extended her hand in greeting. "I'm Rachael Vaughn. It's a pleasure to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vaughn, you're even more beautiful than your name suggests. I'm Brian Edwards!" he replied with a slight smile, taking her hand warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft warmth surged through him at their contact, making his heart race, but Brian pulled away quickly, not wanting to linger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gesture of politeness sparked a flicker of surprise and admiration in Anastasia's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, to make up for the inconvenience, how about I buy you a drink?" she offered, her tone inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!" Brian replied, eager to accept the invitation from this stunning beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They soon arrived at a nearby bar, settling in at a cozy corner table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia ordered a cocktail while Brian opted for a glass of whiskey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her angelic features and alluring figure, Anastasia quickly became the center of attention in the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some patrons gawked at her, eyes filled with lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others whistled, trying to catch her attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a middle-aged bald man adorned with a thick gold chain sauntered over, flanked by two thuggish companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with a sleazy smirk, "Yo, babe! You're a total knockout. You just scream 'up for some wild times'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm full of energy and can really blow your mind. What say you we go get a drink, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald guy, Tyrone Duffy, was eyeing Anastasia like a hungry wolf, his eyes ablaze with lust as he let his lecherous gaze wander all over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sister's husband was Raven Knox, a big-shot in the local and most powerful gang, the Shadow Fang. Riding on Raven's coattails, he'd been a real pain in the neck, causing trouble and harassing both men and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God knew how many women had fallen victim to Tyrone's cruelty and become his playthings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he'd set his sights on Anastasia's beauty and was itching to have some "fun" with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia frowned slightly, a flash of disgust crossing her eyes. But instead of saying a word, she decided to sit back and see how Brian would handle the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was about to speak up when Tyrone slapped his hand on Brian's shoulder, scowling menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your girl's silence means she's on board. I'm sure you wouldn't be a spoilsport, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Tyrone whipped out a dagger and pressed it against Brian's side.</span></p></div>
