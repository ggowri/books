        <h1>Chapter 11 Four Lords and Twelve Blades</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard someone was looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's enchanting voice drifted through the air, sending shivers down everyone's spine. All the men couldn't help but swallow hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was too captivating, too seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia narrowed her eyes slightly, a flicker of astonishment crossing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected the leader of Shadow Fang to be such a stunningly sexy woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression shifted into something unreadable, his gaze toward Zoe filled with complexity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, sensing the oddity, raised an eyebrow. "Do you know her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." Brian nodded lightly, his response terse, not elaborating further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the world's only Warlord, Brian had founded a legendary organization, the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for various reasons, he eventually chose to disband it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had been one of the key members of the War Deities. In fact, she was a small leader under his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Guzman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Guzman, you're finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven and the others were visibly relieved, practically ecstatic at her arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven scrambled towards Zoe, pointing at Brian as he angrily accused him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Guzman, it's this damn bastard here... he not only beat me and my men senseless, but he also made me call you, saying he's going to take you down too..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's eyes locked onto Brian. Her pupils dilated, and for a moment, her face betrayed a mixture of shock and wild joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that, of all places, she'd run into the man she had been thinking about day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This felt like a dream to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years ago, it was Brian who had pulled her from the brink of death, making her one of the War Deities' core members, one of the Four Lords and Twelve Blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her feelings for Brian were not just gratitude. There was admiration, affection, even devotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, her purpose in life was to serve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Brian, she was willing to give everything, even her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the disbandment of the War Deities, she had been tirelessly searching for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her quest had led her to Riverwood, where she built Shadow Fang, the largest gang in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that she'd reunite with him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stared at his familiar face, the memories of their time together flooded Zoe's mind, bringing a mist to her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven, however, didn't notice Zoe's emotional turmoil. Instead, he arrogantly pointed at Brian, mocking him. "You little shit, weren't you just being all cocky about calling our boss earlier?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that Ms. Guzman is here, you better speak up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you too scared to say anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Raven could finish, Zoe slapped him across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shut the hell up, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Guzman..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven was stunned, clutching his swollen cheek, staring at Zoe in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's eyes grew cold. Without warning, she slapped him again, knocking him dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, to the shock of everyone in the room, Zoe walked up to Brian and knelt on one knee in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire room fell deathly silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood frozen, their eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, the leader of Shadow Fang, was one of the most powerful figures in all of Riverwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a force to be reckoned with, feared by even the government officials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here she was, kneeling before this man, bowing in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left the crowd in stunned silence, unable to comprehend what they were witnessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as though time had frozen, and no one could move or speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrone was completely bewildered. "What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven, his face still swollen, stood rooted to the spot in shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who can tell me what the hell is happening here?" he desperately thought.</span></p></div>
