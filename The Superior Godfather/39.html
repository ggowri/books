        <h1>Chapter 39 The Bet</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transcendent Construction Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin thought his eyes were playing tricks on him. He rubbed them, but the name on the list remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he sealed the envelope yesterday, the list clearly showed the Carter Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Kevin was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands trembled as he held the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's wrong! Mr. Wright doesn't look good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Why does Mr. Wright look so pale?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sure, but something must be wrong. Look, his hands are shaking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd couldn't help but whisper among themselves as they watched Kevin's reaction on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia and Ryan frowned at the scene, and Ryan couldn't help but ask, "Dad, what's happening up there? Kevin doesn't look right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan maintained a calm expression but couldn't shake off a bad feeling in his gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he brushed it off and said dismissively, "What's there to worry about? Kevin's probably just excited and worked up. After all, he put those documents in himself. There's no way there could be a mistake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too excited and worked up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian let out a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys are good at fooling yourselves. Can't you see Kevin standing there frozen because things aren't going according to plan? He doesn't know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan fixed Brian with an icy stare and said with contempt, "Beyond his expectations? Come on, Brian, tell me what could be beyond Kevin's expectations?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian yawned and stretched lazily before responding in a casual tone, "Well, what if the company name on that list isn't your Carter Group but my Transcendent Construction Group instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha... Brian, you're living in a fantasy world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia couldn't help but burst out laughing at Brian's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me you're naive enough to think Trillion Group would be interested in your newly established little company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you something! Trillion Group is extremely strict about choosing and vetting their business partners. Even with Celeste backing you up, you'll never get a partnership deal with Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll only pick Ryan's Carter Group! That's been decided by many senior executives and shareholders within Trillion Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan jumped in with a mocking tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Brian, Kevin is excited about my upcoming success. You should give up on this dream of yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding business owners and elites who were friends with Ryan nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't consider him worth noticing after learning that Brian was Sophia's abandoned ex-husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Carter is right. You're nothing but a worthless reject who got dumped. Thinking you can compete with Mr. Carter? Keep dreaming, loser!" someone sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, kid... you should look in the mirror and see what a nobody you are!" another person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Aria brushed her bangs aside and spoke with a playful tone, "Hold on there, Mr. Carter. You might want to watch what you're saying. Don't forget that Queen's Construction Group is also your competitor. And I've done my homework on Mr. Edwards. His Transcendent Construction Group might be new, but it's already up and running, and he made the shortlist quickly. Well, that says a lot about his capabilities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what they say, don't count your chickens before they hatch! Mr. Carter has Mr. Wright backing him up, but anything could happen until those final results are in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was surprised to see Aria standing up for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aria caught Brian staring, she gave him a charming smile and threw him a playful wink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn, this woman was something else. She was mature and alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt his heart skip a beat and quickly looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The supporters of Ryan and Ethan immediately showed their displeasure at Aria's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul Smith, the owner of the Paul Group, sporting a bald hairstyle, stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're mistaken, Ms. Jenkins. Brian is nothing but a worthless man who lives off women. How could he possibly compete with Mr. Carter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your Queen's Construction Group, I know the Trillion Group won't even consider it. The Carter Group has been a powerhouse in real estate for years. They're the pride of Riverwood and definitely Trillion Group's top choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark Walsh, the owner of Walsh Group, said, "Exactly. Their partnership would be a powerhouse combination. They could turn Weston into the largest commercial center in the southwest region."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria smiled slightly and said casually, "If you're so confident in the Carter Group, why don't we make a bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Mark frowned and asked, "A bet? What kind of bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's red lips curved upward, her smile growing wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's bet 100 million dollars in cash! If the Trillion Group chooses the Carter Group, I'll give each of you 100 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if the Trillion Group chooses Transcendent Construction Group instead, each of you will give me 100 million dollars. How does that sound?"</span></p></div>
