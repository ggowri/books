        <h1>Chapter 31 Begging for Mercy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I was wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I genuinely admit my mistake. Name your terms, just please don't let go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind howled outside as Kevin's face turned ghostly white. He had wet himself in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large, damp stain spread across his pants as he looked at Brian with terror and desperation in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, didn't you want to become Trillion Group's development partner for the Weston project? If you spare me, I can make that happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared at Kevin with a blank expression as he slowly loosened his grip on Kevin's collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do I know you won't lie to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he felt himself slipping, Kevin's soul nearly left his body in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly sputtered, "Mr. Edwards, I won't deceive you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you let me live, I'll convince the higher-ups to support Transcendent Construction Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk played across Brian's lips as he replied, "Those are pretty words, but they're hard to believe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Kevin's face as he desperately pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, we can sign a contract now if you don't trust me. Please give me one chance! I don't want to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll trust you this once," Brian muttered darkly before tossing Kevin back through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin lay gasping for air, his clothes wholly soaked with cold sweat, as if he had been pulled from the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat on the floor, face pale as a sheet, taking deep breaths and gulping down fresh air like it was his lifeline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After shooting a terrified glance at Brian, he quickly turned to his secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get the contract right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, he signed and stamped the contract with trembling hands and then passed it to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, this is the partnership agreement. Once you sign it, you'll be our company's official partner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smart move," Brian said as he picked up the pen and signed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to leave with Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better not try any tricks, or you'll regret it," Brian called over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kevin watched Brian's retreating figure, his eyes burned with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, are you alright? Mr. Wright..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attractive secretary and assistant finally snapped out of their shock and rushed to Kevin's side, dabbing the cold sweat from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin remained silent until Brian and the others left. Then, he viciously tore the signed partnership agreement to shreds while grinding his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you want to be Trillion Group's partner? Keep fucking dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pain shot through his body, making him draw in a sharp breath. He quickly ordered his assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God... get me... get me to the hospital right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Kevin's office, Celeste led Brian to the chairman's office on the 58th floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, my office is next door, and this is your private office..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian sank into the executive chair, nodding with satisfaction as he took in the luxurious and high-tech office while Celeste gave her introduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought crossed his mind, and Brian spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That contract I just signed with Kevin means nothing. It's just to throw Ryan and Sophia off our scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get everything ready, but bypass the executives. We need to catch everyone off guard... got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded. "Don't worry, I'll issue this contract as the company's major shareholder, bypassing all executives... Everyone will think Ryan's Carter Group was chosen as our partner. Only at tomorrow's investment conference will they learn that your Transcendent Construction Group won the project."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was very pleased with Celeste's approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wait to see Ryan's and Sophia's reactions at tomorrow's conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste hesitated before asking, "What are you planning to do with Kevin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scum like him is a cancer to the company," Brian replied without hesitation. "He needs to be eliminated. We'll stick to the original plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded slightly. Kevin's actions today had made her furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like him didn't deserve a place in the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought crossed her mind, and she asked, "Once Transcendent Construction Group becomes our partner and takes charge of the Weston development, what's your plan? You're not going to develop it yourself, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transcendent Construction Group just started up. We don't have that capability. I'll flip it to a bigger company and outsource the development project for a nice profit..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes lit up at Brian's words. "Brilliant!" she thought to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, Brian would make a massive profit while saving on costs and ensuring quality and efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Brian as a frightening thought crossed her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought he had me start the company just to get back at Sophia and Ryan. But now I see this wasn't just about revenge. He planned this all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This level of scheming and planning is terrifying."</span></p></div>
