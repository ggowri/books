        <h1>Chapter 119 Damian's Decision</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Damian walked out of Paradise Hotel, his expression was unusually grave. His mind was wrestling with uncertainty and hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't decide whether to tell Brian about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, there was the question of whether he should join Thomas' side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Thomas had aligned himself with Denzel, one of the heirs to the Vaughn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Denzel's status, the Vaughn family's terrifying influence, and Thomas' strategic mind, he could hardly imagine how Brian could lead Trillion Group through this crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should he withdraw his investment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should he buy shares in Quadrillion Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Damian's mind was a tangled mess of thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat on the steps by the street, lit a cigarette, and deeply contemplated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally began to see a glimmer of clarity after finishing the entire pack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a gut feeling that Brian wasn't as simple as Thomas' investigation had suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's performance at the shareholders' meeting showed a sophistication that no one from the bottom of society could possess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to go to George Reynolds, the former chairman and first shareholder of Trillion Group, to find out what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mainly wanted to know why George had handed over his shares and chairman position to Brian for free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though George had retired and settled in his hometown over three hundred kilometers from Riverwood, that wouldn't stop him from visiting late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jumped in his car and headed straight for George's hometown without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his following decisions would shape his future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would never hurt to be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 1 AM, Damian arrived at George's home and rang the doorbell of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young, attractive housekeeper opened the door, giving Damian a puzzled look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you looking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi, I'm Damian, the third-largest shareholder of Trillion Group and a friend of Mr. Reynolds... I need to speak with him about something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reynolds is already asleep. Why don't you come back tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Damian could respond, the housekeeper closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait until tomorrow..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Damian pushed past the housekeeper and rushed into the villa, shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reynolds, it's Damian!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the guards moved to stop him, George's elderly but powerful voice came from upstairs. "Bring him up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the housekeeper led Damian to the upstairs bedroom, where Mr. Reynolds was waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his advanced age, Mr. Reynolds appeared sharp and alert, especially with his eagle-like eyes, which seemed to pierce right through people and command respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reynolds..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian bowed respectfully to the elderly man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George gave Damian a long, meaningful look. "Well, what brings a big shot like you to my humble home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reynolds, to be honest... I need your guidance on something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating, Damian explained Thomas' plan to withdraw investments and target the Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He concluded sincerely, "I need your advice on this, Mr. Reynolds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always knew Thomas was ambitious, but I never expected him to make such bold moves after my retirement, especially cozying up to the Vaughn family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George sighed and added, "But I'm retired now. I won't get involved in your affairs and can't offer any advice. You should head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian protested, his face full of frustration. "But Mr. Reynolds, the Trillion Group is your life's work. How can you watch it get destroyed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're mistaken. The Trillion Group was never mine. I was just managing it. Now it's simply returning to its rightful owners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Damian tried to speak again, George waved his hand dismissively. "I've said all I need to say. It's time for you to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abby, show him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian looked at George with a bitter expression, who had already laid back down. He gave one final bow and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Damian left, a contemptuous sneer crossed George's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those idiots following Thomas think they can break away just because they've got the Vaughn family in their corner? What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since this involves Mr. Edwards, I should report it to Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his phone and dialed a mysterious number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep, intimidating voice soon came through the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey George, you're supposed to be retired and enjoying your golden years... Why are you calling me in the middle of the night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, I have something important to report..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George then proceeded to explain everything that had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, a slight smile appeared on the mysterious and authoritative Godfather's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, things are finally getting interesting and challenging. Let's see if Brian can pass this test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can't handle even this much, there's no point in keeping him around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm looking for the strongest successor, not some worthless kid who wastes time and opportunities."</span></p></div>
