        <h1>Chapter 1 Humiliate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the luxurious Evans mansion, the party was in full swing, crystal chandeliers casting a golden glow over the champagne-soaked crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a night to honor Amanda Evans on her eightieth birthday, and every family member had flocked to pay their respects and shower her with gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, check this out! These are some top-notch, century-old medicinal herbs. Cost me a million smackers! Here's to you living forever and drowning in good fortune!"</span><span> Someone exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma, see this emerald bracelet? Two million right here. May your special day be filled with all the good things you deserve, and may all your wishes come true!</span><span> </span><span>Happy birthday</span><span>!</span><span>"</span><span> another </span><span>chimed in</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amanda surveyed the mountain of presents with a satisfied nod. The room buzzed with laughter and chatter, creating a heartwarming scene of family unity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amanda in a good mood, Brian Edwards - the family's deadbeat son-in-law - steeled himself and blurted out, "Grandma, there's this new bio-electrotherapy thing going around. Could I borrow you a million bucks? It might help fix my, uh, energy problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell dead silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gawked at Brian like he'd just grown a second head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could believe that on Amanda's big day, this loser not only showed up with no gift but also had the balls to ask for a loan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia Evans, Brian's wife, was seeing red. Her cheeks burned red with humiliation - she'd rather crawl under a rock and die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian could say another word, she lashed out and slapped him across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you low-life scumbag! I'm done with you. </span><span>Let</span><span>'</span><span>s get </span><span>divorce</span><span>d</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian staggered back, covering his stinging cheek, with his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years ago, during a family mission, he'd met Sophia and thought he'd hit the jackpot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To marry her</span><span>, he didn't bat an eye before turning down the family's arranged match. </span><span>And he even</span><span> cut himself off from the family and kissed goodbye to his chance of becoming the next Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind the scenes, he'd poured money and connections into making Evans Group a local powerhouse. All for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even took a rain of bullets to save her. </span><span>And t</span><span>hose wounds drained him of his energy, left him barely hanging on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of that mattered. He was still head-over-heels, ready to do anything for Sophia without a single complaint, like a loyal servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Brian wante</span><span>d </span><span>was to borrow a bit of cash to get his energy back while Amanda was in high spirits. But Sophia </span><span>just </span><span>exploded right there in front of everyone, slapped him hard, and demanded a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divorce? Sophia, you must be joking, right?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia glared at him, her eyes cold as ice. "Do I look like I'm kidding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's jaw dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to plead his case, Amanda cut him off. "Brian, it's time you knew the truth. Two years ago, I set Sophia up with a great guy. And they've been inseparable ever since!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, come on out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In walked Ryan Carter, looking sharp in his designer clothes. He sauntered over and handed Amanda a bank card and a contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam Evans, here's five million dollars and a contract worth a billion. Wishing you good health and a long life," Ryan grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wonderful, just wonderful..." Amanda beamed and nudged Sophia into Ryan's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, I'll make sure Sophia dumps that good-for-nothing so you two can be together properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Madam Evans!" Ryan wrapped his arm around Sophia possessively, smirking at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia </span><span>proudly </span><span>nestled into Ryan's embrace, looking like a lovesick puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd around them whooped and clapped, egging them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stood there, feeling like the ground had just been pulled out from under him. His mind was a complete mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around how all his love and sacrifice had ended up in this disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes ablaze with blood, he </span><span>fix</span><span>ed a death-stare on Sophia and let out a wild, hysterical roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, you filthy bitch! What the hell did I ever do </span><span>wrong</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia chuckled coldly. "Think of it as a little game we played... and now, game over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian roared, "I cut ties with my family for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I lost my energy, became a useless wreck just to save your sorry ass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave </span><span>you </span><span>my all, every last bit of me! And now you're telling me it was </span><span>just</span><span> a damned game?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes bulged with blood vessels, howling like a rabid dog, tears of rage streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whole fucking love story? Just one big cosmic joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the big deal? You didn't actually think I'd be into a loser like you, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia ran her manicured hand over Ryan's rugged jawline and looked at Brian like he was dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "I, Sophia, go for guys like Mr. Carter&mdash;the cream of the crop, heirs to massive fortunes. Not some two-bit, dirt-poor slob like you. Got that through your thick skull?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Sophia flicked a pre-made prenuptial divorce agreement at Brian like it was a piece of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sign it and get the hell out. Don't ruin our fun here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others quickly joined in. "Yeah, sign and hit the road!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan sneered at Brian, saying, "What? Need me to do it for you, punk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going too far!" Brian couldn't hold back his boiling rage any</span><span>more</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>He lunged forward, ready to take these backstabbers down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in an instant, Ryan kicked him so hard he went flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed onto the hard floor, groaning in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan wasn't just the boss of the Carter Group; he was a battle-hardened ex-special forces dude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, who'd lost his energy and was beat up, didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian tried to scramble up, Ryan planted his shoes right on Brian's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing but a piss-ant trying to go after my girl. Know your place. Stop embarrassing yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia shot Brain a glare, full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she locked her arms in Ryan's and said, "Honey, it's Grandma's birthday. Don't mess up the carpet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No worries, I will take out this trash right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan let out an evil grin, then popped Brian's arm out of its socket and forced his hand to scribble on the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Ryan grabbed him by the collar and threw him downstairs like a sack of garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit... Carter's a beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man, once special forces, always special forces. What a badass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Downstairs, Brian somehow survived the fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed like crazy, and blood spurted from his mouth and nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As cheers drifted down from upstairs, his blood boiled with rage and bitter injustice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Revenge was all Brian could think about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd make Sophia eat those words and reclaim every single thing he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, he fumbled for his phone and made one last call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he passed out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, a fancy motorcade rolled up to the curb. With hundreds of Rolls-Royces, Mercedes-Maybachs, and Land Rovers, it was like a moving display of luxury&mdash;a true testament to opulence on wheels.</span></p></div>
