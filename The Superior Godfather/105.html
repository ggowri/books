        <h1>Chapter 105 Do You Like Me or Her?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian narrowed his eyes slightly, and a hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only people who had a grudge against him recently were Sophia, Ryan, and Thomas, the second largest shareholder of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ryan was dead. Sophia didn't have the ability at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Brian didn't think Thomas had the balls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the other heirs of the Godfather mentioned by Zoe, Brian knew very well how arrogant they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those guys didn't take him seriously back then, let alone now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless he showed extraordinary abilities, they would not pay attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it was not ruled out that they would send someone to test him and want to get rid of him in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this possibility was very small, at least for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that someone was watching him in the dark?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian narrowed his eyes slightly and thought, "Could it be because of Rachael?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Rachael's reaction when she left in a hurry, Brian became more determined in this idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always felt that Rachael was not simple, but he had never thought of investigating her in depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it seemed necessary for him to investigate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a deep voice, "Help me check Rachael's background."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe raised the corner of her mouth and looked at Brian with interest. "Mr. Edwards, are you talking about the woman who drank with you in the bar that night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Zoe sharply. "Yes. Have you investigated her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe licked the corner of her mouth with her tongue, threw a coquettish look at Brian, and said aggrievedly, "I was afraid that she approached you with some purpose. So for your safety, I secretly investigated her. Mr. Edwards, are you blaming me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was already charming and attractive, and her expression made Brian even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly coughed and explained, "Ahem. Don't get me wrong. I didn't mean that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe came close to Brian and hooked her hands around his neck. She used her black stockings-wrapped feet to soothe his erect penis, and asked coquettishly, "Mr. Edwards, who is more important to you, she or I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian answered without hesitation, "Is there any need to ask? Of course it's you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Zoe was surprised. "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian grabbed Zoe's big, full breasts and said seriously, "Of course it's true. I'm saying this with my conscience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the movement of Brian's hands, Zoe said coquettishly, "Mr. Edwards, you are bad. You are touching my conscience. Humph. You are definitely not speaking from your heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem. Sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian quickly retracted his hand and placed it on his chest. He said seriously, "I'm saying this with my conscience now. You are more important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Brian's serious look, Zoe was very moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She happily kissed Brian on the face with her flaming red lips. "Mr. Edwards, love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled slightly, lifted Zoe's chin with his hand to admire her stunning face, and then kissed her affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't say anything, but Zoe could feel it deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With deep feelings, Zoe couldn't help but kiss Brian back, and the kiss became more passionate and devoted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until both of them felt it was difficult to breathe that they reluctantly ended the intense kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, let me serve you well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked at Brian's erect cock with an obsessed look. She slowly leaned down, took it into her mouth, and licked it gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Zoe's affection and passion, Brian responded. He stretched out his big hands to rub her plump buttocks wrapped in the bodysuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he tasted her already wet pussy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, God..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the teasing of Brian's tongue, Zoe felt her soul tremble. She seemed to fly into the sky and rush to heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Brian had caressed her in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body and heart were satisfied like never before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely lost in his gentle touch and kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she also gave her most enthusiastic response, taking his cock to the deepest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian could clearly feel the hot breath she exhaled when she breathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe then sat on him and started riding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her waist twisted, her breasts swayed, her black stockings were sultry, and she was incredibly beautiful. Such scenes constantly stimulated Brian's nerves and made him intoxicated.</span></p></div>
