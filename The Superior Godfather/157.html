        <h1>Chapter 157 Dangerous Temptation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara's adorable face lit up with a joyful smile. "The ingredients! Didn't you say yesterday you'd cook for me, Mr. Edwards? So before the sun even came up, I went to the seafood market and the grocery store to buy everything. Look, these are all super fresh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hadn't expected her to be this enthusiastic. Smiling, he said, "It's just the two of us. Can we even eat all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara grinned. "I've got a big appetite, remember? Just turn everything into something delicious and I promise I won't leave a single bite behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her bright, eager expression, Brian couldn't help but reach out and ruffle her hair. "You're right, I totally forgot that you're a little foodie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara giggled and carried the bags of ingredients into the villa. Brian, already well aware of how greedy this girl could be when it came to food, didn't wait. He got straight to work sorting the ingredients and prepping for the meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't offer to help at all. Instead, she sat at the dining table with her chin resting in her hands, watching Brian work in the kitchen with great interest. Her legs swung under the table, her feet wrapped in white stockings, and her whole face radiated excitement as she eagerly waited for the food. She looked so adorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was because Velmara had gotten up so early, but somewhere in the middle of waiting, she dozed off with her head resting on the table. When Brian noticed, he couldn't help but smile and picked up the pace in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, the aroma of the food drifted over and stirred Velmara from her nap. Her lashes fluttered as she slowly opened her sleepy eyes. "Mmm... That smells so good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she saw the feast laid out in front of her, any hint of drowsiness disappeared. Her eyes lit up, and she threw her arms around Brian in excitement. "Whoa, this looks incredible! You seriously outdid yourself, Mr. Edwards. I love you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a second, Brian was stunned by the sensation of two soft mounds pressing up against his chest, squishing slightly from the hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did this little rascal just body-slammed me with those?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gently patted Velmara's head and chuckled, "Alright, dig in before it gets cold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She beamed, "Okay then... time to eat!" With that, she dove in, wasting no time as she began devouring the meal. The way she wolfed down the food with such adorable greediness was just too cute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the entire feast had been wiped clean by Velmara alone. But even then, she didn't look the least bit full. Still craving more, she sighed, "Looks like I didn't buy enough this time. Next time, I'll be sure to grab more... five bags, at least."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help teasing her, "With the way you eat, five bags won't be enough. Might as well haul in a whole cart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara's eyes instantly sparkled. "That's exactly why you're the best, Mr. Edwards. Brilliant as always! A whole cart, huh? I'm doing that next time for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gave her a helpless smile, looking at her with a mix of amusement and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I really have no idea how she could eat so much and still not gain a pound. Her figure has always stayed in perfect shape, especially her chest&mdash;full, round, and just straight-up unbelievable. Did all those calories go straight to her boobs or what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Brian's gaze, Velmara smirked, slowly running her tongue along the corner of her lips. She leaned forward, giving him an even deeper view of her generous curves, and asked in a teasing tone, "Do you like what you see, Mr. Edwards? Wanna try it out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes couldn't help but drop to her bouncing cleavage under that skimpy maid outfit, and he swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any man would've had a hard time resisting that kind of temptation. But he managed to calm himself down quickly and forced the heat rising in his gut to die down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara, unlike Zoe, had always been a kid in Brian's eyes. He'd only ever treated Velmara like a little sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So right then, he reached out and ruffled Velmara's hair with his large hand, his tone half-exasperated. "What do you think I am, you brat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instantly looked like she'd been wronged. Her soft pink lips puffed out into a pout, and tears welled up in her big, glistening eyes. "But... I'm already an adult! I'm not a kid anymore, Mr. Edwards, you can't just judge me by how I look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's heart practically melted at the sight of Velmara's tearful pout. He quickly tried to soothe her. "Come on now, don't cry. You're not a kid. I'm sorry, that was on me. I shouldn't have judged you by your looks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her big, tearful eyes full of longing, she looked up at Brian and asked, "Then... can I serve you the way Zoe does?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stiffened instantly and his heart skipped a beat. "Y-you've got the wrong idea... Zoe and I&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even finish, Velmara cut him off, "You don't have to lie to me, Mr. Edwards. Zoe already told me everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian froze. "What... She told you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara nodded seriously, her adorable face filled with determination. "Mhm. She said you're the most amazing, most powerful man in the world. I want to be your woman too, just like Zoe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hadn't expected Velmara and Zoe to be that close, to the point where they shared everything with each other. And now, he had no idea how to respond, stammering, "I... well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he'd always treated Velmara like a younger sister. He wasn't mentally prepared to see her any other way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Brian could process it, she climbed onto his lap, wrapped her soft arms around his neck, and whispered something that sent a shiver down his spine. "Let me take care of you, Mr. Edwards."</span></p></div>
