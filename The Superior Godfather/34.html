        <h1>Chapter 34 Temptation From Anastasia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was five in the afternoon at Riverside Villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian spotted Anastasia waiting by the entrance as he approached the complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flowing hair framed her exquisite features, while her perfect figure looked stunning in a white custom Calvin Klein t-shirt and fitted jeans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her elegant and calm demeanor, she stood out like a beautiful painting against the backdrop of the residential complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry to keep you waiting, Rachael," Brian said as he hurried over with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia looked at him and replied with mock annoyance, "You think a simple 'sorry' cuts it? You owe me dinner, at least."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem," Brian agreed readily. "What are you in the mood for? Steak or pizza?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sick of eating out all the time. Why don't you cook instead?" Anastasia suggested, trying to sound casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had deliberately chosen this time to visit, hoping to score another dinner at Brian's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the delicious meal he'd cooked yesterday was still fresh in her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, take a seat while I make dinner. After we eat, I'll help treat your condition," Brian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He showed Anastasia into the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian poured her a cup of coffee, turned on the TV, and went to the kitchen. There, he pulled ingredients from the fridge and got to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying on the couch, Anastasia sipped her coffee while watching his busy figure in the kitchen. A soft smile played across her beautiful lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, she loved this atmosphere and feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her feel relaxed, comfortable, and at peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dinner's ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about an hour and a half, Brian called out steaming plates of delicious food from the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had prepared pepperoni pizza, steak, Buffalo wings, grilled pork ribs, pork chops, salad, and apple pie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich aromas made Anastasia's mouth water uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never considered herself a foodie but couldn't resist Brian's cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, Rachael, try this and tell me if it's to your taste," Brian smiled as he placed a piece of grilled pork ribs on her plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tender, spicy, and flavorful meat melted in her mouth when she took a bite. The sensation was so incredible that Anastasia crossed her legs involuntarily, feeling like she was floating on cloud nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experience was so impressive that she couldn't help but let out a soft, satisfied moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sound was incredibly seductive, and when it reached Brian's ears, it sent his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but swallow hard as his eyes traced Anastasia's alluring lips and elegant figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, why do you keep staring at me? You should eat too," Anastasia said with a smile, noticing his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never understood the phrase 'feast for the eyes' until now... Just looking at your beauty is enough to fill me up," Brian replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's lips curved into a smile, her heart melting like honey at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him and teased, "Are you serious or just trying to make me happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear to God, you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen," Brian answered without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia thought momentarily before asking, "How do I compare to your ex? I heard you loved her so much you even took a bullet for her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression darkened at her words and he fell into a long silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His marriage to Sophia wasn't just a stain on his life. It was his biggest mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, it made him feel like a complete failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought up your ex-wife," Anastasia said apologetically, seeing his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, you don't need to apologize. It's just a past I'd rather forget. I admit I loved her once, but now she's nothing more than a passerby in my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman like her isn't worth my dedication... I felt regretful about how much I gave to that relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian let out a self-deprecating laugh as he picked up his glass and downed the red wine in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia playfully winked at Brian. "So, am I worth your dedication?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought momentarily before thoughtfully responding, "I don't know you well enough to answer that, but I believe you are someone worth trusting and befriending. I hope we can be friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia brushed her bangs aside and leaned forward, deliberately revealing the tempting expanse of her pale chest. She gazed at Brian with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just friends? Don't you want something more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gulp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but swallow hard as he stared at Anastasia's alluring figure and the glimpse of her pale, full breasts. His gaze grew heated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she trying to hint at something?</span></p></div>
