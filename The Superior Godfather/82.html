        <h1>Chapter 82 Cerberus Crew in Poskon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days had passed since Sophia had laid Ryan to rest, and the weight of the tragedy had aged her beyond her years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After much hesitation, she decided to visit Ethan, Ryan's father, in prison, accompanied by Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia! What are you doing here alone? Where's Ryan? Has he finally joined the War Deities and caught the Master's attention? That's why he couldn't come to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's face was a mask of urgency as he spoke, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For days, the mere thought of his son joining the War Deities had kept him awake at night, buzzing with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia felt a pang of discomfort at Ethan's hopeful gaze, unsure of how to break the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne sighed deeply, her voice steady but somber. "Ethan, I'm here to tell you something very important. You need to brace yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's brow furrowed in confusion. "What could possibly require preparation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Anne delivered the devastating blow. "Ryan... he's dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's face drained of color as he shot to his feet, disbelief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Ryan is dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That can't be! You're joking, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ethan Carter, we're not joking... Ryan is truly gone." Sophia, her heart heavy, held out a gold watch. "This is his belonging. Please take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes widened as he recognized the familiar watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the ground had been pulled from beneath him; his face turned ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan had been waiting in prison for Ryan to join the War Deities and take him home, never imagining the news he would receive would be this horrific.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he could no longer contain his grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He collapsed into sobs. "Ryan! My Ryan... oh, no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ethan Carter, please take care of yourself. I'm so sorry for your loss," Sophia said softly, her own heart aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned to leave, Ethan suddenly called out, "Sophia, tell me the truth. How did Ryan die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw the police footage. He was under some external pressure, lost his grip, and jumped down the building..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's words hung heavy in the air, and Ethan paused, confusion etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan has always been so strong-willed. What could have possibly pushed him to that point?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The footage wasn't clear or complete, so I can't say for sure what triggered it... but there's no doubt he took his own life." Sophia's voice was laced with bitterness and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she too was grappling with the question of what had driven Ryan to such despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan fell into a long, heavy silence, the weight of her words sinking in like a stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ethan looked up at Sophia with fierce determination. "Sophia, for Ryan's sake, I need you to do me a favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia nodded. "Mr. Ethan Carter, whatever it is, just say the word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes flickered with hatred as he spoke through gritted teeth, "I need you to find Ryan's mother and inform her of his death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She needs to investigate the circumstances surrounding his passing and help seek vengeance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia was taken aback. "But didn't Ryan's mother die shortly after he was born?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan confessed, "No. That was a lie I told him. The truth is, my union with his mother was purely accidental. And her identity is far too significant; she is Luna Sinclair, the leader of the Cerberus Crew in Poskon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes widened in shock, disbelief etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia felt the tumult of emotions raging within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cerberus Crew was infamous, a powerful gang ruling the underground world of Poskon with an iron fist, boasting hundreds of thousands of members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelation that Ryan's mother was Luna, the head of such a notorious group, was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the wake of her initial shock, excitement coursed through her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could win Luna's support, the tides would surely turn in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan continued, "I have a private safe at Switz Bank that contains a token Luna left behind. Take it to the Cerberus Crew and find her; she'll do everything in her power to assist you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophia, I'm entrusting this mission to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Sophia replied, "Mr. Ethan Carter, you can count on me. I'll do everything I can to fulfill this mission and avenge Ryan."</span></p></div>
