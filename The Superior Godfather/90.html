        <h1>Chapter 90 Unreasonable Demand</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jones, this way, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Karen and Brian were escorted upstairs to Dylan's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was lounging in a chair with his legs crossed, sporting a slicked-back hairstyle and a cigar hanging from his mouth. He exhaled a cloud of smoke, looking like he owned the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His two intimidating bodyguards, a scarred middle-aged man and a tattooed bald guy, stood by silently, making him seem even more untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his eyes landed on Karen, they gleamed with an unsettling mixture of mockery and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jones," he said, his voice dripping with amusement, "you really gave me and my guys a hard time yesterday. We were starting to think you ran off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen shifted uncomfortably under his gaze, her distaste barely concealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She responded coolly, "Mr. Reed, please. Everyone knows you have spies everywhere in Riverwood. I'd never be able to slip past you. I was just trying to figure out how to raise the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan took a leisurely puff of his cigar and slowly blew out the smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to raise money, huh? Well, have you managed to come up with the 86 million dollars yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face froze. "Eighty-six million? Mr. Reed, I only borrowed 20 million from you. When did it become 86 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's lips curled into a knowing grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jones, you know our company's interest rates are pretty steep. Over the years, it's been compounding... It's only natural that 20 million becomes 86 million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we've been paying you every month! We've already paid over six million! Isn't that enough for the interest?" Karen said, trying to keep her voice steady, though her frustration was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought paying back the 20 million would settle everything, but now it seemed like she was stuck with 86 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole thing felt insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes narrowed as he realized what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was nothing but a scam to bleed her dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If six million is enough to cover the interest, how's my company supposed to make a profit?" Dylan sneered. His eyes roamed over Karen's figure, completely ignoring Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if you don't have the cash, we can always come to another arrangement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another arrangement?" Karen's voice was tight, a warning edge to her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan leaned back in his chair, swirling a glass of red wine in his hand. His eyes gleamed as he ogled her. "You could always pay with your body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's face turned red with anger. "You... Mr. Reed, you can't be serious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No more talking. Pay up, or trade your body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's expression flickered between disbelief and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe Dylan would push her like this, but with all his men around, she had no way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze shifted toward Brian, silently pleading for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know if he'd still be willing to help, especially now that the debt had ballooned to 86 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he turned his back on her, she was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seemingly sensing her distress, Brian placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder and gave her a warm smile. "Don't worry. I've got this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't about to let this slide. Karen was his woman now, and he wasn't going to stand by while she was humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dylan's eyes narrowed, the malice in them palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're planning on paying her debt?" Dylan sneered, looking Brian up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared him down, unfazed. "Of course. It's only fair to pay off a debt. But Mr. Reed, your interest is a bit excessive, don't you think?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I cut you a deal? Fifty million, and we call it even?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was offering 50 million, more than enough to cover the debt, and it would still be a big win for Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dylan wasn't having it. He scoffed, his gaze full of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me a break. Who the hell do you think you are? Not a penny less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't come up with the full amount, then get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression turned icy, and a dangerous glint flashed in his eyes. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. You better catch it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flicked his wrist, and the card flew through the air like a dart, speeding straight toward Dylan.</span></p></div>
