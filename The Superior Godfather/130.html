        <h1>Chapter 130 The Unexpected Turn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After departing from Trillion Group, Thomas and Eric took Zac and his team to Quadrillion Group's headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the company had not officially opened yet, all preparations and equipment were ready and it would be put into use soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the company hadn't officially launched yet, everything was in place&mdash;from the lavish interior design to the state-of-the-art equipment, all ready for immediate use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shareholders and senior executives couldn't hide their excitement as they took in the opulent surroundings. Thomas, noting their impressed expressions, smiled, "Come on. I'll take you to meet Mr. Vaughn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement sent a ripple of excitement through the group. None of them had expected to meet a big shot like Denzel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas led them to the chairman's office on the top floor, where they found Denzel reclining in his chair, gazing out at the cityscape through floor-to-ceiling windows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group, led by Thomas and Zac, bowed respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vaughn, nice to meet you," they greeted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One said, "We've heard so much about you, Mr. Vaughn. It's a great honor to be working under your leadership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel turned to face the team Thomas had brought, a satisfied smile playing across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello. From this day forward, we're one team," he declared. "You'll all receive promotions above your previous positions at Trillion Group, along with doubled salaries. I trust we'll work together to make this company thrive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The generous offer left them overwhelmed with gratitude and excitement. They couldn't have been more pleased with their decision to join Quadrillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have our word, Mr. Vaughn," they pledged earnestly. "We'll give everything we have to ensure the company's success."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I look forward to seeing that," Denzel replied with an approving nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His motivation for having Thomas establish this company went beyond merely preventing Brian from passing the test and reclaiming his position as the Godfather's successor. He was also concerned about Anastasia potentially leveraging Brian's influence against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Denzel saw this as his opportunity to make his mark in the real estate industry and establish his own legacy&mdash;a move that would significantly boost his chances of leading the Vaughn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the pleasantries, Denzel inquired about the current situation at Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas responded confidently, "Mr. Vaughn, we've brought over all the executives and core team members. Before leaving, we strategically spread rumors about Trillion Group's impending bankruptcy due to a broken capital chain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The company must be in complete disarray by now. When we left, Callian, the head of security, was storming into Brian's office with his team, demanding their wages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I imagine Brian and Celeste are in quite a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They exhausted the company's accounts buying back our shares&mdash;they can't even cover payroll."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded with smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew human nature well enough to predict that if Brian and his team couldn't meet payroll, they'd face an uprising from angry employees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Let me see for myself," Denzel said with interest, walking to the window and raising a telescope to observe Trillion Group's offices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his amused expression quickly turned to one of displeasure, his face darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene before him was nothing like they had predicted. Instead of chaos and riots, the employees appeared calm and focused, working diligently at their desks with genuine smiles on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's expression turned grave as he turned to Thomas. "Thomas, explain this to me. What exactly am I looking at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas stood confused, "Mr. Vaughn, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See for yourself!" Denzel barely contained his anger as he thrust the telescope toward Thomas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas grabbed it and peered through with mounting uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in shock. "How is this possible?" he muttered in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Thomas, what's wrong?" Eric asked, as he, Zac, and the others sensed something amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Thomas passed the telescope around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they looked through it, each reacting with increasing dismay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be right&mdash;they should be rioting for their pay. Why is everyone working normally?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell did Brian and Celeste do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stood there bewildered, more than 20 armored trucks pulled up to Trillion Group's entrance</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched the teams begin unloading boxes full of cash into the building, creating an impressive spectacle that none of them had anticipated.</span></p></div>
