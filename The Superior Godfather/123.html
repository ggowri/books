        <h1>Chapter 123 The Mastermind</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste eyed Brian's damp appearance with displeasure. "What took you so long to answer the door? What were you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry," Brian apologized, "I was in the shower and didn't hear you at first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A shower? At this hour?" Celeste's eyes narrowed with suspicion. "You were not fooling around with some woman in there, were you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds she'd heard hadn't exactly matched those of running water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gestured at his wet hair. "Look, I haven't even had time to dry it properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned serious. "Besides, do you really think I'm the type to fool around? You're the only woman who I care about. Feel free to search upstairs if you don't believe me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sincerity in Brian's expression melted Celeste's doubts away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She eyed him, her tone turning playful. "Never mind. Whoever you're fooling around with isn't my business. Though I am curious why you're showering so late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian snorted. "You're one to talk. After that little fashion show you put on today, flaunting your legs&mdash;how could I not think about them when I tried to sleep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It made me so horny. Had to take a cold shower just to cool down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste burst out laughing, caught off guard by his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a flutter of pride warmed her chest at the reminder of her allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian found himself momentarily fascinated by her laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore only a thin nightgown with nothing underneath, and through the neckline, he could see her breasts moving with each laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pink nipples pressed against the fabric were particularly enticing, making him swallow hard as he imagined tasting them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt his intense gaze, her cheeks flushing crimson. She quickly crossed her arms over her chest&mdash;she hadn't even had time to put on underwear before rushing over with the urgent news</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't resist teasing her. "Coming to my place dressed like this in the middle of the night... Were you lying awake thinking about me, desperate to throw yourself into my arms?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wish," Celeste rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then her expression turned grave. "I have something important to tell you. Damian says Thomas and the others are jumping ship and withdrawing their investment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mass resignation and divestment?" Brian sneered, his face showing no trace of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I underestimated their boldness, but this might work in our favor," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you say that? Do you realize the massive impact this will have on the company?" Celeste stared at him, astounded by his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I understand the impact," Brian replied calmly. "But compared to regaining control of our equity, it's negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, their voluntary resignation saves us considerable severance pay. Some executives with long-term contracts will even have to pay us penalties for breach of contract. Isn't that advantageous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Celeste could respond, he continued, "I know what you're thinking&mdash;the stock price will plummet in the short term. But trust me, it will rise again. As for those deserters, I'll make sure they regret their decision for the rest of their lives. They'll come crawling back, begging for mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled wryly, baffled by the source of his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to speak when Brian cut in, "So, who's really behind Thomas? He doesn't have the capability to orchestrate such a large-scale resignation and investment withdrawal on his own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste hesitated briefly before answering, "It's Denzel Vaughn, one of the five heirs to the Vaughn family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Denzel Vaughn?" Brian narrowed his eyes, a cold glint flashing through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suspected Denzel was the one who had placed the bounty on his head on the Dark Web.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First an assassination attempt, and now this competing company. It seemed the Vaughn heirs were determined to keep him away from Anastasia.</span></p></div>
