        <h1>Chapter 128 The Internal Crisis</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian and Celeste exchanged helpless glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security department's primary role was to protect company assets and maintain order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was their team leader, Callian, leading the charge into chaos</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The company's internal situation was clearly more volatile than they'd anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Farrah, looking attractive in her executive assistant attire, rushed to apologize. "Mr. Edwards, Ms. Hawthorne, I'm so sorry&mdash;there were too many of them to stop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it," Brian said with a dismissive wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attention fixed on Callian, and the room seemed to grow heavier with an invisible pressure. "Your name and position? And why exactly are you leading this disturbance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Brian's scrutiny, Callian seemed to shrink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His earlier bravado evaporated as he looked at Brian in fear and stammered, "Mr. Edwards, I'm Callian Efron, the security team Leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you've got it wrong&mdash;I'm not trying to cause trouble. The Director told us before he left that the company was broke and about to fold. He said we should get our final pay and get out while we could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" With all the rumors flying around, everyone's panicking, and..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jensen, that treacherous bastard!" Damian exploded as Celeste's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jensen Reeves, the security director, had been under Damian's leader. The company had treated him exceptionally well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he'd not only betrayed the company with Thomas but had deliberately instigated Callian to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's fist crashed onto the desk. "Who fed you this nonsense about the company being broke and facing bankruptcy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden outburst made everyone flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callian and his followers seemed to physically shrink, their eyes downcast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze bore into Callian. "So you want to resign and get your final payment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callian swallowed hard. "Yes, Mr. Edwards. My mother's critically ill and in the hospital. I desperately need the money..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say no more. I understand," Brian said, his tone softening slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Celeste. "Have Finance process his payment immediately, plus an extra month's salary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Celeste nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Brian's two billion in the accounts, meeting payroll wouldn't be an issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callian's eyes widened in surprise and delight. "Thank you, Mr. Edwards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone else planning to resign?" Brian asked the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some hesitation, over a hundred employees stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half were Callian's security team members; the rest came from various departments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, my wife's due any day now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, my wife's sister needs help with her second baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian listened to each case with apparent understanding, authorizing the extra month's salary for all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the payments hit their accounts immediately, Callian and the others exchanged startled looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized the company's supposed insolvency had been exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining employees, still wavering, were astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone else facing family emergencies who needs to resign?" Brian asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as everyone was hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trillion Group treated them well, and finding better opportunities elsewhere would be challenging. Maybe waiting things out wasn't such a bad idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled, "I understand that seeing senior executives depart has left everyone feeling uncertain about the future. Let me assure you: this is simply a strategic realignment. The company's future is brighter than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am here to assure you that the company's future will be even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To demonstrate our commitment to those choosing to stay, we're offering a 20-thousand-dollar bonus. Ten thousand will be distributed today, with the remainder paid with next month's salary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if anyone changes their mind after receiving the bonus? They'll still get that extra month's salary on their way out."</span></p></div>
