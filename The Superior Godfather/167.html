        <h1>Chapter 167 Racing Against Time</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of heat surged through Celeste's chest, her body trembling as a soft gasp slipped from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say a word, Brian's restraint shattered. Overcome with desire, he wrapped one arm around her slender waist, his other hand gliding over the curve of her hips. He buried his face in the plush warmth of her chest, nuzzling and savoring the moment with unrestrained fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste melted under the onslaught, her body going limp, too overwhelmed to muster any resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift tug, Brian pulled down her neckline and bra, exposing the delicate swell of her breasts. His lips found the sensitive peak of her nipple, teasing it with gentle sucks and flicks of his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... mm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste let out a moan, a mix of satisfaction and aching need, her voice trembling with intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian's teasing grew bolder, her moans deepened, her instincts taking over. She reached out, her slender fingers threading through his hair, pulling him closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's hands roamed freely, tracing the contours of her hips and thighs, reveling in every inch of her softness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a sharp rip, he tore through her black stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the fabric shredding was like music to his ears, igniting a fire in his veins. His body thrummed with excitement, every nerve alight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He captured her lips in a searing kiss, his hands busy, one kneading her breast, the other gripping the firm curve of her backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was powerless against the onslaught, her body surrendering completely, collapsing against him as he took control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawthorne, everything alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden voice of Wray Avila, the butler, cut through the haze as he tapped on the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd noticed the car idling in the driveway for too long and, concerned for Celeste's safety, had come to check on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The interruption startled them like deer in headlights. They sprang apart, frantically adjusting their clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, Celeste rolled down the window, forcing a calm smile. "I'm fine, Wray. Just catching up with a friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, carry on then," Wray said, a knowing smirk tugging at his lips as he caught sight of the lipstick smudged on Brian's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to leave but paused, glancing back with a mischievous glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, by the way... Do you need a bottle of red to spice things up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste choked on her own breath, coughing violently as her face turned scarlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does Wray see through us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes flicked to Brian, spotting the telltale lipstick stain on his lips, and her embarrassment doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfect poise felt utterly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Brian a fierce glare. "This is all your fault, you jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised his hands defensively, grinning. "Hey, you're the one who yanked my ear! And it's not like I planned this. You're just too damn gorgeous. My body just... reacted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could retort, he leaned closer, his voice dropping to a teasing whisper. "Besides, you're gonna be mine eventually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... Ugh, I'm done arguing with you, you sleaze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still reeling from the awkward encounter, Celeste grabbed her purse and swung it at him twice before storming out of the car, her cheeks burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian watched her go, her silhouette impossibly alluring as she marched away. With a playful whistle, he called after her, "Hey, you're not even gonna invite me in for a drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drink your own damn booze!" Celeste snapped, shooting him a withering look over her shoulder as she headed toward the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian chuckled, shaking his head as he started the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before pulling away, he leaned out the window one last time. "Celeste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What now?" she huffed, pausing to glance back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got great taste," he said with a smirk. "That lingerie? Total knockout. I'm a fan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could fire back, Brian hit the gas, the Ferrari roaring off into the night, leaving Celeste stomping her foot in flustered fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you absolute pig!" she shouted after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the villa, Celeste had barely stepped out of the shower and settled onto her bed when her phone rang. The name on the screen sent a jolt through her. It was the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was calling to check on Brian, his interest in the man palpable even through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste didn't dare hold back, recounting everything she knew with meticulous detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, the man on the other end of the line finally responded, his voice touched with genuine surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, he managed to pull together billions of dollars to squash Trillion Group's crisis without breaking a sweat? And Zoe Guzman, Shadow Fang's leader, answers to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded, her tone respectful. "Yes, sir. And from my discreet inquiries, it seems the mastermind behind Trillion Group's crisis was Denzel, one of the Vaughn family's five heirs. But right after the crisis was resolved, Denzel and his entire Glory Group took a massive hit out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect Brian's involved, though it's just a hunch for now. I'm waiting on more intel. All I can say is, the more I see of Mr. Edwards, the less I understand him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather let out a low chuckle, but it quickly dissolved into a harsh, wracking cough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh... This kid... He's turning out to be more than I expected. Maybe I should start placing a few more bets on him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of his coughing sent a pang of worry through Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, your health..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fret," he rasped. "I've got a few years left in me yet. Keep a close eye on that young man. Anything worth knowing, you report back. Cough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could respond, the line went dead, leaving only the drone of the busy signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stood on her balcony, gazing out at the city's twinkling skyline, the Godfather's words echoing in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quiet murmur slipped from her lips. "Brian, time's running out. You'd better step up fast."</span></p></div>
