        <h1>Chapter 56 Office Flirting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt a soft touch on his chest as a scent wafted toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could distinctly feel Aria's breasts pressing against him, their softness and elasticity evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Aria's breasts are really big and soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does she want to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is she trying to express gratitude with her body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt a burning desire rising in his heart, and his blood seemed to boil at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could no longer suppress his desire and subconsciously stuck out his tongue to lick Aria's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria had never been this close to a man before, and a surge of electricity coursed through her, leaving her weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sweet taste of Aria's lips awakened Brian's desires. He directly held her lips and tasted them gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's delicate body trembled and she let out an alluring moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sound felt like a war drum to Brian, urging him on. He skillfully explored her mouth, took her smooth tongue into his mouth and sucked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kiss' intensity left Aria trembling, and she responded in shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, their passionate kiss ignited a fire between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Aria's response, Brian became more aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stroked Aria's back with one hand, while the other hand found its way to her breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He marveled at its softness and elasticity, kneading and feeling its constantly changing shape in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria, inexperienced, let out a moan, breathless from the sensations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was no longer satisfied with just touching her through her clothes. He slipped his hands beneath her shirt, teasing her hardened nipples with his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unbuttoned her shirt, removed her bra, and took her pale pink nipples into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria felt overwhelmed by Brian's kiss. Her vagina became wet, and she couldn't help but groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian guided her hand to his erect penis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria instinctively grasped it, shyly stroking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation sent waves of pleasure through Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could no longer bear such teasing and wanted to insert his penis into Aria's already wet vagina to enjoy the tight and smooth wrapping feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he prepared to take off her pants and explore deeper, Aria, who was lost in desire, suddenly came to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, don't," she said, her voice panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at her, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What's happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've taken off my pants, and you tell me no?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's not allowed, then why did you seduce and tease me just now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aren't you just teasing me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Brian was breaking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he felt it hard to hold it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian's disappointment, Aria's cheeks flushed as she explained, "Mr. Edwards, I'm sorry. I just wanted to give you a thank-you hug, but I got carried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really sorry for making you misunderstand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want him to think poorly of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing her explanation, Brian felt even more helpless and aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Since I misunderstood, you should have said it earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now we stop in this state. Are you just trying to make me feel uncomfortable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And...didn't you give a response at that time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Brian felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria brought him an exhilarating and novel feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was completely different from the feeling Zoe and Anne gave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's breasts felt amazing to squeeze and play with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered the sensation of being clamped and penetrated by them.</span></p></div>
