        <h1>Chapter 48 Eliza's Challenge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Anne finally left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was about to head out to buy groceries when Celeste called. "Mr. Edwards, there's trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thomas found out about Kevin's arrest and called an emergency shareholders' meeting at the company. Everyone's there, demanding answers from you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They say if you don't show up today and give them a satisfactory explanation, they'll pull their investments and the entire management team will resign and jump ship. Should I tell them you're on your way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Thomas to react so fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just taken control of Trillion Group, and the three beauty products were still in development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the shareholders pulled out and the executives resigned en masse, Trillion Group would be thrown into chaos and panic, with disastrous consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought for a moment and said, "Alright. Tell them to hold tight. I'll be there as soon as I wrap up what I'm doing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Brian grabbed his groceries and headed to the caf&eacute;, where Anastasia was sitting, working on her laptop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza, dressed in a black leather jacket and looking every bit the tough bodyguard, stood respectfully behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian walked up and smiled, "Rachael, sorry to keep you waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem. I was just finishing up some work," Anastasia replied with a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her laptop and handed it to Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then glanced curiously at the pile of groceries in Brian's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, she was here not only to test Brian as per Herbert's instruction but also to enjoy Brian's meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you get?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll see soon enough," Brian said with a mysterious grin, then turned his attention to Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, who's this?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza extended her hand. "Mr. Edwards, I'm Eliza Gray, Ms. Vaughn's bodyguard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian could respond, Eliza continued, "Ms. Vaughn says you're quite the fighter. How about a little sparring match?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were intense as she waited for his answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been tasked by Herbert to test Brian's skills. That was why she had this request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vaughn family's internal conflicts were heating up, and Herbert didn't want Anastasia wasting time on a loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Brian couldn't pass Eliza's test, Herbert would have Anastasia break off the engagement and marry another noble heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was well aware of this, which was why she didn't stop Eliza from issuing the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, however, remained calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're up for it, I would not turn you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They moved to the nearby lawn, and Brian, the perfect gentleman, offered to let Eliza have the first three moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?" Eliza asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a formidable Meta and well-known for her fighting prowess in the Vaughn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded and said in a good manner, "Absolutely. Don't hold back. Give it your all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza felt a flicker of irritation at what she perceived as Brian's arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's how you want it, don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she lunged forward like a cheetah, leaping into the air and bringing her right leg down on Brian with the force of a battle-axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her speed was incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was impressed. He thought, "She is truly something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just dodged the powerful strike when Eliza followed up with a kick to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so fast she left afterimages in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's some speed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes widened as he grabbed Eliza's leg just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blow was blocked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza's face flickered with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had given it her all, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, she channeled her dark elemental energy, broke free from Brian's grip, and launched a punch at his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian crossed his arms in front of him, blocking the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dull thud echoed as they both were pushed back by the force of the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian steadied himself and stared at Eliza with a sharp gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Gray, that's three moves. It's my turn now," he said, his voice low and intense.</span></p></div>
