        <h1>Chapter 3 The Enchanting Widow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days flew by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's injuries had fully healed. He was ready to leave the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His astonishing recovery left the medical staff in awe. Even Celeste was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she had found Brian, he was on the brink of death, gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's rapid healing was due to the resurgence of energy within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy not only granted him a powerful physique, incredible speed, and strength but also endowed him with exceptional regenerative abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian remove his hospital gown and don a tailored suit, Celeste was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Brian appeared exceptionally handsome and noble, a stark contrast to the disheveled state she had first encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at himself in the mirror, a confident smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked Celeste, "Ms. Hawthorne, how did the task I assigned you go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste promptly replied, "The company has been registered as per your instructions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said, "Excellent. Start recruiting immediately. I want the company operational in three days and qualified for Trillion Group's bidding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste responded, "Understood, I'll get on it right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she didn't know why Brian wanted to do this, she followed his orders and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the hospital, Brian headed straight to the Evans Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to reclaim what was rightfully his!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you worthless scum! You've been kicked out; how dare you come back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing but a jinx. Get out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Evans Villa, as soon as Brian stepped in, a stunningly beautiful woman blocked his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was exceptionally attractive, with burgundy hair cascading over her shoulders and a voluptuous, mature figure. Dressed in a black camisole and short skirt, she exuded a fiery sensuality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ample chest almost spilled out, and a deep cleavage line was tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Anne Evans, Sophia's half-sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her husband died suddenly on their wedding night from excessive drinking, she became a widow and returned to live at the Evans Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Brian became disabled, Anne frequently gave him a hard time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She not only targeted and humiliated him at every turn but also falsely accused him in front of the entire Evans family of stealing her underwear, spying on her in the shower, calling him a pervert, and sabotaging his relationship with Sophia...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said, "I'm here to retrieve what's mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian took a couple of steps forward, Anne shoved him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "There's nothing here that belongs to you... I burned your luggage a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression darkened. He asked coldly, "What about my photo album?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With hands on her hips, Anne arrogantly replied, "Of course, I burned that too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really burned my album?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, a murderous aura emanated from Brian. Like a beast ready to devour, he suddenly grabbed Anne by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the age of eight, Brian had survived an assassination attempt, during which his mother sacrificed her life to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That photo album contained pictures of his mother; it was his most cherished possession, holding his memories and longing for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne had the audacity to burn it, an unforgivable act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne mocked, "Do you think I'd lie to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know who that slut in the photos was, but just looking at her made me sick..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Brian couldn't hold back any longer. He slapped Anne hard across her still-alluring face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resounding smack, Anne was knocked to the ground, four finger marks appearing on her beautiful cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you cripple, how dare you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched her face, staring at Brian in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, no matter how she beat or insulted Brian, he never dared to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had previously endured Anne's torment because he valued his relationship with Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he was divorced from Sophia, there was no need to tolerate her family any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Anne had insulted his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of that, Brian slapped Anne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne screamed and fell in the living room.</span></p></div>
