        <h1>Chapter 74 I'm Master</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Ryan is about to join the War Deities and be highly valued by Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This news was indeed shocking to Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was even more surprising than the news that Brian became a partner of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the War Deities was once the most powerful organization in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Master stood at the pinnacle of power, only slightly less influential than the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ryan truly joined the War Deities and gained Master's favor, he would undoubtedly soar to fame and make a stunning debut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne took a deep breath and asked seriously, "Dad, you're not kidding me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, do you think we're joking?" Sophia smiled faintly and continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, Ryan has a cousin named Sam who has been working abroad. He was once the Unparalleled Blade, one of the Four Lords and Twelve Blades of the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not long ago, he received a summons from the Master to reorganize the War Deities, so he returned to Riverwood. And just now, he recommended Ryan to the Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the Master has scheduled a meeting with Ryan for tomorrow noon. With Sam's support and Ryan's talent, he will undoubtedly rise in ranks. Then, avenging ourselves on Brian will be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, just wait for that bastard Brian to beg for mercy after we crush him underfoot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Anne stood there in a daze; her mood seemed particularly complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was happy for Sophia and Ryan, but worried about Brian's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if Ryan truly gained the recognition and favor of the Master, then what awaited Brian would be Ryan's relentless revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Brian would have no chance of escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia frowned and asked, "Anne, what's with that look? Aren't you happy for Ryan and me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne quickly snapped out of it and said, "What are you talking about? Of course, I'm happy for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia took Anne's hand and said with a smile, "Let's go out and celebrate tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they finished celebrating, it was already past midnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne didn't go home with Sophia and the others. Instead, she went to Brian's villa and rang the doorbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending time with Brian, she'd developed an inexplicable feeling for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to see Brian get into trouble, so she planned to tell him the news and urge him to leave as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if Ryan successfully joined the War Deities tomorrow, it would be the end of Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here so late?" Seeing Anne standing at the door, Brian was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's simple yet pleasing attire caught Brian's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her long hair was tied up, revealing her charming face. Her mature and perfect figure, accentuated by a tight white top and light-colored jeans, highlighted her curves, exuding youth, energy, and a touch of sensuality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tightly stretched white shirt added a subtle yet undeniable allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her hands and lightly bit her lip, her gaze towards Brian filled with mixed emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have something important to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hesitated for a moment before inviting Anne inside. "Go ahead, tell me what's on your mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne hesitated before speaking, "I want you to leave Riverwood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Anne in surprise. "Leave Riverwood? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No reason, just go quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she tried to leave, Brian pulled her back, holding her mature and curvaceous body in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted her chin, his gaze cold and assertive. "If you want me to leave Riverwood, you'd better give me a good reason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his intense masculine presence, Anne's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, then spoke, "Ryan has a cousin who is a member of the War Deities, and he's one of the Four Lords and Twelve Blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He recommended Ryan to Master, and Master has scheduled a meeting with him tomorrow. If he gains the Master's approval and joins the War Deities...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then dealing with you will be a piece of cake for him, so you need to leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was slightly stunned. Then, he couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought it was something serious, but it turned out to be just this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he never expected that the cousin Sam recommended would be Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne asked in confusion, "What are you laughing at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled and said, "Don't worry, it's impossible for Ryan to get the approval of the Master and join the War Deities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne asked, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked intently at Anne and said seriously, "Because I am the Master you are talking about!"</span></p></div>
