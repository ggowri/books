        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian scanned the room and asked, "What do you think of my decision to transfer Eric to the publicity department?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was quick to respond, "Mr. Edwards is brilliant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others quickly joined in and praised Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, you know how to use people wisely. I admire you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Publicity Department needs someone like Mr. Eric Lee. We believe he will excel there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! Mr. Eric Lee has exceptional skills. He'll strengthen the department."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations on your promotion, Mr. Eric Lee! You have to treat us to a drink later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's face fell as he absorbed the crowd's praise. He looked as if he had lost his soul and looked extremely depressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that his career was completely over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas felt helpless, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Kevin's arrest, he had hoped to support Eric's ascent to vice president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the opposite happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric didn't even get the job of vice president and was even demoted to a powerless role in the publicity department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's strategy had outmaneuvered him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas knew very well that he had lost this confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had lost completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He underestimated Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian said, "Since there are no objections, it's decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eric, report to the publicity department tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian dismissed Eric's pale demeanor and took his place at the conference table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent under his commanding gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, Brian addressed the group, "I'm sure you're all wondering why I started Transcendent Construction Group for the Weston project."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, everyone nodded curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Thomas and Eric looked at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without explanation, Brian distributed the signed partnership agreement with Aria. "Here's the cooperation agreement. You'll understand once you read it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at the contents of the cooperation agreement with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they finished reading it, shock and realization spread through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally grasped Brian's strategy, which had been in motion since Kevin's arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The investment promotion conference was a calculated move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was to eliminate internal threats, clean up the workplace, and give everyone a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second reason was to save the company's costs to a greater extent and secure fifty percent of the project's profits for free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Trillion Group directly took this project out, no matter which company took it over, he wouldn't get the fifty percent profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's plan was a masterstroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were shocked and impressed by Brian's methods and layout, they also felt a little more awe for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Thomas and Eric were impressed by his methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was even more terrifying than they imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian resolved to align himself with Brian, the formidable new chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, Brian had another motive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to take revenge on Sophia and Ryan and make them regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Celeste was aware of Brian's plan, she remained impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had underestimated him for too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she prepared to praise him, the shareholders and executives beat her to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Brian with eyes full of admiration and worship and spoke attentively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, you're truly wise and intelligent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your strategy is impressive. I admire you very much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I believe Trillion Group will thrive under your leadership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Thomas' expression looked extremely complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gathered these shareholders and senior executives to deal with Brian and put pressure on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now they had become his supporters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he really lost miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled, stretched out his hands, and pressed them down slightly, and the scene suddenly became quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sipped his coffee leisurely, smiling at the crowd. "I heard Celeste mention that you're all eager to find me something. Let's hear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the crowd looked at each other, not knowing how to respond for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had all been summoned by Thomas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian turned to Thomas and smiled, "Thomas, since you've called everyone here, why not share what's on your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, everyone's eyes fell on Thomas.</span></p></div>
