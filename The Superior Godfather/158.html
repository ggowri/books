        <h1>Chapter 158 A Taste of Desire</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian panicked. "Velmara, don't&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even finish, Velmara leaned in and kissed him, silencing whatever protest he had with those soft, irresistible lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a wave of unfamiliar warmth and softness hit Brian. Her lips were so smooth, so velvety&mdash;they felt like jello, cool and bouncy, utterly intoxicating. He felt his thoughts blur for a moment, swept up by the taste of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to pull back, she grabbed his hand and pressed it against her full, smooth, and delicate breasts. That overwhelming softness spread through his palm and raced across his whole body, making his breath hitch. His body reacted almost instantly, heat flooding through him and an intense, primal urge welling up from deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara's breasts were huge&mdash;soft, plush, and unbelievably springy to the touch. The sensation was like nothing he'd ever felt before, and it set every nerve in his body ablaze. Blood surged, and he felt himself growing painfully hard in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she sensed the heat in Brian's hand and the way his body was responding, her delicate face lit up with a dazed, blissful smile. A soft moan slipped from her lips. "Ah... Mr. Edwards..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time Velmara experienced Brian's gentle caress. Like Zoe, she had always been head over heels for him. She wanted to give everything she had to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brian had always seen Velmara as just a kid, treating her like a little sister. He'd never even considered her that way, let alone touched her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Zoe gave her the push she needed that Velmara found the courage to take this step and finally put herself out there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vel&mdash; mm... ngh..." Brian started to speak again, but Velmara slipped her soft, sweet tongue into his mouth before he could get the words out, swirling it around with surprising boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was overwhelming. He couldn't hold back a low, pleasure-filled groan. Velmara was just so soft. Her tongue moved like melting jelly, warm, slick, and teasing, wrapping around his own, making him feel like he was about to lose control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nngh... mm..." Brian moaned again, the sound muffled but full of heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara caught the sound of his voice, and her lips curved slightly, a surge of quiet triumph blooming inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He might be saying no, but his body's telling a whole different story. Guess you're not as composed as you pretend to be, Mr. Edwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spurred on, Velmara got even bolder. Her hands moved fast as she guided Brian's palm down to her thigh, where it pressed against the sheer fabric of her white stockings. The second he touched her there, a unique texture met his skin and sent another jolt through him. He couldn't help it&mdash;his hand started moving on its own, exploring and caressing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when things were about to escalate, a sharp knock rang out from the door, followed by a woman's voice. "Brian, you home? Come open up. If you don't, I'm coming in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden interruption jolted both Brian and Velmara back to reality. Their bodies froze. The tension drained from their limbs as they pulled apart, breathless and dazed, chests rising and falling in heavy gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes lingered on her disheveled clothes and the way her chest rose and fell with each breath, threatening to spill out. He took a steadying breath, trying to keep his composure, and said in a low voice, "Fix your clothes. I've got company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara pouted, clearly annoyed, and a wave of frustration and disappointment welled up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously? I was this close to reeling Mr. Edwards in, and someone just had to show up now? Ugh, talk about ruining the mood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian chuckled softly at Velmara's reaction and then reached out to ruffle her hair. After wiping the lipstick from his lips with a handkerchief, he headed to the door and opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing outside was Celeste, dressed in a crisp white uniform that gave her a sharp, professional look with just the right amount of allure. Brian raised an eyebrow, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. "Celeste? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Brian a slightly aggrieved look and huffed, "I needed your help with something. You weren't at the office, and you didn't pick up your phone, so I had no choice but to come over myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh... I was entertaining a guest at home this morning. I was planning to head in this afternoon," Brian replied with a sheepish smile as he stepped aside to let Celeste in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Celeste caught sight of Velmara sitting at the dining table, she paused, visibly taken aback. A spark of admiration crossed Celeste's face as she reached out to gently pat the girl's head. "Aww, what a cute little girl. Is she your friend's kid, Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nearly facepalmed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What? This is Velmara we're talking about. She's the infamous Lord of Wealth and the top hacker in the world. And Celeste thinks she's just some random kid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara's face scrunched up in irritation. She slapped Celeste's hand away, stood up, and glared at her with obvious displeasure. "Excuse you. I'm not some kid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was one thing Velmara couldn't stand, it was being treated like a child, especially in front of Brian. If Celeste wasn't one of his friends, she would've already taught her a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a little insecure about her height, Velmara stood on her tiptoes. Celeste was around 5 feet 8, while she barely hit 5 feet 1. Even standing on tiptoe, Velmara couldn't match her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, she climbed up onto a chair, hands on her hips, chest puffed out, and stared down at Celeste with defiance. "Take a good look. Do I look like a kid to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but laugh at Velmara's fiery little stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste blinked, finally realizing she'd said something wrong. She quickly tried to apologize. "Sorry, I didn't mean&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara cut her off mid-sentence, "I'll let it slide this time for Brian's sake. But you better watch yourself. If you ever say that again, don't blame me for what happens next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished, she flicked her hand sharply. A blast of white energy then surged forward and ripped straight through the floor, leaving a five-foot-long gash in the tiles.</span></p></div>
