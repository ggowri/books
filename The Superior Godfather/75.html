        <h1>Chapter 75 I Love You!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the Master of the War Deities?" Upon hearing this, Anne couldn't help but sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, are you joking? Do you think this is some kind of joke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Anne's disbelief, Brian continued, "I'm not lying! I truly am the Master of the War Deities. If you don't believe me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anne cut him off before he could finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, enough! Whether you leave Riverwood or not, I've told you this. From now on, your fate is none of my concern."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Anne was both exasperated and furious with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, he still dared to joke around. She shot Brian a glare and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had said all and didn't care whether he lived or died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Anne walk away, a warm feeling rose in Brian's heart. He hadn't expected her to come and deliver this news in the middle of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be she was actually worried about him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled, quickly caught up to her, and wrapped his arms around her from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You came here to tell me this. Were you worried about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's body stiffened, unsure of how to respond. She should hate him and wish he was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her interactions with him over this period had stirred up confusing emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had taken her a long time to muster the courage to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so concerned about me, let me take care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she spoke, Brian's hands reached up to her breasts and began to knead them gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense sensation left her breathless, her body trembling with weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to resist, Brian took her earlobe into his mouth and started teasing her. It was one of her body's most sensitive areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation caused her to emit a soft sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat at her backside made her instinctively move, her hips shifting within the tight jeans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her hips swayed, she could feel the growing heat and pressure, her senses clouded as she drifted deeper into desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, she reached out with her hands, feeling the heat and intensity as she grasped it, a sense of deep fulfillment inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held it gently, her movements soft as she brushed against her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She longed to slip off her jeans and feel its heat, but Brian held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The friction of her hips, encased in jeans, brought a unique sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What captivated him most was Anne's expression, a mix of longing and unfulfilled desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forcefully turned her head, capturing her lips in a passionate kiss. His tongue met hers in a heated, warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat of the kiss left Anne breathless, her eyes locking onto Brian with increasing desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I want..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she could no longer hold back her longing. She knelt and took it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anne's touch, Brian breathed rapidly and let out satisfied moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of his moan, like the most exquisite music, deepened her obsession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't wait to take off her suspenders and underwear, and used her soft breasts to tightly clamp it together, stroking it while licking and sucking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing Anne's deeply focused and tireless demeanor, and feeling that surge, Brian couldn't suppress a startled gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to experience the allure of the enigmatic part of Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he lifted Anne and carried her to the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was already ablaze with desire, her smoldering gaze locked onto Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want it... Fuck me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reached to remove her jeans, Brian intervened once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Anne's figure, accentuated by her jeans, was so alluring, he couldn't bring himself to undo this layer of constraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please fuck me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's eyes shimmered with allure, and her gaze toward Brian was filled with silent pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, don't rush."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian swallowed nervously. As Anne gasped in surprise, his fingers sliced through her jeans, revealing the mysterious area adorned with a black thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne had not anticipated that Brian possessed such a skill, and her emotions grew increasingly stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't hesitate at all, raised her legs, and directly rushed into the depths that were already extremely wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Anne was filled with an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love you!"</span></p></div>
