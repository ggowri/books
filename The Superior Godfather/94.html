        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr... Mr. Edwards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Raven saw Brian clearly, his heart dropped, and a cold sweat broke out across his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of the last time Brian had beaten him senseless, followed by Zoe's punishment, flashed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled uncontrollably from the sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could react, Raven collapsed to his knees in front of Brian, too scared to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards... I didn't know it was you. I didn't mean to offend you. Please, I'm begging you. Punish me however you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, we're sorry for the trouble," Raven's men stammered, their faces drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all witnessed what Brian was capable of at the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody dared to cross him, not even their leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are they apologizing to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen stared in disbelief, her mouth hanging open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd never imagined that Raven and his men would react like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was starting to believe that everything Brian had said about his power was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flood of thoughts rushed through her mind as she looked at Brian, who suddenly seemed like a complete mystery to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was just as stunned. He stared at Raven in shock, unable to believe what he was seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Knox, why are you apologizing to this bastard? You're the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Dylan could finish, Raven slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up and apologize to Mr. Edwards right now, or you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was still in shock, his hand on his stinging cheek, struggling to grasp what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth to argue, but Raven grabbed him and shoved him toward Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, please... we're sorry. We didn't mean any disrespect. Please forgive us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian sat down calmly in a chair, looking down at them with a cool, almost detached gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My friend owes him 20 million dollars. I'm here to pay it off. After I gave him 86 million dollars, he still had the nerve to ask my friend to entertain him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm letting you off the hook for Zoe's sake, but how you deal with this is up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe what Dylan had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Dylan had crossed the line, and there was no going back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of rage, Raven grabbed Dylan by the collar and snarled, "Is everything Mr. Edwards said true? Did you really do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan hesitated, his face ashen, then reluctantly nodded. "Mr. Knox, I just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your damn mouth! If you want to die, don't drag me into it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Raven's fist slammed into Dylan's face, knocking him off balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from Dylan's mouth, and his face started to swell. He staggered back, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Knox, what the hell are you doing? This guy's just a..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Dylan could finish his sentence, Raven drove a knife straight into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's eyes widened in disbelief as he looked up at Raven, unable to comprehend what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's expression was cold as he stabbed him again, finishing him off with a brutal final blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's gaze swept over the room, and his voice dropped cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen carefully. Mr. Edwards is an honored guest of Shadow Fang. Anyone who dares show him disrespect will end up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" the group responded quickly, fear evident in their voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven nervously stepped forward, offering a bank card with a forced smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. My men made a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please accept this as a small token of my apology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't even glance at the card, his expression remaining unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's smile faltered for a second before he quickly shifted his attention to Karen, holding the card out to her instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Edwards, I truly apologize for today's events. Please, accept this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen blinked, completely taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce, feared Raven was now acting like a servant in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to her surprise, he thought she was Brian's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks turned pink, and she could feel her heart race as she processed everything that was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't take it, I won't leave until you do," Raven insisted, his hand still holding the card out, his face desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a helpless sigh, Karen took the card. "Alright, I'll take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stood up, his demeanor calm and emotionless as he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen quickly followed, still trying to wrap her mind around the whirlwind of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care, Mr. Edwards!" Raven said, his voice dripping with politeness as he quickly escorted them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they were out of sight, he exhaled deeply, his whole body relaxing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just narrowly escaped a deadly situation.</span></p></div>
