        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Breaking up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's face turned ghostly pale as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick nodded firmly. "That's right. We're done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Eleanor could explain, Patrick turned and walked away with Olivia and Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick, I know I was wrong. I'll never do it again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick, I swear I'll change. I'll be a good wife and mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's face crumpled as she rushed after him, desperately grabbing his hand and begging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, we're done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's face turned cold as he yanked his arm away, sending Eleanor tumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick didn't even glance at her as he walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick... no... no..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor watched their retreating figures and burst into uncontrollable sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had worked so hard to win Patrick's heart and gain Paul and Olivia's approval to marry into the wealthy Smith family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were supposed to get engaged next month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her dream had been within reach. Still, she never imagined her mockery of Brian would lead to such a devastating outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, her dreams of marrying into high society shattered utterly, and years of careful planning went down the drain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is all Brian's fault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That good-for-nothing Brian ruined everything. None of this would have happened if it weren't for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's face twisted with hatred as she blamed everything on Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was utterly blind to the fact that she had brought this all upon herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she pulled out her phone and called her best friend, Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to find out what the deal was with that damn Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call connected quickly, and Sophia's voice came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey Eleanor, what made you call suddenly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's face was bitter. She hesitated before saying, "Sophia, I... Patrick broke up with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news shocked Sophia, who was hiding out in a slum somewhere in Poskon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? Weren't you two getting engaged next month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just arrived in Poskon when a friend scammed her, and then she got robbed. Now, she was completely broke and living in misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all because of that bastard Brian..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor explained everything that had happened, ending with, "Sophia, you have to help me get justice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Sophia's face turned bitter. She could barely care for herself, let alone go up against Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless she managed to meet with Luna Sinclair, the leader of Cerberus Crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," she said firmly. "When I return from Poskon, I'll ensure that bastard Brian gets what he deserves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Poskon?" Eleanor was startled. "What are you doing there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Carter family is finished. Brian, that piece of trash, set Ryan up and got him killed. I'm in Poskon to find Ryan's mother and avenge him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor's face turned pale with shock. "What did you say? The Carter family is finished, and Brian killed Ryan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia nodded and gave her a quick rundown of what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, Ryan's mother runs the Cerberus Crew in Poskon. I'll be back on top if I can meet her and get her approval. Then I'll crush that bastard Brian under my heel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor was stunned to learn that Ryan's mother was the head of the Poskon Cerberus Crew!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Sophia could win her support, her status would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she said, "I believe in you, Sophia. If you need anything, just ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's eyes lit up, and she spoke after hesitating, "Eleanor, I got robbed recently, and I'm in desperate need of money. Could you lend me some if it's not too much trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much do you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Sophia replied, "Ten million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have that much on hand right now," Eleanor said without missing a beat. "But hang on, I'll figure out how to get it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll wire it to you by three o'clock this afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great, I'll be waiting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Eleanor's guarantee, Sophia let out a long breath of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this money, she could triumphantly overcome her immediate crisis, find Luna, and return home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that time came, she would make Brian pay double for all the misfortune she had endured.</span></p></div>
