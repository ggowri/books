        <h1>Chapter 15 A Night of Passion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's heart raced as his eyes took in Zoe's seductive form. Her noble, alluring face, the soft curve of her breasts barely covered by black silk, and her long, shapely legs made his pulse quicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, touch me," Zoe whispered, pulling his hands to her chest and urging him to explore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Master, you're incredible. Your hands are so warm... so strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe breathed, her eyes filled with desire. Her face was a picture of pleasure as she surrendered completely to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped her arms around his head, pressing his face into her chest, and Brian felt his body heat rise as his desires fully ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he pushed Zoe onto the sofa, kissing her passionately, savoring the sweetness of her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands roamed over her body, gently teasing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm... oh... Master..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's breath became shallow, her hands quickly working to unbuckle his belt. With a greedy eagerness, she grasped him, her movements slow at first but growing bolder with each passing second. She began to suck him gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... my..." Brian groaned, the pleasure overwhelming him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's enthusiasm grew as she took him deeper, her actions more urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, she took him deep into her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was unlike anything Brian had ever felt. He couldn't hold back, thrusting into her mouth, feeling himself tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, his body tensed as he reached his peak, releasing himself in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, you're incredible! I want more," Zoe murmured, licking her lips, her eyes gleaming with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, still feeling the heat of the moment, swallowed hard, watching her with an intensity that reignited his need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smiled, pulling down her neckline to reveal her breasts, pressing them against him, moving her body to create friction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pleasure surged through Brian, leaving him gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted Zoe in his arms and carried her to the large window, positioning her against the glass with her hips raised enticingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he admired the night view outside, he enjoyed Zoe's body. His movements grow more forceful with each passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room filled with the sounds of their passionate embrace, Zoe's moans echoing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a Rolls-Royce Phantom glided through the city streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Anastasia sat back, gazing out the window with a soft smile on her lips, lost in the memory of her time with Brian earlier that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the rare happiness on her face, Kale couldn't help but ask, "Ms. Vaughn, what's got you so happy? Is it because of Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she replied, still smiling. "He surprised me today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia stretched lazily, slipping off her high heels, and her full curves shifted beneath her clothes, almost spilling out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full, perky breasts bounced with the movement, almost straining against her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A surprise?" Kale raised an eyebrow. "What kind of surprise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Brian was just a loser who had lost his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's smile deepened as she recalled the evening's events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shared what had happened, and Kale's expression turned to one of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean... his energy has come back? And Ms. Guzman of Shadow Fang is his subordinate? She was that... gentle with him?" Kale stammered, still in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible," he added, shaking his head. "Everyone knows she's cold, ruthless, and proud."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's smile widened, amused by his astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw it with my own eyes. How could it be anything but true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale frowned, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she's a gang leader. How is she his subordinate? Does Brian have a past in the underworld?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia paused, thinking for a moment before replying, "I don't know... but one thing is clear. Brian has secrets&mdash;many secrets we don't know about. There's so much we haven't figured out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned forward, her voice soft but firm. "Get someone to look into his past. Do it quietly and thoroughly. Make sure he doesn't catch on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kale's expression turned serious, and he nodded. "Understood, Ms. Vaughn. I'll take care of it immediately."</span></p></div>
