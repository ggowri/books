        <h1>Chapter 96 Assassination</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By evening, Anastasia arrived at Brian's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked every bit the epitome of grace, dressed in a delicate light blue backless gown that made her tall, curvaceous frame look even more stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elegant fit of the dress enhanced her beauty, while the exposed skin along her back gave her an alluring, almost irresistible aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she stepped inside, the delicious aroma wafting from the kitchen hit her senses, making her stomach growl in anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, it smells amazing... What are you cooking today, Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll find out soon enough..." he teased, before glancing at her with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, where's Eliza? It's just you tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia set her LV bag down on the coffee table and gave him a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking about Eliza? You've got your eye on her, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow, maintaining his serious demeanor. "Well, Eliza's definitely beautiful, confident, and full of charm... But I think I prefer your type."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Anastasia leaned back on the couch, crossing her legs as she smiled at him. "And what kind of type do you think I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's gaze lingered for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure and replied, "To me, you're like a queen, elegant and stunning, decisive and bold, with a sharp mind and a deep, fascinating personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can come off as cold and unapproachable, but in reality, you're easy to talk to and incredibly understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's smile grew, and she leaned in slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't realize you had such high praise for me. Are you sure you're not just flattering me to get on my good side?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian quickly raised his hand, looking serious. "I swear, it's all true. No flattery here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow. "Well, if you want to know my thoughts on you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian chuckled, a wry smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a divorced man, so I'm guessing your opinion of me isn't exactly glowing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia rested her elbow on her knee, cupping her chin with her hand, giving him an alluring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've met a lot of young, successful men. Compared to them, you're nothing extraordinary... Maybe even a little ordinary. But in my eyes, you're the most handsome and the one with the most potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe in you, and I really hope one day we can be more than just friends. So... you better start working harder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flashed him a playful wink, making it even harder for Brian to keep his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wink was irresistibly seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt a rush of heat flood through him, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, he responded, "Don't worry. I'll do my best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the moment hung in the air, a chilling voice suddenly pierced through the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you're about to die, and you're still here flirting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice caught both Brian and Anastasia off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their eyes turned toward the source, two black-clad assassins dropped from the upstairs balcony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been waiting in Brian's bedroom, planning to strike once he was resting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing him not only cooking dinner but also entertaining a guest was more than they could tolerate. So, they decided to reveal themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes narrowed as he stared coldly at the two men. "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to take your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the two assassins lunged forward, their knives aimed straight for Brian's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so fast that they seemed like shadows, their daggers slicing through the air with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, they're fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's instincts kicked in. He swiftly sidestepped, evading their strikes, and in the same fluid motion, he planted his hands on the couch and delivered a powerful kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two assassins barely managed to block, crossing their arms in front of them, but the force of his strike sent them flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could regain their footing, Brian appeared in front of them like a blur. With one swift, forceful movement, he slammed both palms into their chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed out as they were sent flying across the room, crashing into the walls with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men lay on the ground, pale and gasping, their faces filled with shock and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intelligence had made them believe Brian was a weakling, but now they realized just how wrong they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The intel was wrong. Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, they turned and leapt for the window, intending to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can leave that easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes flashed with cold determination. Like a predator on the hunt, he charged after them without hesitation.</span></p></div>
