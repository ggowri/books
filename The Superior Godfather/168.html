        <h1>Chapter 168 Karen's Crisis</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was in high spirits as he cruised back home, whistling a jaunty tune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he hadn't sealed the deal with Celeste, but their chemistry had undeniably heated up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that moment when he finally got to touch her legs? That was like pure magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste wasn't just stunning. Her figure, her poise, and those legs... They were perfection. The memory of their silky smoothness under his fingers was enough to keep him grinning, replaying the sensation like a favorite song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in his thoughts, he barely noticed the road. Suddenly, a black Toyota Alphard barreled past, splashing through a puddle with reckless speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dirty water sprayed through his open window, soaking him in an instant. Worse, the driver lobbed a mess of trash and a liquor bottle out their window, which smashed into Brian's windshield, leaving a gaping hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sleek Ferrari, once a head-turner, now looked like it had been through a warzone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's good mood evaporated, his face darkening with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of a..." he muttered, slamming his foot on the gas to give chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever these jerks were, their arrogance and utter lack of respect had crossed a line. Brian wasn't about to let it slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to teach them a lesson, especially since this wasn't even his car. Celeste had lent it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Toyota, five burly men in black, reeking of booze, leered at Karen with undisguised greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was a vision. She was gorgeous, with a figure and aura that turned heads wherever she went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bound tightly with ropes, her curves were accentuated, her full chest straining against her blouse, exuding a mature, magnetic allure that was almost too much to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men were practically drooling, their eyes locked on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't been handpicked by their boss, they'd have already made their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the temptation was overwhelming. They couldn't resist sneaking in a few gropes here and there, just enough to get their fix without crossing the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swallowing hard, they exchanged eager glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who... Who are you people? What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen's voice trembled, her body shrinking under their predatory stares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been job-hunting lately, and today, after a promising interview, she'd been ambushed and kidnapped on her way home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, sweetheart," one of them sneered. "You're our boss' prize. We're not gonna hurt you... just gonna have a little fun with our hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinning, the five men reached for her, their fingers aiming for her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the van screeched to a halt, the sudden stop nearly throwing them off their seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hector, what the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Willy Irwin, the leader, barked at the driver, his face twisted with irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It ain't me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector Natt shot back, glaring out the windshield. "Some guy in a Ferrari's boxed us in on the bridge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded toward Brian, who was stepping out of his battered car, looking anything but pleased. "Looks like he's pissed about the bottle and trash we chucked. Smashed up his ride, and now he's here to settle the score."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Willy and his crew scoffed, their faces souring. "So what? We trashed his car. Big deal. He wanna die over it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, however, felt a surge of hope, her eyes lighting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recognized him instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth to scream for help, but Willy was faster, slapping a strip of duct tape over her lips. Her muffled cries were desperate, but no sound escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Willy's eyes gleamed with malice as he turned to two of his goons. "You two, go deal with him. Make it quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it," they grunted, grabbing machetes and swaggering out of the van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes narrowed as he spotted them, his finger jabbing toward his wrecked windshield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, what's your deal? You drive like idiots, splash me with muck, and then chuck garbage and a bottle at my car? You're paying for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, easy, buddy," one of the goons said, his voice dripping with fake remorse. "Total accident, swear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a flash, their smirks vanished. They swung their machetes down hard, smashing the rest of Brian's windows into a shower of glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a backward glance, they slung their blades over their shoulders and sauntered off, dismissing Brian like he was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't notice the storm brewing in his expression, his jaw tightening with barely contained rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they strutted away, Brian's voice cut through the air. "Hey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men paused, scowling as they turned back, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A split second later, they were staring down two massive fists hurtling toward their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was brutal, blood spraying from their mouths as they stumbled back, dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could recover, Brian was on them, leaping forward with a vicious roundhouse kick. His boots connected with their faces, the force sending them crashing into the side of the Toyota like cannonballs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bones shattered, organs ruptured, and they slumped to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't spare a shred of mercy for scum like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit! Everyone, get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Willy and the remaining goons were stunned, their bravado crumbling at the sight of their fallen friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They piled out of the van, machetes raised, charging at Brian like a pack of rabid wolves, ready to tear him apart.</span></p></div>
