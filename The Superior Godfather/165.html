        <h1>Chapter 165 A Dazzling Drift</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft, trembling moan escaped Celeste's lips as Brian's </span><span>touch</span><span> sent a shiver through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, she pressed her thighs together, her breath catching in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Th</span><span>at</span><span> only intensified the sensation for Brian</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>H</span><span>er legs envelop</span><span>ed</span><span> his hand in a soft grip. Unable to resist, he gave a gentle squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's body quivered as a wave of heat surged from her thigh, radiating through her entire being. Her breathing grew ragged, her ears </span><span>burning</span><span>, and her limbs </span><span>turning into jelly</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd never experienced anything like this before. Her heart pounded so fiercely it might leap out of her chest. </span><span>S</span><span>he opened her mouth, </span><span>gasping</span><span> for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian... </span><span>stop</span><span>... Please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breathless plea</span><span> and</span><span> flushed state </span><span>just made</span><span> Brian's </span><span>smirk grow</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Celeste to be so sensitive. A mere touch to her thigh and she already </span><span>couldn't take it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of pulling away, he </span><span>went deeper.</span><span> </span><span>H</span><span>is fingers knead</span><span>ed</span><span> lightly, relishing the friction between his palm and the silky texture of her stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's </span><span>body softened</span><span> under his touch. Her tightly clamped thighs gradually </span><span>gave</span><span> way to his gentle persistence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's grin widened, a surge of smug satisfaction bubbling in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emboldened, his hand began to wander</span><span>. It</span><span> glid</span><span>ed</span><span> along the inner curve of her thigh</span><span> and inched</span><span> upward with deliberate slowness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers brushed closer to the hem of her skirt, </span><span>catching a</span><span> glimpse of purple lace </span><span>underneath</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp, involuntary moan slipped from Celeste's lips as her body trembled under the overwhelming sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was melting like ice cream in July under Brian's touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to tell him to stop, but her body </span><span>was </span><span>too weak to muster the strength to push him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, a sharp honk from outside the window snapped both of them </span><span>back to reality.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste </span><span>finally</span><span> summon</span><span>ed</span><span> just enough strength to shove Brian's hand away. She </span><span>gasped</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> fresh air</span><span> </span><span>as she tried to steady herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian</span><span> looked disappointed. He</span><span> shot a glance at the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, a Mercedes was blaring its horn at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian </span><span>ignored it and </span><span>focused on </span><span>driving</span><span>, but the Mercedes surged forward, pulling up alongside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the car, five </span><span>punk kids</span><span> with </span><span>dyed</span><span> hair started banging on their window and whistling at </span><span>Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, gorgeous, you're a stunner! Wanna be friends?" one of them catcalled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yo, dude, your girl's got a killer body. Let us borrow her for a bit, huh?" another jeered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face twisted with disgust</span><span> and</span><span> contempt. Without hesitation, she flipped the bird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian followed suit</span><span> </span><span>as he barked, "Fuck off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he slowly rolled up the window and slammed the gas pedal to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ferrari SF90 roared to life, its raw power unleashed in a blur of red. Like a bolt of lightning, the car surged forward, </span><span>quickly putting</span><span> a hundred yards </span><span>between them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, catch that guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punks in the Mercedes weren't about to back down. Scowling, they floored it, determined to keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian </span><span>caught </span><span>them in the mirror</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>He smirked</span><span> with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on tight," he said to Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could respond, the Ferrari surged again, barreling toward a sharp curve ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the stunned gasps of the Mercedes crew, the Ferrari hit the turn with a jaw-dropping drift</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>I</span><span>ts tires screech</span><span>ed</span><span> as it swung into a perfect slide. The car vanished around the bend, leaving the punks gaping in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only one thought echoed in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That was some badass driving. Holy hell, what a slick drift!</span></p></div>
