        <h1>Chapter 150 Lord of Wealth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mr. Edwards. I'll inform Velmara right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Zoe made her way to the room of Velmara, the Lord of Wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Velmara was lounging in a chair, munching on crispy potato chips while gazing with great interest at over a dozen large screens on the computer desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On these screens were displayed market trend charts covering all aspects of the financial field, such as stocks and funds, virtual currencies, foreign exchange bonds, banking and insurance, real estate properties, and so on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These complex and dazzling trend charts, along with various data, were a breeze for Velmara. With chips in hand, she calmly issued various commands in the chat group via her mobile phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Lord of Wealth in charge of the War Deities' funds, Velmara had unparalleled financial acumen, and she was the world's top-notch hacker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Velmara, Mr. Edwards has a task for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Upon hearing Zoe's words, Velmara tossed aside the potato chips in her arms and excitedly flung herself into Zoe's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, tell me what the task is. I'm so bored..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe relayed the task assigned by Brian to Velmara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Zoe's account, Velmara said disappointedly, "I thought it would be an important task. Turns out it's a task without any challenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up her phone and sent a voice message to the chat group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Here's a task for you all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within one hour, pull up the stock price of the Anastasia Group and bring down the Glory Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon receiving the message, the group immediately became abuzz with activity, and people responded enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Got it, Velmara!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[We promise to get the job done.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Velmara, you're underestimating us. This task won't even take an hour.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Brian's villa, Anastasia hastened to the Anastasia Group to meet up with Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliza, how's the situation now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza pointed at the stock-price trend chart of the Anastasia Group on the computer screen and said, "Ms. Vaughn, our company's stock price has dropped from 150 dollars per share to 102 dollars, and it's still on the decline...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If no measures are taken, it'll soon fall below one hundred dollars..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Eliza could finish her words, the stock price of the Anastasia Group had already dipped below one hundred dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at the continuously dropping stock price data, Anastasia was deeply concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She issued several commands in rapid succession and then took out her phone to make several calls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not only did the downward trend of the company's stock price not halt, but the rate of decline actually accelerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At present, both institutional investors and retail investors in the market were engaged in a massive sell-off of the Anastasia Group's stocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there weren't sufficient funds to buy back these stocks, the stock price would continue to plummet. Unfortunately, she had no available funds now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, her phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a call from Denzel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, what has happened to your company? Why is the stock price dropping so precipitously? Do you need any help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel was standing in front of a large floor-to-ceiling window, overlooking Riverwood, the bustling city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sexy secretary wearing black stockings and high-heeled shoes was kneeling before him, doing her utmost to please him with her mouth, providing him with a sense of pleasure and satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia said, "Thanks for your concern, but I can handle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Anastasia's response, Denzel sneered, "Anastasia, you've always been so proud. But this is a critical moment. Don't be stubborn. If this continues, all your hard work over the years will be in vain. We're family. As long as you ask for help, I'll assist you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, but I can solve this issue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia coldly hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew exactly what Denzel was up to, but under no circumstances would she yield to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, I'm looking forward to seeing how long you can hold out and what solutions you can come up with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the hung-up phone, Den</span><span>zel wore a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he gave instructions to Victor, who was standing behind him, "Victor, tell them to intensify the attack. I'm curious to see how long Anastasia can last."</span></p></div>
