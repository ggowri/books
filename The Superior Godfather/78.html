        <h1>Chapter 78 Stunned</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Ryan's words, Zoe couldn't help but burst into laughter, looking at him as if he were a corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is this the talented cousin Sam was bragging about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That idiot recommended this clown to the Master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan had expected Zoe to be intimidated by his cousin's name, but seeing her laugh threw him off balance, leaving him momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what are you laughing at?" he stammered, confusion etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe regarded him with a playful glint in her eyes. "I'm laughing at your ignorance. Do you even know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan raised an eyebrow, his voice dripping with skepticism. "And who might that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Zoe Guzman, the president of Shadow Fang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's eyes widened in shock. "You're the president of Shadow Fang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, everything clicked for him. He suddenly understood why Raven hadn't eliminated Brian and had instead been furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because he hadn't realized that Brian was acquainted with the notorious leader of the Shadow Fang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ryan quickly regained his composure, looking down at Zoe with disdain. "Sure, Shadow Fang may rule the underworld of Riverwood, but compared to the War Deities, it's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not wrong; Shadow Fang can't hold a candle to the War Deities. But I have another title..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's smile turned icy as she locked her gaze on Ryan, her expression laced with mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That title is the leader of the Twelve Blades of the War Deities&mdash;Crimson Demonic Ascendance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even your cousin pales in comparison to me, got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face fell, disbelief washing over him as he stared at Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're the Crimson Demonic Ascendance, the leader of the Twelve Blades of the War Deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smirked. "What's the matter? Any issues with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Ryan was dumbfounded, but then a realization seemed to hit him, and he erupted into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha... Crimson Demonic Ascendance? What a joke of a title! I've never even heard of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They say birds of a feather flock together. Just a moment ago, that loser Brian claimed to be the Master of the War Deities, and now you're here saying you're the leader of the Twelve Blades... you're all cut from the same cloth, full of hot air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think you can scare me with this nonsense? I'll have my cousin come here and expose your true identities in front of everyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ryan pulled out his phone and dialed Sam's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, where are you? I'm at the restaurant, and I just got attacked! That bastard is openly pretending to be the Master of the War Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Just wait; I'll be there in a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Ryan turned his cold gaze back to Brian and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cousin will be here any minute. You two better brace yourselves for what's coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian ignored him, continuing to savor his meal, while Zoe respectfully poured him another glass of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Ryan, this scene was infuriating, making him feel like he could spit blood from sheer rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan!" Just then, Sam rushed in, his steps hurried and frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan exclaimed, relief washing over him, "Sam! You finally made it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at what they did to me! You have to help me out here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a mess, tears, and snot streaming down his face as he laid his troubles bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam froze, taken aback by Ryan's condition. His disbelief quickly morphed into a boiling rage. "What the hell happened? Which bastard turned you into this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Ryan pointed an accusing finger at Brian and Zoe. "Sam, it's these two damn scumbags!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They not only beat me up but are also openly pretending to be the Master of the War Deities and the leader of the Twelve Blades! You've got to expose them and take them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sam took in the two figures Ryan was pointing at, it was as if a thunderbolt had struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What kind of twisted mess is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did Ryan end up in a fight with the Master and that crazy woman Zoe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Sam felt utterly paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I tried to help you meet the Master, and you go and fight them, and now want me to deal with them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it! You're dragging me into a nightmare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat began to bead on Sam's forehead as he realized the cold, unyielding stare coming from Brian, matched by Zoe's bemused, almost mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm about to be ruined because of this idiot Ryan," he thought bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ryan was too caught up in his fury to notice Sam's distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned back to Brian and Zoe, his voice loud and filled with bravado. "Weren't you two just bragging about being the Master of the War Deities and the leaders of the Twelve Blades? What's the matter now? Speak up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ryan could finish, Sam slapped him across the face with enough force to send him spinning like a top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dazed, Ryan staggered and clutched his cheek, staring at Sam in shock. "Sam, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Ryan completely, Sam quickly stepped before Brian, bowing respectfully. "Master, I humbly greet you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've clearly failed to keep him in check. I beg for your punishment!"</span></p></div>
