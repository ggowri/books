        <h1>Chapter 84 A Strange Voice on the Phone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Karen's cries echo through the phone sent a tight knot of worry into Anne's stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been trying to pull some strings to help Karen secure a loan, but no one seemed able to cough up the 20 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stealing a glance at Brian, she took a deep breath and said, "Aunt Karen, don't panic! I'll figure something out for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just stay hidden and don't go home. Whatever you do, don't let those guys find you. I'll call you back shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Anne hesitated for a brief moment before turning to Brian. "Listen, Brian, I... I need to ask you for a favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow in confusion. "What's this about out of the blue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You remember my Aunt Karen, right? She lost her job because of you, and now she's in deep trouble&mdash;she owes 20 million dollars to loan sharks and can't pay it back. I want to borrow that amount to help her out; otherwise, those guys will grab her and sell her into... well, you know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne paused, gathering her thoughts. "I promise if you lend me the money, I'll find a way to pay you back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not happening," Brian said without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Karen was good-looking and had an amazing figure, Brian didn't have the slightest bit of affection for her and flat-out rejected Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was taken aback by his blunt refusal. She looked at him with pleading eyes. "Brian, I know she wasn't nice to you before, and I'm really sorry for that. Please, just help her this once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no sign of conceding, Brian remained stoic, so Anne decided to sweeten the deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She draped her arm around his and leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a softer, more appealing tone. "Please, Brian. I'm begging you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth from her touch sent shivers through him as he felt the incredible softness of her body against his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was losing his composure under the weight of her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for his reply, Anne hopped onto his lap, her body twisting seductively as she swayed her curvy hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh Brian, please just help me out, okay? Pretty please? I promise, I'll make it worth your while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into her imploring eyes, he felt a rush of desire. The friction ignited a fire in him that was hard to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed hard, trying to regain his voice. "Let her come to me. If her attitude improves, I might consider it," Brian stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You're the best! I love you for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Anne got so excited that she immediately threw her arms around Brian and pulled him into a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Brian's face was buried between Anne's ample bosoms, which were squished and distorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help thinking that this woman really had an incredibly voluptuous chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian felt like he was on the verge of suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick... let go of me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Brian's words, Anne finally came to her senses and realized her over-enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She released her hold on Brian's head, her cheeks flushing scarlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne couldn't bring herself to meet Brian's eyes. "Sorry... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her apology, Brian tilted her chin up and captured her lips in a passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His left arm snaked around her slender waist, while his right hand cupped one of her firm, full breasts and began to knead it gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... Mmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense stimulation made Anne let out a seductive moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound in Brian's ears only spurred him on, and his movements grew more and more rough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no longer content with groping her through the clothes. He quickly stripped Anne of her garments and took one of her already-hardened pink nipples into his mouth, sucking and teasing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense pleasure made Anne's eyes glaze over. Her hands began to caress Brian's broad, muscular back, and her voluptuous hips rubbed against his already rock-hard erection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she couldn't hold back any longer. She tugged at Brian's pants and dropped to her knees in front of him. Then Anne lowered her head and took his manhood into her mouth, savoring it tenderly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her movements quickened, Brian felt as if he was ascending to the clouds, bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Anne's phone rang. It was Karen calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to hang up, but Brian suddenly said, "Answer it and tell her to come over later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne hesitated for a moment, then picked up the phone and hit the answer button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, have you come up with a solution? Those loan sharks are scouring the whole town for me... I'm so scared. If they find me, I'm done for..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne was about to speak, Brian pushed her head down and moved it up and down rhythmically, creating a series of lewd sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian found this moment incredibly exciting, while Anne felt as if her heart was about to leap out of her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, what's going on over there? Can you hear me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the sounds on the phone, Karen frowned, a look of confusion flashing across her eyes.</span></p></div>
