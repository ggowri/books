        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Damian to cut ties with him so quickly and choose to stand with Brian so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Eric, he had made the most noise moments ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the weight of the crowd's gaze, Thomas forced a smile and said, "It's nothing serious, but Kevin's accident has significantly impacted the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted everyone to meet with the chairman to discuss a solution to mitigate the negative effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder what the chairman thinks about this matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then looked at Brian, eager to see how he would respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to see what he was capable of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian narrowed his eyes, sensing Thomas' intent to undermine him publicly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Celeste and said calmly, "Celeste, I recall discussing how to handle this. Please present your proposal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Edwards," Celeste replied, nodding as she distributed a prepared plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The proposal was straightforward, which was to issue a notice to the public and apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The content roughly openly acknowledged a series of facts, including Kevin's corruption and bribery, and repeatedly emphasized that Trillion Group had been actively carrying out internal rectification for better development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kevin incident was the attitude and result of the internal rectification of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that this cancer had been completely eradicated, the company would no longer have to worry and would fully embrace a new future and challenge new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd read the proposal, shock spread among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement not only acknowledged Kevin's wrongdoing but also demonstrated Trillion Group's accountability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, it also strengthened Trillion Group's future development and attitude, letting everyone outside know that Trillion Group was an excellent enterprise worthy of reliance and trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could foresee that once the announcement was made, all negative impacts on Trillion Group would disappear, and the falling stocks would rebound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Admiration for Brian swelled among the attendees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian exclaimed, "Mr. Edwards, your public relations strategy is brilliant! It not only salvages our image but elevates it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others echoed his sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Edwards, we're impressed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're fortunate to have you as our chairman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your leadership, Trillion Group is set to soar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many shareholders expressed their support for Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, we will no longer be involved in any of the company's affairs. You can do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, Mr. Edwards. Just go ahead and do it. We will unconditionally support any decision you make."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purpose of everyone investing in a company was to make profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They recognized his strength and skills, believing he would bring greater benefits as the head of Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the enthusiastic shareholders and executives, Eric's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated their swift change of heart in favor of Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, meanwhile, felt a mix of frustration and disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He originally wanted to take this opportunity to give Brian a difficult problem and embarrass him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never anticipated that he would not only devise a perfect solution but also earn the shareholders' high praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this moment on, Brian had firmly established his foothold in the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your trust. I will not disappoint you," Brian said, standing with a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure you're all tired after a long day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've booked a banquet and rooms at the Paradise Hotel, so let's go have a drink and relax."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone showed surprise and astonishment on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected such an arrangement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's interpersonal skills were impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste gazed at him, her eyes sparkling with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never expected that Brian had such an arrangement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gesture would dissipate the resentment of those who had waited for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were amazed by Brian's strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian smiled, increasingly impressed by Brian's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric clenched his fists, glaring at Brian in indignation. "This guy knows how to win people over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas looked at Brian with a mix of emotions, feeling an unfamiliar sense of fear toward someone so young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was frightening wasn't he showed off his talents but his ability to adapt and conceal his mistakes.</span></p></div>
