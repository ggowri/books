        <h1>Chapter 99 Partnership</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a VIP private room at the Kempinski Hotel, Thomas and Eric were staring at the anonymous invitation letter in their hands, both clearly puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The letter had promised to help them take full control of the Trillion Group and solve their current problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after showing up at the agreed time and place, no one was around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric looked unsure. "Thomas, we've been waiting here for a while with no sign of anyone. Do you think this could be a trick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Thomas could answer, the door to the private room suddenly swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their surprise, the hotel manager entered, escorting a young man with white hair and an older man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Denzel and Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel walked in confidently and took a seat at the head of the table, offering an apologetic smile to Thomas and Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My apologies for the delay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem," Thomas replied, his sharp eyes narrowing as he studied the men. "Why did you call us here today, and how should we address you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel was no ordinary person, and his calm demeanor only confirmed this to Thomas, who had met many influential figures in his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor, standing quietly behind Denzel, spoke up, "Allow me to introduce ourselves. This is Denzel Vaughn. I'm Victor Collins and I work for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victor, one of the top eight experts in Azuriath State?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Denzel, one of the five heirs of the Vaughn family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and Eric exchanged shocked looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vaughn family was the undisputed ruler of Azuriath State, a century-old family that towered over even the wealthiest elites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They controlled the entire region's economy and industries, essentially running the state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel, one of their five heirs, was a man of incredible influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that someone of Denzel's stature would be reaching out to them left Thomas and Eric in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly stood up, eager to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Vaughn and Mr. Collins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for formalities," Denzel said with a smile. "Please, sit down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasted no time and got straight to the point. "The reason I'm here is that I'd like to discuss a potential partnership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A partnership?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and Eric exchanged a brief glance before their faces lit up with excitement. "What kind of partnership are you proposing? How can we be of service to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could partner with Denzel and gain the Vaughn family's support, it would mean a leap to the top for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's tone shifted to something more serious. "For certain reasons, I can't act directly, so I need your help to take down the Trillion Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't let Anastasia be with Brian, nor could he allow Brian to double the value of the Trillion Group and regain his position as the heir of the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and Eric exchanged a look, a resigned smile spreading across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vaughn, the Trillion Group is doing well, booming even. Taking it down won't be a walk in the park... I doubt we have the means to pull it off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel smiled slightly, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Thomas Lee, you're being too modest. We all know you're one of the pillars of the Trillion Group, and you hold a lot of sway inside. Plus, I'll have Victor use the Vaughn family's resources to back you in the shadows...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you manage to take care of this, you'll be lifelong allies of the Vaughn family. I'll ensure you both live a life of luxury and ease, with wealth and power at your fingertips."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words stirred a deep excitement in Thomas and Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They immediately nodded with determination. "Mr. Vaughn, don't worry, we'll do whatever it takes to bring down the Trillion Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel took a leisurely sip of his wine, clearly entertained. "So, what's your plan from here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' face hardened as he responded, "Mr. Vaughn, I have access to key resources and information within the Trillion Group. I also have strong ties with many of the top executives and shareholders. With your support, I can persuade them to work for you, dismantle the company, and start something new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we've done that, the Group will be nothing more than an empty shell. With a little more effort, we can take it down completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel gave a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Let's go with your plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas hesitated for a moment. "But Mr. Vaughn, setting up a new company will require a lot of funds. We're a bit tight at the moment..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel waved it off, tossing a bank card onto the table with a casual motion. "Here's 10 billion dollars. Use it for now. If you need more, just ask Victor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and Eric were stunned. Gratefully, they bowed their heads. "Thank you, Mr. Vaughn! You can count on us. We won't let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel waved them away. "Go ahead and get started. I expect good news in a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won't disappoint you," Thomas promised, and with that, they quickly departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they left, Denzel turned to Victor with a mischievous smile. "Victor, what do you think? Do you think they'll pull it off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's reply was confident. "With you behind them, they should have no trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way," Denzel said, "how's the assassination going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's expression grew confident as he spoke, "The contract's been picked up by two of the best assassins from the Peerless Sect, Cole and Derek. They're well-known internationally. There shouldn't be any issues with them on the job..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Victor could finish, his phone rang. After taking the call, his face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vaughn, the assassination failed!"</span></p></div>
