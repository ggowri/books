        <h1>Chapter 129 Stabilizing the Situation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's announcement left the room in stunned silence. They stared at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A 20-thousand-dollar loyalty bonus for everyone who stayed? Half paid immediately, half with next month's salary? The rumors of the company's imminent bankruptcy suddenly seemed less credible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callian and his group, who had just insisted on resigning, shifted uncomfortably with growing regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had been wavering now decided to stay, looking at Brian with newfound admiration, even reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Edwards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian wore a warm smile. "It's nothing extraordinary. It's the least I could do. Now, if there's nothing else, you can return to work. Please spread the word to your colleagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone will handle the bonus distribution shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Edwards!" The crowd bowed respectfully before filing out, leaving only Callian and his group standing awkwardly in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian raised an eyebrow in feigned surprise. "Didn't you all have urgent family matters to attend to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, we..." Callian and the others fumbled for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 20-thousand-dollar bonus was a huge sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian cut them off with a wave. "Farrah, please show them out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way, everyone," Farrah said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callian's group departed, heads bowed in resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effect of Brian's announcement rippled through the company immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaos subsided as employees returned to their work, and true to his word, Brian had Celeste arrange for 20 armored trucks to deliver the cash bonuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe Mr. Edwards actually came through?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's like a miracle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to work harder&mdash;bosses like Mr. Edwards don't come along often. We can't let the company fail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of cash in hand transformed the employees' uncertainty into enthusiasm and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their commitment to their work redoubled, and the company's unity grew stronger than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Callian and his group could only watch from the outside, knowing their bridges were thoroughly burned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian couldn't contain his admiration at how effortlessly Brian had defused the crisis and stabilized the company. "Mr. Edwards, that was brilliant. Your approach was masterful&mdash;I'm truly impressed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the usually aloof Celeste praised him, "That was remarkable. I wonder how Thomas and his group will react when they hear their plan to watch us crumble has backfired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to admit, Brian's moves consistently surprised her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a simple tactic," Brian said nonchalantly. "But don't let your guard down. This crisis is just beginning. Once news of Thomas' group withdrawing their investment breaks, we'll face even greater challenges. Stay ready to respond."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused thoughtfully before adding, "Also, with Eric leading that mass exodus, we have numerous key positions to fill. We need to quickly identify trustworthy people for critical roles while recruiting new talent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled, "I started working on that last night, Mr. Edwards. It's under control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stood and stretched lazily. "Then I'll leave the rest to you. See you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stood up and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He headed for the door but paused, turning back to Celeste with an appreciative glance. "Ms. Hawthorne, that outfit today&mdash;very impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's smile turned playful as she crossed her stockinged legs, the black silk catching the light. "Then I'll see you tomorrow?" she said, winking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deliberate sensuality of her gesture made Brian's throat go dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll be here," he said. "Just surprise me."</span></p></div>
