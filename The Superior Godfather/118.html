        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pulling out your investment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement sent shockwaves through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Thomas in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he planning to withdraw from Trillion Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's expression changed at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Thomas serious about this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Thomas pulled his investment, Trillion Group's stock would nosedive quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zac couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Lee, are you serious? You're withdrawing from Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas nodded firmly. "That's right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, someone eagerly asked, "What are your plans after withdrawing, Mr. Lee?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They needed to prepare for what would come if Thomas pulled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Thomas replied, "I plan to start my own company. I've already obtained the business license. It's called Quadrillion Group, and its initial capital is fifteen billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Thomas held up the new company's business license for everyone to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at the business license in shock, their jaws dropping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them expected Thomas to move so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian narrowed his eyes and asked in a serious tone, "A registered capital of fifteen billion dollars? Thomas, as far as I know, all your money is tied up in the stock market. Where did you get such a huge sum?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to Thomas with curious expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas smiled slightly and explained, "I got five billion dollars through bank loans. The other ten billion dollars came from an investor named Denzel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Denzel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean Denzel Vaughn, one of the five heirs of the Vaughn family from Azuriath State?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes widened as they stared at Thomas in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew that Thomas was connected to someone as influential as Denzel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that the Vaughn family was among the elite of Azuriath State, with countless businesses nationwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel was one of the five heirs to the Vaughn family and the CEO of Glory Group. He was a man of extraordinary status and powerful connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's face showed pure amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe Thomas had convinced Denzel to invest and partner with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Denzel's backing, it seemed only a matter of time before this new corporation would overtake the Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching everyone's shocked expressions, Thomas felt smug as his smile grew wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, it's Mr. Denzel Vaughn! Mr. Vaughn prefers to keep a low profile, so I hope everyone can keep this under wraps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Thomas' confirmation, the crowd couldn't contain their excitement and started speaking up one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lee, is the Quadrillion Group still looking for shareholders and investors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lee, you promised to help us make money together. Can we buy some shares?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Mr. Lee, give us a chance to get in on this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas smiled at their reactions and said, "Everyone, calm down. Mr. Vaughn and I believe in sharing the wealth, so we plan to expand our shares for financing. If you're interested in the Quadrillion Group, you can register for investment through Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, the Quadrillion Group is currently recruiting talent. We welcome all of you to bring your teams and join us for better opportunities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the scene erupted into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget about me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lee, we're following your lead from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People rushed forward eagerly to register, turning the whole place into a complete frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this scene, Damian was stunned, unable to hold back a nervous gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined Thomas would play such a ruthless game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he withdrawing investments from the Trillion Group, but he also planned to gut it from the inside out, eradicating it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could already picture the mighty Trillion Group crumbling overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he felt his loyalty begin to waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should he stick with Brian or join Thomas in the rebellion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas noticed his hesitation and walked over, patting Damian's shoulder with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "So Damian, interested in joining my team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian took a deep breath and looked up at Thomas to steady his nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Thomas, I'm always careful about taking risks. Can you give me one night to think it over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time is of the essence here, but for old times' sake, I'll give you until nine tomorrow morning to decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas paused before adding, "And one more thing... everything discussed at tonight's meeting stays between us, understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, my lips are sealed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian nodded and took his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they watched him walk away, Eric couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thomas, why'd you let him go? Aren't you worried he'll run straight to Brian and Celeste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas let out a sneer, and his eyes flashed with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fall of Trillion Group is already set in stone. What difference does it make if they know?"</span></p></div>
