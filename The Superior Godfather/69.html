        <h1>Chapter 69 Take Responsibility!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Sophia's words, Ryan regained his composure and laughed heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha... Sophia is right! Once I join the War Deities and earn the Master's favor, Brian will still be nothing more than a waste in my eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan frowned slightly. "Join the War Deities? What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia smiled and explained, "Mr. Carter, Ryan's cousin, Sam, has returned. He was once the Unparalleled Blade of the Four Lords and Twelve Blades of the War Deities. Not long ago, he promised to recommend Ryan to the War Deities and help him join."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's face lit up with shock and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam lost his parents early and went abroad to make his way. Though I knew he was doing well overseas, I never expected him to join the War Deities and become the Unparalleled Blade of the Twelve Blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Sam's recommendation and Ryan's abilities, Ryan will definitely earn a spot with the War Deities and gain the Master's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, it will be easy to deal with that loser Brian and rescue me from here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan finished his words with a firm pat on Ryan's shoulder. "Ryan, you must seize this opportunity and make a good impression on the Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face lit up with excitement as he nodded seriously at Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, don't worry. I'll work hard to win the Master's approval, join the War Deities, take down Brian, and get you out of here. I'm sorry that you have to stay here for a while longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan looked at Ryan with a proud smile and said with a smile, "I believe in you! It's late. You should go back with Sophia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, we're leaving now! Don't worry, I'll get you out as soon as I can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan nodded slightly, then turned and left with Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, as the first rays of morning light poured through the window, Brian slowly woke from his sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at his bare chest, a flicker of confusion and doubt crossed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vaguely recalled Celeste helping him back to the room after the banquet last night, but had no memory of what transpired afterwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stretched and headed to the bathroom, only to be shocked by the sight of lipstick marks on his face and neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? What's with these lipstick marks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Celeste have taken advantage of my drunken state and slept with me last night?" Brian thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian carefully assessed his physical condition, furrowing his brows as his mind filled with questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it doesn't feel like anything happened. What is going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What actually happened last night after I got drunk?" Brian thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the doorbell rang, and Celeste walked in, her tall, sexy figure swaying in high heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dressed casually, with her hair tied into a high ponytail. She wore a red shirt and a dark blue denim skirt that perfectly complemented her tall, attractive figure, finished off with an LV handbag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes lit up. She had a different charm today and looked like the perfect mix of a sexy executive and a young girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a captivating smile, she looked at Brian with great interest. "How was your night? Did you sleep well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, but I blacked out and have no idea what happened later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stared at Celeste with a half-smile, pointing to the lipstick marks on his neck and face, and said, "Celeste, care to explain what's going on with these?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the lipstick marks on Brian's face and neck, Celeste was momentarily stunned and then smacked her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forgot to erase the evidence last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of last night's events, her cheeks flushed, and a blush crept up her smooth neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Brian teased with a smile, "Have you secretly admired me for a long time and taken advantage of my drunken state to claim me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Celeste felt embarrassed and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't act all innocent here. I kindly helped you back to your room last night, and you, in your drunken courage, tried to take advantage of me. I haven't even had the chance to confront you about it, and now you're asking me. Had I known, I would've helped you cut that off last night!"</span></p></div>
