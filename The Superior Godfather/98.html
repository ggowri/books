        <h1>Chapter 98 The Employer</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Carter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Derek and Cole were stunned when they saw Sam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected Brian would have called in Sam with just a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam, equally shocked, had no idea that the people Brian wanted him to bring were Derek and Cole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened as he asked, "What the hell are you two doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, deciding to play it up, spoke coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking why they're here? Half an hour ago, they tried to assassinate me, and I caught them. Now tell me. Was this your plan all along? Did you secretly send them after me, trying to seize power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They tried to kill you?" Sam's face went pale, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only sent Derek and Cole to meet Brian, thinking it was just a formal introduction. He never imagined they'd try to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, he quickly bowed deeply to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, I swear I had no idea! I wouldn't dare try to harm you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Carter..." Derek and Cole were utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could say anything, Sam slapped them both hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are out of your minds! I told you to come here and meet the Master of the War Deities, and you think it's a good idea to try to kill him? Are you trying to get yourselves killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek and Cole stared at Brian in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He... He's the Master of the War Deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam shot them an irritated look. "What did you think? Who else would he be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit them like a wave of cold water. They immediately froze in fear, their spines tingling with the horror of what they had just tried to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both lowered their heads in terror. "Master, this was a huge misunderstanding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're blind and stupid. Please forgive us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't even spare them a glance, simply waving his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're your people. Take them and handle it yourself." Then, he turned and walked toward the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Anastasia, who had been watching from the window, felt even more curious about Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two assassins were clearly skilled, and it was clear they had some serious backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their failure wasn't surprising, but the appearance of Sam only added to the mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is he so respectful to Brian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those two assassins... are they his subordinates?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered but couldn't make sense of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rachael, are you okay? Did I scare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's voice brought her back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "With you around, what could possibly happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused before asking, "By the way, did you find out who hired those assassins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian shrugged with a smile. "They're from the Dark Web. They were hired to kill me. Looks like my life's worth a lot. Millions of dollars, apparently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia frowned. "Did you manage to learn who their employer is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian shook his head with a wry smile. "The job was posted as a bounty on the Dark Web. They didn't even know who their real employer was."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes narrowed, a cold edge in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Denzel had asked her about her relationship with Brian, and now he was being targeted by Dark Web assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like this was more than just a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was likely a message, both a test and a warning about her relationship with Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her thoughts grew darker as the weight of it all set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian noticed her change in demeanor and smiled reassuringly, "Don't worry about it. I've got it under control. The food's almost ready. Let's eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia stood up, grabbing her bag. "I've got to take care of something. I'll come back another time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she hurried out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to confront Denzel. If he was behind this, she would make sure he answered for it.</span></p></div>
