        <h1>Chapter 103 Enthusiastic Zoe</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late at night when the carnival ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Eliza were soaked in beer. Their graceful figures were looming, looking extremely attractive. Anastasia said with a look of unsatisfied satisfaction, "It was fun. It was so fun. Those guys were sprayed badly with my beer cannon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, you are so awesome. You sprayed them with beer cannons and made them scream..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time for them to have so much fun and excitement in all these years of being in a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at their sexy and charming appearance, Brian smiled and said, "You two are also very good. At least you didn't hold me back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were talking, a Rolls-Royce Phantom stopped in front of Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car door opened, and Kale walked out. He said respectfully, "Ms. Vaughn, it's getting late. You should go home and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, we are very happy today. It's getting late. We should go home. See you another day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Eliza waved to Brian and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took a taxi back to Riverside Villa No. 9.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just finished his shower and was about to go to bed when the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door, he saw a sexy and charming figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long hair, revealing a charming face. Her mature and sexy figure was wrapped in a purple lace bodysuit, revealing her beautiful breasts and slender legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her looming and charming figure was full of extreme temptation, which made Brian breathe quickly and swallow his saliva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe? Why do you come here dressed like this in the middle of the night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe stretched out her hand and slowly stroked her firm breasts, staring at Brian with seductive eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Mr. Edwards, don't you like me wearing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he like it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was undeniable that any man would like Zoe in this outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her sudden visit late at night caught Brian a little by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Brian was about to speak, Zoe pouted and said with a wronged look, "Mr. Edwards, since you don't like it, I'll just leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked at Brian reluctantly with tears in her eyes and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she was like an abandoned innocent girl, so charming and pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Brian was like a complete scumbag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Brian feel pity and reluctance. He quickly grabbed Zoe's soft hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you that I don't like it? I like it very much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's worry turned into joy in an instant. She stared at Brian with burning eyes. "Mr. Edwards, do you really like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it. Mr. Edwards, you're the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smiled happily, opened her arms, and threw herself into Brian's arms, giving him a loving hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had just finished taking a shower and was only wrapped in a bath towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Zoe's action, he only felt her large and soft breasts deform under the pressure of his chest, giving him a strong stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was actually topless, without any bra inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Brian felt his heart was burning. He reached out and hugged Zoe's enchanting and hot body into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a mature woman's fragrance quietly emanated, making Brian breathe rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, have you missed me these days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Zoe's enthusiasm and her affectionate eyes, Brian nodded. "Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe hooked her hand around Brian's neck, pressed her body against his, and exhaled sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, do you miss my body or my company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the flaming red lips so close, Brian couldn't help swallowing his saliva. "I miss them both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was simply a seductive fairy, and she could always arouse his most primitive desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? I miss you too... Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Zoe finished her words, Brian could no longer suppress the impulse in his heart and kissed her sexy flaming red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe made a seductive moan and responded to his kiss passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, she took the initiative and slid her tongue into Brian's mouth and stirred it constantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she even held Brian's tongue in her mouth and sucked it passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her attack, Brian felt that it was difficult for him to breathe, and there seemed to be a raging fire burning in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no longer passively enjoying it but took the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up Zoe and came to the sofa, pressing her under him. While he sucked Zoe's tongue greedily, he stretched out his hands to rub her perfect breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong stimulation made Brian fascinated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head to kiss Zoe's neck, then went all the way down, buried his head between her huge breasts, and greedily smelled the rich fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he used his fingers to flick the two gradually hardened pink nipples.</span></p></div>
