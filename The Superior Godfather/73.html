        <h1>Chapter 73 Master Agrees to Meet You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Sam felt extremely aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was Master talking about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clearly from copying the rules all night, not from picking up girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was laughing uncontrollably, her entire body shaking, making her smooth bosom even more noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't know it, but Zoe did. She had seen Sam copying the rules in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Zoe's seductive appearance, Brian pretended to be angry. "Zoe, be serious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe quickly cleared her voice and stood up straight, her plump chest almost bursting out of her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam didn't want Brian to misunderstand, so he started to explain, "Master, you got it wrong. I haven't been chasing after women. These dark circles are from copying the rules all night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've copied the rules a thousand times. Please check them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Sam handed two thick stacks of notebooks to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't expect there to be so many. He spoke calmly, "No need to check. As long as you've finished, it's fine. So, what do you want to report to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam replied respectfully, "Firstly, I want to report on the recent situation and developments over the past few years. Secondly, I want to recommend some talented individuals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes lit up with interest. "Oh? Tell me about your experiences over the past few years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you disbanded the War Deities, I relocated to Aurop and founded an assassination group called the Peerless Sect. Now, I control all of Aurop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your intention to reorganize the War Deities, I am willing to merge the Peerless Sect into it and serve as your sharpest weapon. Please grant me this opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, Sam clasped his hands together and knelt on one knee before Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at Sam with admiration, a smile spreading across his face as he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've put great thought into this. We'll merge the Peerless Sect into the War Deities. All its members will be under your command."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's face lit up with excitement and joy. "Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded thoughtfully, then asked, "By the way, you mentioned recommending some talent to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I have a cousin in Riverwood who is quite talented. I'd like to recommend him to join the War Deities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't dwell on it and replied with a smile, "With the War Deities reorganizing, it's the perfect time to recruit new talent. Since you recommend him, I'll meet your cousin. Arrange a place for us tomorrow at noon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Master. I'll arrange it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam nodded quickly and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he left the room, Sam eagerly called Ryan to share the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sam, are you serious? Master wants to see me tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Evans Villa, Ryan was thrilled after receiving Sam's call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Prepare yourself well, and don't embarrass me in front of the Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan promised confidently, "Don't worry, Sam. I won't let you down tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Ryan's excitement overflowed, and he couldn't help but laugh wildly in his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahahaha. I finally made a comeback! Brian, just wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the commotion, Sophia, Robert, and Mary quickly rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, what's going on? Why are you so happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan exclaimed, "Sophia, Sam has recommended me to the Master of the War Deities, and I've been invited to meet him tomorrow at noon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Ryan's confirmation, Sophia couldn't contain her excitement any longer and threw her arms around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the man Sophia had set her heart on. What did it matter if Brian was the chairman of Trillion Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Ryan joined the War Deities and earned the respect of Master, he could easily surpass Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha. Great! We're finally emerging from this dark cloud."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Brian became a partner at Trillion Group, they had faced considerable outside controversy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many criticized them as foolish, short-sighted, and unappreciative, saying they had lost a good man like Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they could finally hold their heads high again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Ryan officially joined the War Deities, those doubters would realize how right their judgment had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad. Mom. What's got you so happy?" Anne, who had just returned, couldn't help but ask curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert said, "Anne, you're back just in time. I have great news. Ryan is about to join the War Deities and secure an important position! Haha. What do you think? Isn't this incredible news?"</span></p></div>
