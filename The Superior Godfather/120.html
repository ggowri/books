        <h1>Chapter 120 Celeste's Stunning Figure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying goodbye to George, Damian felt increasingly conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had driven here late at night, hoping George would clarify his confusion, but he was brushed off with just a few sentences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole thing left him feeling incredibly frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, something clicked, and his eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George said the Trillion Group wasn't his. He was just managing it, and now it's back with its rightful owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he trying to tell me that the Trillion Group belongs to Brian or his family? George just handed it back to Brian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would mean Thomas' investigation was wrong. Brian isn't from an ordinary background... he's probably from an elite family... and all this happened after his divorce from Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this mean Brian's family opposed his marriage to Sophia, so they stripped him of his status and power... and only after the divorce did they accept him back and let him run the Trillion Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if the Trillion Group is just a small piece of Brian's family empire? Could managing it be some test from his family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to Brian's tactics and performance at the shareholders' meeting, Damian felt more confident about his theory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Denzel was one of the heirs to the Vaughn family, with impressive status and power, Damian decided to take a gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, helping someone in tough times was worth more than adding to their success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When everyone else betrayed Brian, stepping up to support him now would surely earn his deeper trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, he pulled out his phone and dialed Celeste's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her luxurious villa, Celeste was sleeping soundly in her soft bed when she was suddenly jolted awake by the sharp ring of her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God, who calls at this hour? What a pain," she muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still half-asleep and unable to open her eyes, she fumbled for her phone and declined the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the phone rang again moments later. After several persistent attempts, she finally sat up in frustration, turned on the bedside lamp, and answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this?" she snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lamplight revealed Celeste's flawless figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been sleeping in the nude, her perfect porcelain skin completely bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full breasts were perfectly shaped, with delicate pink nipples that stood prominently, creating an alluring sight that would make any man's mouth water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawthorne, this is Damian... I have something urgent to report to you and Mr. Edwards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's expression turned sour as she recognized Damian's voice on the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so important that it needs reporting right now? Mr. Edwards must be asleep by now. Can't this wait until tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawthorne, by tomorrow, it will be too late..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian proceeded to explain Thomas' plan to Celeste in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? They're planning a mass resignation and withdrawing their investments?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Celeste's face turned pale as she jumped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her elegant figure commanded attention at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even more astonishing was that her mysterious area was completely bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an image of pure seduction, an irresistible temptation that stirred the deepest desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes... and most of the company's shareholders and executives are involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's confirmation made Celeste draw in a sharp breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined Thomas would resort to such ruthless tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they went through with their mass resignation and investment withdrawal, it would be devastating to the entire Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The company's market value could evaporate overnight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made Celeste's heart race with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading to Mr. Edwards' place to discuss countermeasures! Get there as soon as you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she threw on her nightgown and raced to Brian's villa in her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to devise a solution before dawn, or the entire Trillion Group would be finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On her way to Brian's villa, Celeste pulled out her phone and tried calling him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one picked up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Brian was locked in an intense, passionate encounter with Anne in the villa, their heavy breathing echoing through the rooms.</span></p></div>
