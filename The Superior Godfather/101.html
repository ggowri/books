        <h1>Chapter 101 Copy Regulations Three Thousand Times</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Anastasia and Eliza walked out of the hotel, Eliza couldn't help asking, "Ms. Vaughn, were the two assassins who wanted to kill Brian really sent by Denzel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded indifferently. "I know my cousin too well. If it was just my guess before, now I can be sure it was him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vaughn, it seems that he doesn't want you to be with Brian. What are your plans next? Will you tell Brian about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Eliza's question, Anastasia thought for a moment and replied, "I don't want him to think that I approached him with a purpose, so I don't want him to know my identity for the time being. Don't tell him about this yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This assassination failed. Denzel is a man who will not give up until he achieves his goal. He will definitely think of other ways. Let someone keep an eye on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza nodded respectfully. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia wanted to say something, but her stomach suddenly growled with hunger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza was slightly startled and turned to look at Anastasia. "Ms. Vaughn, are you hungry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's beautiful face showed a bitter smile. "Brian prepared a table full of dishes. But I was in a hurry to come to Denzel to ask for an explanation. So I left before eating..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a pity. Brian's cooking skills are amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza looked regretful. She pointed to a barbecue restaurant not far away and said with shining eyes, "Ms. Vaughn, there is a barbecue restaurant over there. How about we try it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I haven't eaten barbecue for many years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes flashed, and she nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon they arrived at the barbecue restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The food in this restaurant was quite good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza said while eating, "The food in this restaurant tastes really authentic. It's just that it's a bit lonely for the two of us to eat. I feel that something is missing. Ms. Vaughn, why don't you call Brian and ask him to come as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled charmingly, took out her phone, and called Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the lobby of Shadow Fang headquarters, Sam sat on a chair, looking at Cole and Derek with cold eyes. His eyes were filled with endless anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two idiots, you almost killed me today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Carter, this was purely an accident. We just wanted to make some extra money. We didn't know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Sam's rebuke, Derek and Cole shrank their necks. They lowered their heads and kept silent, looking like two scared chickens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Zoe next to him couldn't help but ask curiously, "Sam, are they the two people that Mr. Edwards asked you to pick up? Come on, tell me what happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam angrily recounted the whole story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These two guys are my subordinates from Aurop. I asked them to meet Mr. Edwards and see the world. But they ended up taking an assassination mission, and the target of the assassination happened to be Mr. Edwards..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Sam's story, Zoe couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's two subordinates were even dumber than Raven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole and Derek were embarrassed and wanted to find a hole to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was definitely the biggest failure in their careers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After laughing, Zoe asked, "Then how are you going to punish them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Punish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam snorted coldly and threw a thick notebook in front of Derek and Cole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know Mr. Edwards, which is excusable. I won't punish you this time! Here are the regulations of the War Deities. Copy them three thousand times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three...three thousand times?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the regulations of the War Deities that Sam threw on the ground, Derek and Cole were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't this a punishment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hands would be crippled after they copied it three thousand times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't know that copying regulations by hand was the tradition of the War Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's eyes turned cold, and he asked sternly, "What? Do you have any objections?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek and Cole shook their heads quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam said unhappily, "What are you still doing here? Go copy it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek and Cole nodded and left quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at their backs as they left, Sam couldn't help but warn them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I'm warning you, if you dare to ask someone else to copy it for you, the consequences will be terrible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek and Cole froze and promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Carter, don't worry. We will definitely copy it ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, Zoe asked in a deep voice, "Sam, who do you think issued the assassination bounty for Mr. Edwards on the Dark Web? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's eyes flashed coldly, and he said angrily, "That person posted it anonymously. I don't know who it is. But no matter who dares to harm Mr. Edwards, I will never let him go. I will definitely get to the bottom of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe stretched her body, got up, and walked upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you have to find out as soon as possible. I'm waiting for your news so that I can report to Mr. Edwards."</span></p></div>
