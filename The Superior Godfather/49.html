        <h1>Chapter 49 Eliza's Admiration</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza's expression was cold as dark elemental energy coursed through her body. A terrifying and oppressive aura radiated from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, her right fist, enveloped in dark energy, smashed toward Brian with terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with a series of sonic booms as her fist cut through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad on strength, but your speed is way too slow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled slightly, not even flinching. He took a half-step forward with his right foot and unleashed a punch, his fist howling with elemental energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Eliza's fist could land on Brian, his punch struck her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, blood sprayed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza was sent flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I actually lose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to hit the ground, Brian quickly appeared in front of her and caught her graceful form in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spun around a few times before steadying himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Gray, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza felt herself enveloped in a warm and sturdy embrace, a strange sense of security washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up at Brian's handsome and cold face, she felt a mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected to be defeated so quickly and completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for the three moves Brian had let her have, she would have lost from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had trained in martial arts since childhood and cultivated dark elemental energy. Even her teacher had said she was incredibly talented and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never lost a fight before, yet she was defeated by Brian today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, she hadn't understood why Anastasia favored Brian so much, but now she did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian really had potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could assist Anastasia, she might actually stand a chance in competing with the other heirs for the family leadership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he really defeat Eliza that easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, watching from a distance, was equally shocked by Brian's strength. Her admiration for him shone in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew how formidable Eliza was. She had once single-handedly defeated over a hundred retired special forces soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she couldn't even withstand one of Brian's punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had once again surprised Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia thought, "Dad shouldn't have any more objections."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Gray."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's voice brought Eliza back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She broke free from his embrace and said, "I'm fine. Mr. Edwards, you're indeed very powerful. I lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Eliza couldn't help but cough violently, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she was seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at her apologetically. "Ms. Gray, I'm really sorry. I haven't fought in a long time and lost my sense of control. Let me treat your injuries as an apology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you heal wounds?" Eliza was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia walked over and said, "Brian's elemental energy has a strong healing ability. You have internal injuries. If you don't get treated promptly, you'll have lingering effects that could greatly impact your strength. Let him help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza couldn't bring herself to refuse. "Alright. Thank you, Mr. Edwards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to my place. It'll be more convenient."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian led Eliza to a room in his villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Eliza's black leather jacket, Brian said, "Ms. Gray, unzip your jacket so I can treat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza hesitated for a moment and then unzipped her jacket, revealing a deep cleavage and her alluring breasts covered by a black bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hadn't expected Eliza to have such a great figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was at least a 34C!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly refocused, his gaze settling on the faint bruise on her chest, clearly caused by his punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Ms. Gray."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Brian placed his palm on Eliza's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The softness and elasticity he felt through his palm made his heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza's face changed, her eyes flashing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This jerk is using the excuse of healing to take advantage of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Eliza was about to snap, she felt a cool stream of energy flow from Brian's palm, soothing the pain in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her injuries began to heal, and she couldn't help but let out a soft, enticing moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's heart raced at the sound, but he forced himself to stay calm and focused on healing Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression was serious, and Eliza looked at him admiringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were clear and calm, devoid of any lust or malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza's lips curved into a slight smile as she thought, "I guess I misunderstood him just now."</span></p></div>
