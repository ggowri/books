        <h1>Chapter 19 A Moment of Triumph</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's unexpected comment made Brian blink in surprise, but a wave of gratitude quickly followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft feeling of her touch on his arm only made him more drawn to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sophia noticed the beautiful woman standing beside Brian, her face soured instantly. The jealousy was hard to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's eyes widened in surprise. His gaze locked onto Anastasia with an intensity that was almost burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunning. Her beauty, figure, and presence easily overshadowed Sophia. This woman was in a whole different league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary were equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't understand why someone as beautiful as Anastasia would be hanging around Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's face darkened too, though there was a flicker of something else in her expression. She was clearly upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Buying a house? Hahaha, good one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia burst out laughing as if she'd just heard the best joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian's a nobody, a poor loser. You seriously think he can buy a house here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each villa here costs millions of dollars. Tell me, how could this failure afford one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan chimed in, grinning mockingly. "Hey, beautiful, this guy just got divorced and walked away with nothing. He doesn't have a penny to his name. Don't let him trick you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Don't believe him for a second. This guy's broke. There's no way he's buying anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're way too beautiful to fall for his tricks. Don't let him scam you for money or worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's smile was almost teasing as she looked at Sophia. Her eyes carried an air of sympathy, almost as if she pitied her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only Sophia had treated Brian better. With his abilities and potential, he could've helped her rise to the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, she had tossed him aside for someone like Ryan. It was laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned into Brian's side, her voice light and teasing. "I'd love for him to scam me for money and affection, but he's just not that type, you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could say anything else, Anastasia continued, "As for calling Brian a loser and a broke guy? You've got no idea what you're talking about. It's honestly embarrassing. His abilities are beyond what any of you could even begin to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should be more worried about your own mess than trying to figure mine out. Right, babe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian couldn't help but feel touched by the way Anastasia was defending him. It was a rare feeling, and he appreciated it deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a second before pulling her closer, wrapping his arm around her slim waist with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. They've got their hands full with their own problems, anyway. Their good times are coming to an end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face turned a deep shade of red, her anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always seen Brian as a tool, nothing more than a stepping stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was with someone else, and this woman was sticking up for him. That was more than she could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne looked just as upset, though there was a hint of jealousy in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had been her first, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan clenched his fists, staring hard at Brian. The jealousy was eating him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't stand the fact that Brian had the attention of such a stunning woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert and Mary were seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't get it, do you? We're trying to help you here! You really think this guy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could finish their sentence, Brian swiftly grabbed their hands and twisted their fingers with a quick snap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare point those filthy fingers at my woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-You... bastard!" Robert and Mary screamed in pain, clutching their hands, but they knew they were powerless. They couldn't do anything to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sales intern and the manager walked over, both with big smiles on their faces. The intern handed over the property deed and villa keys with a respectful bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, everything's all set. Congratulations! You're now the proud owner of Riverside Villa No. 9."</span></p></div>
