        <h1>Chapter 133 Anastasia's Choice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the manor, Anastasia was swimming in the pool. A light blue swimsuit revealed her sexy and curvy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While swimming, her plump breasts seemed ready to burst out, creating waves of ripples. She was like an attractive mermaid from the deep sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anastasia was enjoying this rare leisurely time, Eliza, in a black leather suit, hurried over and reported, "Ms. Vaughn, there's an emergency."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia dove underwater and swam to the edge of the pool. She poked her head out of the water with splashes of water around. Her beautiful face and sexy figure were revealed. The scene of a beauty stepping out of the water was alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia walked over to the nearby sun lounger and sat down, asking, "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza hesitated for a moment and then said, "Trillion Group is going to go bankrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Hearing this, Anastasia was shocked. She asked, "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza replied, "Denzel is manipulating this behind the scenes. Fe convinced Thomas, the second largest shareholder of Trillion Group, to lead many shareholders and senior executives to withdraw their investments and switch to another company. Then, he led them to set up a new company. Finally, he made Thomas expose the whole story and Brian's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now everyone knows that Brian, the new president of Trillion Group, is a commoner. Many business partners want to terminate their cooperation with Trillion Group. The company's stock price has plummeted continuously, and more than half of its market value has been lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coupled with Denzel's instigation behind the scenes, Trillion Group is on the verge of bankruptcy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Eliza's report, Anastasia looked extremely gloomy and unpleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought the last warning would make Denzel rein in his actions. Unexpectedly, not only did he not restrain himself, but he even went further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia finally understood Denzel's purpose for coming to Riverwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to wanting to break the engagement between her and Brian, Denzel wanted to enter the real estate industry and build his own business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His move of poaching the shareholders and senior executives of Trillion Group to establish a new company was a major step towards success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Trillion Group went bankrupt, Denzel could take over all of Trillion Group's businesses. At that time, as long as he managed them well, he could firmly establish himself in the real estate industry and replace Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel was really ambitious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia asked, "What measures have Trillion Group taken so far?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza replied, "Other than giving each remaining employee a bonus of 20 thousand dollars, there are no other measures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are rumors that Trillion Group's capital chain has broken. Currently, major banks and business partners have joined forces. They gathered outside Trillion Group's headquarters building and demanded repayment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Anastasia frowned with a cold face. There was a cold glint in her beautiful eyes. "How much capital can I access now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza said, "Not long ago, the company just invested in a new project. Now, you can only access about 10 billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia made up her mind. "Prepare the money and come with me to see Brian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's words made Eliza start in surprise, "Ms. Vaughn, are you planning to help Brian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded. "I caused this matter. I can't just stand by."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza was panicked. "But the money is reserved for emergency use. Once those people find out that you've used the money and launch a commercial battle against you, the consequences will be unimaginable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care about that much now. If they plan to do that, I'll fight against them to the death. No one will get away easily." Anastasia had an indifferent expression. She changed her clothes and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Eliza gave a bitter smile and quickly followed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the conference room of Queen's Construction Group, Aria was holding a meeting with the company's senior executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she wore black-rimmed glasses, with her wavy curly hair cascading down. She had a white V-neck shirt, a white suit coat, and a white pencil skirt, paired with flesh-colored stockings and high heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this outfit, her hot figure was perfectly revealed. It made her look stylish and sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria held a pointer and pointed at the PPT on the projection screen, explaining the next development plan for Trillion Group's project in Weston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a middle-aged man with a bald crown suddenly stood up and said, "Aria, in my opinion, we don't need to continue with this project."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was Tanner Jenkins. He was Aria's cousin and the vice president of Queen's Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the relationship between the two was not good. Tanner was no longer satisfied with the power in his hands, and he had long wanted to replace Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Aria raised an eyebrow and asked, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner sneered and said in a gloating voice, "Trillion Group is about to go bankrupt."</span></p></div>
