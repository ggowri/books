        <h1>Chapter 40 The Final Winner</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Mark froze at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia, Ryan, and Ethan furrowed their brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them expected Aria to make such a bold move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of surprise crossed both Anastasia's and Brian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, especially, was shocked that Aria had such faith in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paul's and Mark's silence, Aria crossed her stockinged legs and smiled playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you guys so confident about the Carter Group? Why back down from a bet now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul and Mark exchanged glances before bursting into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Ms. Jenkins is eager to gift us money, how can we refuse? A hundred million dollars in cash? We're in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Sophia pondered momentarily before saying, "Ms. Jenkins, if you don't mind, I'd like to join this bet too. I'll wager 100 million dollars that the Trillion Group will ultimately choose the Carter Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she would support Ryan unconditionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the man she had her eyes on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aria was about to speak, Anastasia cut in with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since everyone's so excited about this, I'll join in too! I bet 100 million dollars that Trillion Group will choose Transcendent Construction Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Anastasia shot Sophia a challenging look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia's face darkened. She couldn't understand where Anastasia got the nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait," Sophia said grimly. "You two are going to lose big time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian held up his phone with a smirk. "We'll know who wins soon enough! And don't even think about backing out. I've recorded everything you said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on stage, Celeste was urging Kevin to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wright, stop spacing out! Let's reveal the answer everyone's waiting for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll count to three, and then we'll see who the group's new partner is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin finally snapped back to reality at Celeste's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned frighteningly dark as he looked between the list in his hand and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sure Celeste had secretly switched the lists!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to speak, Celeste snatched the list from his hands and announced with a smile, "Mr. Wright isn't feeling well, so I'll announce on his behalf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights in the hall suddenly went dark, and a spotlight fell on Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The partner that Trillion Group has chosen is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me! Haha... it's my Carter Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan jumped up excitedly when he saw the spotlight on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, it is you!" Sophia exclaimed with excitement, shooting Brian a contemptuous look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Brian, do you see that? This is exactly why I left you for Ryan! You're nothing but a complete failure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, the spotlight suddenly moved away from Ryan and landed on Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's clear, melodious voice rang out through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The chosen partner is Mr. Brian Edwards' Transcendent Construction Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, please give a round of applause and welcome Mr. Edwards to the stage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement was met with dead silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared in disbelief at Brian, who stood tall and handsome under the spotlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Trillion Group to choose this unknown figure as their partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian from Transcendent Construction Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's name began to spread through the crowd like wildfire at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The executives of Trillion Group furrowed their brows, confusion written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadn't they chosen Ryan and the Carter Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... this can't be happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's jubilant laughter died instantly, leaving him frozen like a statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophia stood there stunned, her eyes wide with disbelief as she stared at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this loser become a partner at Trillion Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the usually composed Ethan was thrown entirely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around this outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadn't Kevin promised it was a sure thing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had personally submitted the list himself, so how could this happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is... is it really him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did... did we just lose the bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark and Paul stood there shocked, looking at Brian like they'd seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, looks like I won this little wager," Aria said with a charming smile as she pulled out her phone and a card reader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Sophia, Mark, and Paul with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, would you prefer to pay by cash or card?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anastasia chimed in with a mocking tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Evans, your judgment seems pretty poor! It's hilarious that you treat a cockroach like a treasure while passing up a real dragon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia affectionately clung to Brian's arm and said sweetly, "Honey, don't just stand there. Everyone's waiting for your speech!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded gently and addressed the dazed Ryan and Sophia, "I know you both feel frustrated and lost, but... would you mind stepping aside?"</span></p></div>
