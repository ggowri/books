        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's at least a 36E, I think," Brian thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Aria to have such an impressive figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stunning view made his heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly shifted his gaze to avoid any possible misunderstanding from Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Aria brought the coffee over to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, here you go," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, Ms. Jenkins!" Brian replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria sat down on the sofa opposite him, crossing her beautiful legs encased in black stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Brian with great interest. She was fascinated by this man who had managed to snatch the Trillion Group's project from Ryan and Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her intuition told her that Brian was no ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, what brings you here?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, I'm here to talk business with you. Ms. Jenkins, are you interested in the development of the Weston?" Brian replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think anyone would be uninterested in that project," Aria said with a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched casually, showing her perfect figure, which left Brian feeling a bit parched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was truly a rare beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every move she made exuded a uniquely feminine charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regaining his composure, Brian asked again, "Ms. Jenkins, would you be interested in partnering with me to develop this project?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Partner with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was taken aback, her eyes wide with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was actually planning to share such a lucrative opportunity with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded with a smile. "That's right. I'm a bit lazy and don't want to get involved in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've investigated your company&mdash;you have strong capabilities, and I admire your character. I'd like to befriend you, which is why I'm willing to share this highly profitable project with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, are you serious?" Aria asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded again with a smile. "Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, you're not kidding, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins, if you don't believe me, we can draft the contract right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how serious Brian was, Aria became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her company, though strong, had been facing business shortages due to her refusal to compromise with certain capitalists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could partner with Brian on the Weston project, it would not only solve her current predicament but also elevate her company to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was incredibly significant for Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she knew there was no such thing as a free lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, is there nothing else you want in return?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Else?" Brian frowned in confusion. "What else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's face flushed slightly, her heart filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said in a low voice, "Like asking me to sleep with you or be your mistress..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past business dealings with powerful figures, Aria had encountered such demands, and even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her refusal to comply had led to her company's less-than-ideal performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feared Brian might be the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian burst into laughter, spilling some coffee from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jenkins, what kind of person do you take me for? Do you really think I'm that despicable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was taken aback, a mix of surprise and delight welling up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly explained, "Mr. Edwards, don't get me wrong. I didn't mean it like that. I've just had too many experiences like this... But Mr. Edwards, do you really have no any other demands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Aria's lingering doubt, Brian let out a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is it so hard these days to be an upright person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a straight face, he said, "My only demand is that you help me make the Weston project a success."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked at him earnestly. "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded solemnly. "Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this affirmation, Aria could no longer contain her excitement and joy. She threw herself into Brian's arms, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Edwards, thank you so much! Mr. Edwards, I love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was knocked backward onto the sofa by Aria's sudden embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria lost her balance as well and landed heavily on top of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies were pressed tightly together at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aria..." Brian began, but Aria's lips met his, causing his eyes to widen in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria was also stunned. The warmth and softness of the kiss left her mind completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only intended to give Brian a hug to express her gratitude. She hadn't expected this awkward turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared into each other's eyes, time seemingly frozen at that moment.</span></p></div>
