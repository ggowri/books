        <h1>Chapter 102 Carnival</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Riverside Villa No. 9, Brian was working out in the gym upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cell phone rang at this moment. It was Anastasia calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning that he was invited to have dinner, Brian readily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, he arrived at the restaurant. He saw Anastasia and Eliza, whose faces were red from the spiciness but still greedy, and looked particularly attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow. Brian, come on. The food here tastes really good. It's just that we ordered a very spicy dish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza stuck out her tongue and waved to Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are obviously not locals. Eating barbecue alone without some beer to quench your thirst will definitely be very spicy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian smiled and said to the owner of the restaurant, "Sir, please bring two dozen cold beers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner was very enthusiastic and quickly brought two dozen cold beers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to use a bottle opener to help open the beer, but Brian shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to be so troublesome. Watch this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Brian casually slapped the bottom of the beer bottle with his palm. With a "pop" sound, the beer cap flew out automatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god! You are so amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene directly shocked the owner and waiters of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time they had seen beer opened like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like an amazing magic trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be so cool if they could open beer for guests like Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Eliza's eyes also widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they all picked up the beer excitedly and tried to imitate Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they couldn't open the bottle even after their palms were red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's try it too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner and waiters of the restaurant tried it, but they also failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, they all looked at Brian with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, how did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, what skills do you need to open a bottle of beer like you do? This is so cool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No skills are needed. Just tap it like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, Brian picked up another bottle of beer and tapped it gently at the bottom. The beer cap flew out automatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His action was chic, smooth, and extremely cool. People around them were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some customers in the restaurant also curiously took the beer bottles to try. But without exception, they all failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza tried again, unwilling to give up, but still failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she leaned on the table and held her chin with her hand. She looked at Brian with admiration and pleading eyes. Then she said charmingly, "Mr. Edwards, you are the best in my heart. Can you teach me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza's voice was already very pleasant. And with a hint of admiration and coquettishness, her voice was really too seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially her beautiful breasts were about to burst out because of her posture, revealing her attractive skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was so excited that he couldn't refuse her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed dryly and picked up a bottle of beer to demonstrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem... Actually, this should be very simple for you. You just need some skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First of all, you need to have strong enough palm strength and master a precise force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use the palm strength to shake the bottle cap open at the moment of hitting the bottom of the bottle. Remember, you must not use too much strength. Otherwise, the beer inside will spray out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Brian finished speaking, Eliza picked up the beer bottle and slapped the bottom with her palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The majestic palm strength was released, and the bottle cap was shaken open in an instant. The beer inside was sprayed out like a fountain under the huge effect of her strength, directly spraying Eliza's face and body, soaking her like a drowned rat. She looked very funny and hilarious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you to control your strength, but you still... Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Anastasia and Brian couldn't help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner, staff, and customers in the restaurant also laughed heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza was embarrassed and wanted to find a hole to crawl into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Brian and Anastasia laughing, she was embarrassed and angry. "What are you laughing at? Watch this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, she picked up a bottle of beer and shook it violently, then slapped the bottom of the bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the beer sprayed towards Brian and Anastasia, splashing their faces and making them look embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their funny appearance, Eliza also laughed heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliza, how dare you spray me? Just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian picked up a bottle of beer and sprayed it directly at Eliza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia also picked up a bottle of beer, opened it with a bottle opener, and shook it violently. Together with Brian, she sprayed Eliza, setting off a big fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner, staff, and customers around the restaurant laughed even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Eliza, Anastasia, and Brian picked up the beer bottles and sprayed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliza said, "You guys just laughed at us. Try my beer cannon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian laughed at this moment and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, let's have fun! I'll pay for all of this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, let's have fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Brian's words, people suddenly became extremely excited and started a beer festival carnival.</span></p></div>
