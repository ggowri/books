        <h1>Chapter 9 Onslaught of Shadow Fang</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had no clue this was all a test orchestrated by Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping his composure, he said, "No need to worry, Ms. Vaughn. It's just a gang. I'm not even sweating it. Let's keep going..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitress couldn't help but roll her eyes at his bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously? He's still trying to flirt? What a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, people murmured, shaking their heads in disbelief. They thought Brian was just full of hot air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Riverwood, how many would dare to challenge Raven and Shadow Fang, the most notorious gang around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled, a hint of admiration in her eyes, "I don't know where you're getting all this confidence, Mr. Edwards, but I admire your guts. Here's to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her glass and clinked it against Brian's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Tyrone stormed in, flanked by a massive enforcer and a gang of thugs wielding steel pipes and knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raven, this is the punk who took me down!" Tyrone shouted, his face twisted in rage as he pointed an accusatory finger at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mood in the room shifted instantly; shocked gasps filled the air. Whispers spread like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"R... Raven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way, Tyrone actually called him in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raven's a ruthless enforcer for Shadow Fang... That guy is in deep trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's brows furrowed, a flicker of concern crossing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The odds were stacked against Brian, and she worried he wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Brian remained unfazed, his expression steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anastasia contemplated calling for help, Tyrone charged at Brian, jabbing a finger in his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thought you were tough, huh? Now that Raven's here, let's see you keep that attitude, smartass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Raven backing him, Tyrone regained his swagger, raising his hand to slap Brian across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Brian's eyes narrowed, and he seized Tyrone's wrist, twisting it with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh..." Tyrone cried out as his fingers snapped, collapsing before Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to retaliate, but Brian delivered a swift kick that sent him sprawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he clutched his broken hand, Tyrone's rage simmered like a pot about to boil over, yet beneath the surface, a flicker of fear danced in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn, this guy's a real piece of work. Can you believe he had the balls to go up against me with Raven in my camp?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrone moped over to Raven, wearing a sorry-ass look. "Yo, Raven! Did you see how full of himself that dude was? You have to support me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chill out, I won't let this slide," Raven said, taking a long drag from his cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were as cold as steel as he stared down Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a little while ago, Ryan had given him a ring, offering a sweet two-million-dollar payday to off someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that someone was Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven had been all over the north side of town, hunting for Brian. He never thought he'd stumble upon Brian here, having the time of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven jeered, "Dude, you've been a real pain in the ass to find. And look at you, playing the Casanova while your life's hanging by a thread!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face hardened in an instant when he caught the crucial bit in Raven's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell do you want with me?" he snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a two-million-dollar bounty on your head. I'm here to turn you into mincemeat. Your number's up," Raven said, grinning like a psycho.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, take him down! Make sure he doesn't breathe another day!" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, a bunch of Shadow Fang goons, armed with pipes and knives, charged at Brian like a pack of rabid dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place went crazy in a flash. People were running for their lives, trying to get away from the coming bloodbath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stayed as cool as a cucumber. He lit a cigarette, popped it between his lips, and strolled straight into the oncoming horde of Shadow Fang goons like he didn't have a care in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A guy came at him with a machete. Brian casually sidestepped and brought his hand down like a hammer on the guy's neck. The dude dropped to the ground, knocked out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another punk with a steel pipe went wild swinging at Brian. He shot out his foot, kicking the guy so hard he flew into the crowd, causing screams and chaos as people were trampled and injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian just kept on going, moving through the mob as casually as if he was taking a Sunday walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Fang guys didn't even know what hit them before they were lying on the ground, knocked out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time at all, he'd cleared the whole lot of them and was right in front of Raven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bellow of rage, Raven drew back his fist and swung at Brian with every ounce of strength he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That punch was like a freight train, strong enough to turn a sheet of metal into scrap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brian? He just caught it with his palm, like he was swatting away a fly.</span></p></div>
