        <h1>Chapter 131 Conspiracy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they... are they actually delivering money to Trillion Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Wasn't their account empty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas, Eric, Zac, and the others exchanged bewildered looks as they watched the money being transported into Trillion Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As former senior executives, they knew Trillion Group's financial situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were absolutely certain the accounts had been depleted&mdash;yet here they were, witnessing something that should have been impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their confusion deepened when they spotted Callian and his group leaving Trillion Group, looking decidedly frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas turned to Jensen. "Jensen, you were in charge of the security department before, weren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Lee," Jensen replied respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Callian was your subordinate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Jensen replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Get him over here. We need to know what's happening," Thomas ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jensen quickly pulled out his phone and made the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes later, Callian hurried over, bowing deferentially to Thomas and the others. "Mr. Lee, Mr. Reeves, good afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas fixed him with a penetrating stare. "Callian, Jensen tells me you led a group to Brian's office to demand wages. How did things get resolved so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callian knew full well he'd been manipulated by Jensen, used as a pawn in their scheme. Without his influence, Callian would never have instigated the wage protest or resigned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that he'd burned his bridges with Trillion Group, his only option was to align himself with Thomas and his faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Callian explained the situation, Thomas' eyes widened in disbelief. "Let me get this straight&mdash;not only did they pay all wages immediately, but they added an extra month's salary? And every employee who stays gets a 20-thousand-dollar bonus&mdash;half in cash now, half with next month's paycheck?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group was shocked as they listened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armored trucks' presence suddenly made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had masterfully turned their rumors of financial trouble against them, proving the company's solvency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Denzel had to admire the bonus structure&mdash;it was cleverly designed to ensure employee loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian is more cunning than we anticipated," Denzel thought. "He devised such an effective strategy to stabilize morale so quickly. No wonder Anastasia refuses to break the engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you said their accounts were empty&mdash;where did they get this kind of money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas considered for a moment before responding. "Mr. Vaughn, I suspect they secured a loan. Since news of our departure hasn't gone public yet, banks would still consider them creditworthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this is just a temporary solution. Once word gets out about our mass exodus, Trillion Group's reputation will be in tatters. Their stock will plummet, and their business partners will rush to terminate contracts and demand settlements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A predatory smile crossed his face as he continued, "Banks won't just stop lending&mdash;they'll call in existing loans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Trillion Group defaults, we can quietly encourage the banks to liquidate them. We'll be perfectly positioned to acquire their entire operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the right publicity campaign, Quadrillion Group will become the talk of the industry. Our stock will soar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group's excitement was palpable as they contemplated their impending triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel's expression softened as he clapped Thomas on the shoulder. "I knew I could count on you. The chairman position is yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Vaughn. I won't let you down," Thomas replied, barely containing his elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel turned his attention to Callian. "Bring over the hundred people who resigned with you. You'll all join Quadrillion Group with doubled salaries and equivalent benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I need you to do something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callian's face lit up. "Anything you need, Mr. Vaughn. I'm at your service."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint appeared in Denzel's eyes. "Nothing too complicated. I want you to spread rumors within Trillion Group&mdash;undermine their morale, poach their best talent. You know how it's done, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need to teach you how to do it, do I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Callian replied eagerly. "I'll tell them Trillion Group is truly on the brink of collapse, that these bonuses are just a desperate ploy. I'll convince them to take the money and run."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and the others exchanged approving looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Denzel regarded Callian with newfound respect. "You've got potential, young man. Keep this up, and you'll find yourself on the management team before long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ecstatic, Callian quickly replied, "Thank you, Mr. Vaughn, everyone. I won't waste this opportunity. I'll prove myself worthy of your trust."</span></p></div>
