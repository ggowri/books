        <h1>Chapter 113 My Dad's Coming!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick had trained in martial arts since childhood, specializing in kickboxing and fighting techniques. His combat skills were impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd made a name for himself in underground fight clubs, earning the title "Boxing King of Riverwood" with an incredible streak of eighty-six wins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lightning-fast punch shot straight for Brian's face, but Brian blocked it with just one finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's eyes widened as he stared in shock at the single index finger that had stopped his punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing on his extensive fighting experience, he quickly shook off his surprise and prepared to change tactics, but Brian flicked his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Argh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy sent Patrick flying backward like a cannonball. He crashed to the ground, clutching his shattered fist and screaming in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor rushed to his side, her face filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick didn't respond. He just clutched his right hand in pain while glaring at Brian with pure venom in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined this guy would be so mighty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gave them a cold glance before turning to leave with Celeste, not wanting any further entanglement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's face turned ashen with rage, feeling deeply insulted. He roared at his bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you standing around for? Stop these two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad will be here any minute. Then I'll make this bastard pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards hesitated, then forced themselves to block Brian's path despite their injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian stopped in his tracks and turned to Patrick. "Looking for another beating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Screw you, you piece of shit! Just wait till my dad gets here. Then you'll see how I'm gonna end you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick glared at Brian with venomous eyes, his teeth clenched in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking smile played across Brian's lips, his eyes filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered something about Patrick's father, Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the business conference, Paul had initially kissed Ryan and Sophia. Still, when Brian became a partner at Trillion Group, he'd done a complete one-eighty and started groveling for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had zero respect for such a two-faced opportunist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, he said, "You think daddy's gonna come save you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to bet he'll be on his knees begging for forgiveness when he sees me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick couldn't help but laugh at Brian's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're full of shit. Who the hell do you think you are?" he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleanor chimed in with a mocking smile, "Brian, you worthless piece of trash, you're so full of yourself. Do you even know who Patrick's father is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you! He is Paul Smith, and he's got connections everywhere. He's a big shot in Riverwood who can make a nobody like you disappear without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better get on your knees and apologize right now, or you'll be sorry when he arrives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian and Celeste exchanged amused glances before responding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh really? We'd love to see what he can do to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a commotion erupted from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's astonishment, Paul appeared with his wife, Olivia Smith, accompanied by hundreds of intimidating men in black suits marching toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their overwhelming presence and powerful aura had everyone backing away, creating a path through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! Mom!" Patrick called out excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. and Mrs. Smith," Eleanor greeted them as she and Patrick rushed to meet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Patrick's miserable condition, Paul's face darkened, while Olivia asked with anger and heartbreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick, Eleanor... which bastard did this to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it was those two pieces of trash... you have to get justice for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick complained to Olivia about Brian and Celeste with a tearful face, spewing insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his story, Paul's face turned dark as thunder. In contrast, Olivia's face flushed red with rage as she pointed at Brian and Celeste and shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless pieces of garbage, you dare to mess with my son?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all standing around for? Take these two out and dump them in the river for the fish!"</span></p></div>
