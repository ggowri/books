  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did it really work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of the Eighth World Tree offshoot's lair, Osborne crouched in the shadows, gripping the Bloodwrought Bow tightly. Before him, he watched in awe as the massive roots of the Eighth World Tree offshoot began to crumble rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood-red light surged from the void, spreading from the roots up into the trunk. The enormous tree trembled violently, unleashing a terrifying wave of divine power as it struggled to dispel the crimson glow, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Painful roars echoed through the air, shaking the very ground beneath Osborne's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He witnessed the Eighth World Tree offshoot disintegrating before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, its countless roots shattered and vanished while the trunk, branches, and leaves withered away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the once-mighty life force of the Eighth World Tree offshoot fading fast, teetering on the brink of extinction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in shock as he absorbed the terrifying energy radiating from the Bloodstrike Orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is the power of the Bloodstrike Orb? Thank goodness I have time power! If that orb had detonated in my hands, I'd be a goner! Primordial wasn't lying. The immortality of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity isn't invincible! Those high-level energies could genuinely kill me, leaving no chance for resurrection!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew grave as he fixated on the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Primordial's urgent voice broke through his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, help me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The explosion energy from the Bloodstrike Orb is spreading! My roots were caught off guard and got touched by its energy! They're collapsing, and soon, the Bloodstrike Orb's energy will threaten my true form! It could even endanger your Soul Current Ocean and your body...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words sent a jolt of fear through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! Your roots were contaminated by the Bloodstrike Orb's energy? What </span><span>should</span><span> we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen how the Eighth World Tree offshoot's roots had been tainted, causing the energy to spread uncontrollably to its true form, leading to its rapid collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Primordial's roots were facing the same dire threat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, forcing himself to think clearly about how he could assist Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An idea sparked in his mind. He quickly relayed to Primordial. "Bring your roots back! I'll try to freeze the Bloodstrike Orb's energy with my time power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Primordial replied swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a slender root emerged from the void, its tip radiating the horrifying energy of the Bloodstrike Orb, spreading rapidly toward Primordial's true form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everywhere the Bloodstrike Orb's energy touched, Primordial's roots crumbled and vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This energy is terrifying! Just a tiny bit has such power! Is everything from the Umbra World this dangerous? Just a touch and it's over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dared not dwell on the thought and sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Stasis!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum, the blood-red energy on Primordial's root halted its advance, as if time itself had frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Crimson Energy appeared to solidify in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial also relaxed, grateful for the momentary reprieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, if you cut off that root, should everything be fine?" Osborne asked, his voice laced with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's expression was grave. "It's not that simple! This Crimson Energy is incredibly insidious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can lock onto my life force. Even if I sever that root, it will still track me down through my energy and explode on me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only way to stop it is to completely crush it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at this, "Crush it completely? Do you have any ideas on how to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial admitted, "I can't think of anything at the moment. But you should check on the Eighth World Tree offshoot... If it can handle the Crimson Energy, we might be able to learn something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding, Osborne turned his gaze back to the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw was heartbreaking. The Bloodstrike Orb had exploded near its roots, saturating them with Crimson Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the energy spread even more rapidly through its form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trunk was on the verge of total collapse. What had once been a massive canopy stretching hundreds of miles was now shattered, leaving only a small section of the trunk, which was crumbling inward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, to Osborne's astonishment, he noticed the surrounding Crimson Energy slowly dissipating, as if being absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absorbed? Can the aftermath of the Bloodstrike Orb explosion actually be absorbed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, why don't you try absorbing some of that Crimson Energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial fell silent, clearly hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he finally spoke, "How about you give it a shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have the gift of immortality. This Crimson Energy isn't that strong; even if you can't handle it, you should come back to life! I'm not in the same boat. I've just been born, and my power isn't enough. If I can't withstand it, my body will be tainted, and that will put your Soul Current Ocean at risk..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean you can't handle it? What if I can't handle it either? What if my immortality doesn't work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we'll both be dead!" Primordial shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew they had to deal with this Crimson Energy quickly. Temporal Stasis wasn't invincible. It couldn't hold forever. Given the intensity of that Crimson Energy, it would likely break through in less than an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happened, both he and Primordial would be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absorb it?" Osborne pondered, weighing the chances of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thought struck him. "Wait! My Infinite Devouring Eyes are said to be able to absorb and refine any energy in existence! Using them to absorb this Crimson Energy should work, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to take the risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But first, he wanted to assess the Eighth World Tree offshoot's situation. If it proved that absorption was viable, he would give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not, he'd have to come up with a different plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Eighth World Tree offshoot's massive trunk had dwindled to just a small section, rapidly shrinking. However, under its desperate attempts to absorb the energy, the surrounding Crimson Energy was thinning out quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, all the Crimson Energy was completely absorbed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the life force of the Eighth World Tree offshoot began to surge back to life.</span></p><div class="pagination">
