  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne consumed the final core energy of the fourth and last Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, a sharp pain shot through his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though his Satan's Eye was on the verge of bursting forth from its confines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, blood tears streamed down his face like a relentless river, but instead of panic, a wave of exhilaration washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that this was a sign&mdash;his Satan's Eye was about to break through to Level Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Ten was rumored to be the ultimate form of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From its humble beginnings, where it merely enhanced his vision far beyond that of an ordinary person, to its current state, the evolution had been nothing short of remarkable. At Level One, Satan's Eye granted him enhanced sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level Two, it allowed him to see through solid objects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Three empowered him to manipulate matter itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By Level Four, he could devour others' elemental essences and incorporate them into his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Five opened the door to psychic power, enabling him to project illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Six took it a step further, allowing him to manipulate memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level Seven, it unlocked time power, freezing time in a specific area, while Level Eight amplified those time abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Nine gifted him the Infinite Devouring Eyes, a power that was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what would Level Ten bring? Osborne couldn't quite fathom the possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would it enhance his Infinite Devouring Eyes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anticipation was almost unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I owe everything I have to the Satan's Eye. Without it, I'd still be a nobody on Blue Planet, lost in the crowd, invisible to the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Satan's Eye, I've gained elemental powers, treasures, and the strength I have now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, it's finally reaching Level Ten! Is this truly the final form?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What will it look like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced with excitement as the transformation began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum filled the air as blood tears continued to flow, but then something extraordinary happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color of the tears shifted from a bright crimson to a soft gold and finally to a pure golden hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This golden blood poured from his Satan's Eye, radiating an overwhelming aura of power. In that instant, a tenth star appeared in his pupil&mdash;a brilliant golden star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden burst, Satan's Eye erupted in a dazzling golden light. When the brilliance faded, Osborne felt a profound change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eye appeared ordinary at first glance, indistinguishable from any other, save for a slight brightness and depth that hinted at its true nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne knew instantly that something was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vision had reached an extraordinary level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was crystal clear. Even Zoe and the others, who had concealed her energy with the Eclipsing Mantra, were laid bare before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see their level, their Divine Body, and the level of her elemental power&mdash;all the information flooded into his mind as if she had no secrets left to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just the beginning of his new abilities. Osborne felt empowered, able to perceive the flow of energy around him, to sense the currents of space, and even to glimpse the cyclical nature of time itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wh-what the..." Osborne stammered, his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world around him felt fundamentally transformed; it was as though every mystery had been laid bare before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his gaze toward Divine Peak Nine, a place that had once appeared shrouded in enigma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everything was strikingly clear. Osborne could see the intricate network of city-level, town-level Deathborn nests and Deathborn Kingdom sprawled across the peak. He even spotted the densely packed Celestial Sword Peaks, each one teeming with Deathborn flocking toward an enormous humanoid statue in an act of worship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miracle Elixir!" he murmured, recognizing the precious plants growing around the towering statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment of revelation, something deep within him stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His focus sharpened even further, and he glanced deeper into Divine Peak Nine. At its heart stood a colossal Celestial Sword Peak, topped with an immense statue that appeared to tower over everything else, reaching heights of a staggering 70 miles. The statue was entwined tightly with a web of tree roots, binding it to the peak, as if nature itself was trying to reclaim this behemoth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily frozen by the sheer magnitude and strangeness of the sight before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stand still as his eyes locked with the statue's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a surge of energy shot from its gaze, piercing through the air like an arrow aimed directly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Osborne cried out, doubling over as intense pain erupted in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched his eyes, collapsing to his knees as blood streamed down his face like a torrential downpour.</span></p><div class="pagination">
