  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, where are you? Lachlan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's voice echoed through the abandoned mine as she frantically searched for him, her anxiety palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah is looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he decided to reveal himself from a nearby cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she heard Osborne's voice, Hannah's face lit up with relief. She rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, I'm so glad you're okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew puzzled. "You were looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's tone turned sharp. "What do you think?! It's been almost five days, and every time I went to Spark Estate, they said you hadn't shown up. Turns out you never went back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was worried something happened to you, thinking maybe another </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> appeared after I left. I had to come to check on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If something had happened, I'd never forgive myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why have you been here for so long without returning to Wild Flame City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scratched his nose, offering a sheepish smile. "It was nothing serious. I just felt some insights in my training and needed to meditate for a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry for making you worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded, seemingly satisfied with his explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, did you get stronger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a grin. "I guess you could say that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Want to spar with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, shaking his head. "No thanks, I'm not your match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his breakthrough into the Transcendent Deity realm, Hannah might have posed a significant challenge, even defeating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with his newfound power, besting her would be a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne preferred to keep his cards close to his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah smirked, clearly pleased with herself. "Heh, good call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're wise to admit defeat. At your level, giving me this much pressure is quite impressive. When you reach Celestial Deity's peak, I might not stand a chance against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But by then, I'll have hit Deity Overlord status!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't lose to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes burned with fierce competitiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed. "Alright, you're the best. Let's head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly seemed to remember something and asked, "By the way, when did you get here? How did you come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah looked puzzled. "Two hours ago, using the Malevolence Airship. Why do you ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did anyone see you coming? Or know you were here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah thought for a moment before shaking her head. "I don't think so. I'm always </span><span>careful, so no one has ever seen my true face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Hannah asked, even more puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Nothing, let's head back. I don't want to take the Malevolence Airship. We'll fly back together. You'll need to use your power to shield me, just in case we attract any </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face flushed crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "This guy, refusing to marry into the Gellar family, now wants to fly back with me? And he wants me to use my power to protect him? My power's range is so small, does he want us to get closer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a delightful rush of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that Hannah had misunderstood him, but he chose not to clarify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason Osborne had asked her those questions and suggested they sneak back to Wild Flame City was that he was worried about the implications of having killed Tobey, Myron, and Sara. He feared that Hannah could get caught up in the fallout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware that the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Royston family would soon come looking for the three missing individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their resources, it wouldn't take long for them to figure out that the trio had been murdered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the time since their deaths, anyone who had been in the area would likely come under suspicion. If anyone had seen Hannah here, she would also be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid drawing attention to themselves, Osborne proposed that they skip using the Malevolence Airship and instead use her power to conceal their presence as they quietly made their way back to Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, sounds good," Hannah replied, not fully grasping Osborne's true intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought he just wanted to get closer to her, and her cheeks flushed as she summoned her power to envelop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, they were standing just a few feet apart, the air between them charged with an unexpected tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they flew toward Wild Flame City, Osborne began to sense the atmosphere shifting into something more intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's neck and ears were flushed, and she kept stealing glances at him from the corners of her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding the situation amusing, Osborne quickly decided to change the subject. "So, Hannah, has anything big happened in Wild Flame City lately?" he asked, trying to keep the mood light.</span></p><div class="pagination">
