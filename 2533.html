  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of thousands of Empyrean Sacredness warriors might sound like a vast number, but before Dalia's hundreds of terrifying tentacles, they stood no chance. They were slaughtered in waves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They screamed and begged desperately, but it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could only attack the Phantomagic Realm with all their might. The Phantomagic Realm became even more shattered, but they could never completely destroy it. Their eyes gradually filled with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne stood inside Drum's Dimensional Microcosm. Watching Dalia's frenzied slaughter outside, his expression was grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, is it really safe here?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum stood on Osborne's left shoulder, nodded firmly, and said confidently, "Dad, don't worry, this monster can't find us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne completely relaxed after hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that without Drum, he would surely be like those outside, helplessly waiting for death, watching those tentacles pierce his body and drain every drop of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm still too weak! My cultivation level is too low! If I were an advanced Empyrean Sacredness now... even if I still couldn't defeat Dalia at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, I could definitely put up a fight!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, at least I could break this damn Phantomagic Realm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne bit his lip tightly. At this moment, he longed to become stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Osborne had already reached the limit of Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. As long as he wished, he could break through his cultivation level at any time and become an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he still remembered Adriana's reminder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel would be led by the Glorious Divine Kingdom to a mysterious place called Necropolis City. And only those below Empyrean Sacredness could enter its core area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before going to Necropolis City, I must suppress the breakthrough of my cultivation level! I must destroy his past life's father, the Glorious Divine Emperor's plan in Necropolis City. I can't let the Glorious Divine Emperor gain power in Necropolis City and break through to become a true Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, I can forget about avenging myself in this lifetime!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne suppressed the idea of immediately breaking through to become an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that even if he broke through to Empyrean Sacredness, he would only reach primary Empyrean Sacredness. Even if his strength improved, he definitely wouldn't be a match for Dalia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching the massacre outside, Osborne felt a wave of helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he couldn't change anything, so he simply stopped watching. He began checking the condition of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, while seizing the last nine Bewitching Lanterns, the Warfare Ancient Tree was struck by Dalia's tentacles and suffered significant injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, its aura only weakened without any fundamental damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there were a total of ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns hanging on the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Bewitching Lanterns seemed to be undergoing some kind of change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, you're in luck!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "These ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns have absorbed almost all the power of the Phantomagic Realm. The Phantomagic Realm will never appear again! And these ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns have thus gained the power to evolve into an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, they will merge and transform on the Warfare Ancient Tree! It won't take long before they fully merge and evolve into a true Imperial Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit excited after hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally heard some good news. Those ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns, each one was a Legendary Sacred Artifact. But that was before absorbing the power of the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After absorbing the power of the Phantomagic Realm, they can all evolve into Supreme Sacred Artifacts. If they eventually merge together, they will become a true Imperial Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was immensely looking forward to the day when the Bewitching Lantern would transform into an Imperial Artifact. By then, with the Imperial Artifact, his power would skyrocket to a terrifying level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, even a warrior like Dalia, who has reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, could be easily slain by him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the premise is that Osborne can truly unleash the power of the Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those hundreds of thousands of Empyrean Sacredness warriors outside are doomed, but their Empyrean Sacredness Bones can serve as nourishment for the Warfare Ancient Tree, making it stronger and accelerating the Bewitching Lantern's transformation into an Imperial Artifact," Primordial said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Make sure to collect those things later, don't let them go to waste."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hundreds of thousands of Empyrean Sacredness warriors outside were indeed finished. At this moment, ninety percent of them had already been killed by Dalia's tentacles and turned into dried corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Dalia's aura had become even more terrifying at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She won't directly break through to become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior because of this, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Adriana was definitely outside the Phantomagic Realm. Once Dalia broke through to become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, Adriana would be in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you afraid of Dalia breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial gave a faint smile, full of disdain. "Breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness? It's not that easy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although this monster can devour others' vital essence, soul power, and even potential, and after devouring these hundreds of thousands of people, it can indeed reach the energy threshold to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, she won't be able to break through in a short time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, the power of hundreds of thousands of people is vastly different and extremely mixed. It must go through multiple refinements to purify this power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If she forces a breakthrough, she'll undoubtedly die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this. "As long as she can't break through, that's good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I feel like the Phantomagic Realm is about to collapse, it should shatter any moment now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began to look forward to it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he noticed the edges of the Phantomagic Realm starting to turn transparent, and the entire space was rapidly dissipating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Phantomagic Realm is about to disappear!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement. After hiding for so long, he finally waited for the Phantomagic Realm to disappear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial urged anxiously, "Collect all the corpses before the Phantomagic Realm disappears! Otherwise, once it vanishes, the people of Inferno Planet will see what's happening here, and it will be harder for you to act!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne listened and immediately nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was still somewhat dangerous to go out at this time, taking the risk was necessary for the hundreds of thousands of Empyrean Sacredness warrior corpses and to help the Warfare Ancient Tree grow faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately left the small world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there were less than ten thousand people still alive in the entire Phantomagic Realm. Most of them were at primary Empyrean Sacredness or mid Empyrean Sacredness levels. They were all desperately fleeing for their lives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one noticed Osborne suddenly appearing in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Dalia didn't notice him at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also realized that the Phantomagic Realm was about to disappear, so she fully controlled those hundreds of tentacles, trying to kill everyone as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly took action. He used the ocular energy emitted by Satan's Eye to envelop the withered corpses, swiftly collecting them into Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides the corpses, Osborne also targeted their Dimensional Bags. He used ocular energy to envelop them, transferring those items into Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne moved quickly. More than half of the corpses in the Phantomagic Realm disappeared in no time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dalia finally noticed something was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She noticed that the corpses in the Phantomagic Realm would instantly vanish after being enveloped in a faint glow. This sight left her utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Following the direction of the glow, she quickly locked onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn you, how dare you show up again?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!" Dalia screamed angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She unleashed hundreds of tentacles, stabbing toward Osborne!</span></p><div class="pagination">
