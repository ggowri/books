  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin slowly lifted the corner of the red cloth, revealing what lay underneath bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His slow movements seemed designed to heighten everyone's curiosity, creating suspense. Osborne knew that Marvin was stalling for time on purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Showing off the&nbsp;divine artifact&nbsp;early?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was just an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin was simply buying more recovery time for&nbsp;Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted. "Does it matter? The&nbsp;Death Realm's damage to&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;cuts directly into his life force! That's not something he can just recover from easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unless he has a recovery technique like the&nbsp;Light of Redemption."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't care too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He watched Cuthbert closely, curious about what divine artifact lay beneath the red cloth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Marvin was stalling, he didn't dare take it too far. Finally, he pulled the cloth away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, everyone saw an ancient warhammer beneath it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hammer was etched with lightning-like patterns, and a faint energy emanated from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd stared at the warhammer in stunned silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could this be the legendary&nbsp;Hammer of Thor?" someone gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A voice rang out in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But another quickly refuted, "Impossible! There's no way it's the&nbsp;Hammer of Thor. Would the Williamson family give it away as a prize if it were?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The&nbsp;Hammer of Thor&nbsp;is one of the most powerful weapons in Norse mythology! It's one of the greatest divine artifacts. No one would ever part with it if they owned it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But it sure looks like the&nbsp;Hammer of Thor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As a&nbsp;lightning metahuman, I can feel the immense lightning energy from it! Even if it's not the&nbsp;Hammer of Thor, it's connected to it somehow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd continued to stare at the divine artifact, debating excitedly as it resembled the&nbsp;Hammer of Thor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne watched too, surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could feel the thick waves of lightning energy from the warhammer. Even his&nbsp;lightning elemental essence&nbsp;was stirring excitedly in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This divine artifact must contain immense lightning power! It can definitely amplify a&nbsp;lightning metahuman's&nbsp;strength tremendously!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is definitely a treasure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes gleamed with interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Marvin was stalling for&nbsp;Cuthbert, he hadn't lied about one thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The divine artifact the Williamson family had prepared as a reward wasn't ordinary. It was an exceptional piece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was seriously tempted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, no one could ever have too many divine artifacts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had already decided to help Rhett and Emma get their revenge. Now, after seeing this divine artifact, his desire to defeat&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;grew even stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin listened to the crowd's chatter with a smile, not interrupting them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, he finally spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no need to guess wildly. It's not the&nbsp;Hammer of Thor. That's one of the most powerful divine artifacts in legend. How could the Williamson family possibly own something like that? Even if we did, would we really give it away as a prize?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But it does resemble the&nbsp;Hammer of Thor. This is the&nbsp;Volt Hammer! Its power is terrifying. Each swing unleashes a powerful lightning bolt. The stronger the wielder, the more devastating the lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even I might not be able to withstand it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And it's not just for&nbsp;lightning metahumans. Anyone can use it. But&nbsp;lightning metahumans&nbsp;will be able to maximize their potential.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In any case, I can guarantee that this is no ordinary divine artifact. It's a rare treasure! Whoever defeats&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;will own the&nbsp;Volt Hammer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that the&nbsp;Volt Hammer&nbsp;has been revealed, I won't waste more time. Let's continue with the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony! Godsons, please begin your challenges!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Marvin slowly stepped down from the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had managed to buy almost ten minutes of recovery time for&nbsp;Cuthbert. Any further delay would risk upsetting the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Glancing at&nbsp;Cuthbert, he descended from the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert&nbsp;looked extremely serious, anger flashing in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ten minutes of rest had restored some of his strength, but the life force that Emma had drained from him remained unrecovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert&nbsp;shot a murderous glare at both Emma and Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he didn't have time to dwell on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A new challenger had already appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, it was&nbsp;Emi&nbsp;challenging him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to the Honor Quest Ceremony rules, the&nbsp;Godsons from the&nbsp;Godson Rankings&nbsp;would challenge&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;according to their rankings, from lowest to highest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi&nbsp;was originally ranked 499th on the&nbsp;Godson Rankings. After Isa claimed the top spot, she was pushed down to 500th.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was on the verge of falling off the&nbsp;Godson Rankings&nbsp;entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, she was the first&nbsp;Godson&nbsp;to challenge&nbsp;Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked coldly at&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;and said, "Let's fight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dark Realm!"</p><div class="pagination">
