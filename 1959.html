  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was momentarily stunned, convinced they must have misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly raised a barrier of divine power around them, as if worried someone might overhear, and then turned to Osborne with a serious gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this isn't the time for jokes! Do you have any idea what 10 thousand Miracle Elixirs represent? Do you understand..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, just take a look for yourself!" Osborne replied with a grin, handing the Dimensional Bag back to Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "It's just 10 thousand Miracle Elixirs! If that's not enough, I've got more! We absolutely must ensure that uncles and aunts break through to Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, I have so many Celestial Crystals now that the entire Hudson family can use them freely to boost their strength significantly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, Jethro gasped, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He peered into the Dimensional Bag, and when he saw the 10 thousand Miracle Elixirs inside, it felt like his breath had caught in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King with centuries of experience, he couldn't help but stare, utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary, Alicia, Nadia, and the others soon caught sight of the treasure within the Dimensional Bag, and they were equally astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every single one is a precious blue or red Miracle Elixir! This is exactly what we need to break through to Supernal Deity King! With this many, we can easily make the leap and still have plenty left over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement in the room was electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this many Miracle Elixirs, I'm confident we can all break through within a year or two at most!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in the same boat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might take a bit longer, but I'm sure I can pull it off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at everyone with a smile. "Actually, I have another secret!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their attention back to him, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have time power! I can accelerate time for you all... even for the entire Hudson family! We can speed things up by at least 100 times!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Jethro and the others were left in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Osborne possess rare spatial power, but he also had the even rarer time power, capable of providing the entire Hudson family with a time acceleration of at least a hundredfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant his time power was incredibly formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro gazed at Osborne, unable to hide his amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was increasingly baffled by his grandson. After all, they had been stunned by the two million Celestial Crystals he had given them, and now, just three months later, he casually produced over 10 thousand Miracle Elixirs along with time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was nothing short of extraordinary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jethro was overjoyed, grinning from ear to ear because Osborne was his grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fantastic! With a hundredfold time acceleration, 10 thousand Miracle Elixirs, and an endless supply of Celestial Crystals... the Hudson family is truly on the verge of a resurgence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give us three months, no, just one month, and we'll be back at the top, maybe even surpassing our previous peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community has twenty Dukedom Level Powers, and we've been at the bottom, but soon enough, the Hudson family will reclaim a spot in the top five! Maybe even the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jethro finished, the excitement in the room reached a fever pitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro, brimming with excitement, issued orders. "Zachary! Go announce that the Hudson family will no longer accept visitors starting today. We have important matters to attend to! Gather everyone from the border battlefield and bring them back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, we're going into seclusion for closed-door training! The initial timeframe is set for three months!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a hundredfold time acceleration, that translates to 300 months, 25 years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty-five years of resources at our disposal will elevate the Hudson family's strength tenfold, even a hundredfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary nodded eagerly. "Got it, Dad! I'll make the arrangements right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro turned to Osborne. "Osborne, the time acceleration is in your hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently. "Don't worry, Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, every member of the Hudson family received the message. No matter what they were doing, they rushed back to the family's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, the divine power barrier surrounding the Hudson family was activated to its maximum, sealing them off completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could enter! No one could leave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne applied the time acceleration effect over the entire Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, the acceleration reached an astonishing two hundred times! Just like Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This effect sent waves of excitement through Jethro and the others as they quickly began distributing resources and preparing for their closed-door training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family boasted a population of five million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne generously provided Jethro with one billion Celestial Crystals and 200 thousand Miracle Elixirs, all while Jethro looked on in awe before stepping into Hope Haven himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne needed to enter seclusion as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to take some time to consolidate his strength in preparation for his breakthrough to Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the Central Zone, the heart of Epochal Divine Peak lay in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive statue had long since collapsed, and debris littered the area like a battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the sound of shifting stones echoed, and then all the rubble was sent flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A disheveled figure emerged from the wreckage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Creation Herald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a mere avatar, but the true body of the Creation Herald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Towering and imposing, his sharp eyes burned with a hint of madness as he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, his face contorted with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bloodstrike Orb!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After so long, I've finally dispelled its power! But I've taken quite a beating myself and will need a while to fully recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, that tree is in worse shape than I am! At last, I've managed to break free from its grasp and regain my freedom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three hundred years! Three hundred years I was ensnared by that wretched tree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm finally free!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I regain my strength, this world has better brace itself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Creation Herald laughed maniacally and waved his hand, enveloping the entire Epochal Divine Peak in a thick fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Paramount Supreme Clan warriors exploring the area were instantly blasted away by a powerful force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the entire Epochal Divine Peak was shrouded in mist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could approach it again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment in Supreme Sovereign City, on a towering pagoda that reached straight into the clouds, a tall figure stood gazing toward the direction of Epochal Divine Peak, a frown creasing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Creation Herald is free now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This could complicate things! I need to pick up the pace! I must seize control of all of Celestara before he fully regains his strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his voice rang out across Supreme Sovereign City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Send my orders!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Dark Deity Legion forces are to accelerate toward the West Zone! In one month, we will launch a full-scale assault on the West Zone's Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within three months, we must occupy the West Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to resist will be mercilessly slaughtered!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
