  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's voice cut through the tension, taking on a serious tone. "Listen up, kid! This is a crucial moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is about to take root inside you, and that's going to cause some serious vibrations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thankfully, your body is perfectly suited for it, and with my help, the tremors should be minimal. But remember, this is the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity we're talking about! Even a slight disturbance could trigger a seismic event!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your body can't handle it, you could be done for right here. No one will be able to save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget&mdash;you're still just a Lesser God! Not even a Junior Deity yet. I have a feeling your body is pretty strong, but I can't guarantee it will withstand the vibrations from the Lotus. So, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious as he nodded in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it! I'll be on high alert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without Cain's warning, Osborne knew the stakes. He recalled the earth-shattering tremors when the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus were pulled from the ground. That time, the vibrations affected the mountains and valleys around him. But now, as the Lotus prepared to take root within his own body, the potential for </span><span>internal chaos loomed large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had confidence in his physical strength. Just over three months ago, Gerardo had told him his body's strength had reached an impressive 1100 points, surpassing the threshold of an average Junior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And after three months of slumber, his body had been rejuvenated and strengthened tenfold by the overwhelming fate power coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was sure his physical prowess exceeded that of a typical Junior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he couldn't be sure if he had reached the strength of a Level Three Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had seen the God of Stars' body, crafted by Isa, and it felt significantly stronger than his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness for Cain's support! I should be okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reassured himself, but a sense of wariness lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the Lotus homing in on his heart, just like the Blood Cross had done before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the Primordial Crimson Lotus manifested within his heart, a swirling mass of highly concentrated energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could expand to colossal proportions or shrink down to the size of a speck of dust at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, it matched the size of his heart perfectly, its roots beginning to descend, ready to take hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's vigilance heightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment it took root would be the most perilous, and he knew it was only a matter of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity settled into place, its roots making contact with Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It began to absorb the essence of his heart as if it were fertile soil, establishing its foothold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt his entire body convulse violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face drained of color as excruciating pain shot through his flesh, every pore erupting with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if a magnitude ten earthquake had detonated inside him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of blood rushed up his throat, but he managed to swallow it down, fighting against the wave of agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the petals of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Cain began to move, seemingly soothing the Cosmic Treasure, making its vibrations subside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity anchored themselves onto Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body ceased its tremors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exhaled, relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most perilous moment had passed, albeit somewhat raggedly, but no major issues arose. His body, sturdier than he had imagined, withstood the vibrations without sustaining severe damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain, watching from the sidelines, was utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, how on earth is your body so robust? The vibrations from the Primordial </span><span>Crimson Lotus of Eternity didn't just shatter you; they barely even hurt you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your body's resilience is comparable to a Level Three Divine Body! How is that possible? Are you really just a Lesser God? Maybe an Intermediate Deity, or even a Superior Deity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't even forged a Divine Body yet, yet his physical strength rivaled that of a Level Three Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scenario was unprecedented, even within the annals of the Age of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Cain, who had once been a Deity Overlord warrior, was shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered Osborne a bona fide freak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly pondered how to explain this phenomenon but was interrupted as his face suddenly paled. A mouthful of blood gushed forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The already anchored Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity began to vibrate wildly again, this time more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body convulsed under the strain, blood spurting out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! It's starting to fuse?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
