  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill those pathetic humans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All those Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs belong to us! The lowly Human Community doesn't deserve to possess them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're only fit to be our slaves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ambrose, take them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne revealed a stash of 10 thousand Celestial Crystals and five Miracle Elixirs, the representatives from the various superpowers erupted in fury, and their shouts echoed through the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "How dare these worthless humans possess such treasures that we can't obtain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, many in the crowd felt a surge of greed, but they restrained themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, with so many powerful clans present, any attempt to seize the treasures without a valid reason would only lead to ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young talents, including Ambrose, had their eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, great! I can't believe you actually have that many Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs! But don't worry. They'll soon belong to us! Now, let's kick off the arena battles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, waving his hand to store the treasures away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're brave enough, come and take them! If you can defeat us, all those Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs are yours. And if you manage to kill us, I have even more in reserve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just don't be surprised if you find you're not up to the challenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words only fueled their greed further, and their eyes shone with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose sneered, saying, "Great! Let's get this show on the road!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But first, let's lay down the rules for the arena battles. Since you lot&mdash;the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings&mdash;set the time and place, we'll decide the rules. Sound fair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, and his tone was calm. "You want to set the rules?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you scared?" Ambrose shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "No need to bait me. Just tell me what rules you have in mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose grinned, saying, "It's simple! We think one-by-one challenges are too tedious and waste too much time. You call yourselves the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and there's that Mystic Feather Clan loser who's joined you. Eight of you in total, so we'll send out eight of our best to face you in an all-out eight-on-eight battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The match ends when one side surrenders, is rendered unable to fight or is killed. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ambrose finished speaking, Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight-on-eight? Are you sure about that? You know, in a one-on-one scenario, you might have a chance to win a few rounds. But in an eight-on-eight match? You're likely to have no hope at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you rotated your fighters, you might struggle to take down any one of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce and the others joined in the laughter, but Ambrose merely scoffed, and his expression was one of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, you really are full of yourself! Do you think with all of us here, you wouldn't be able to take down even one of your group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! You must be out of your mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're so confident, let's do it your way! Let's show everyone just how much your pathetic Human Community can really boast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, laughter erupted from those around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all believed Osborne was just blowing hot air, failing to take his words seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ambrose and his crew represented the strongest young talents from their clans. While not every super genius was present, at least seventy to eighty percent of them had shown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea of so many warriors teaming up in a wheel battle to defeat even one member of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed impossible&mdash;absolutely out of the question!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the crowd was convinced that Osborne was just talking big and that, soon enough, he and his companions would be thoroughly defeated and humiliated by the young warriors from the various clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if you're set on it, then so be it!" Osborne shrugged. "If you want to embarrass your clans, who am I to stop you? Eight-on-eight it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bryce, Zoe, and the others behind him laughed heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a one-on-one wheel battle, they wouldn't have absolute confidence. After all, many warriors from the other clans posed a significant threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were sure of their abilities, they knew defeat was a possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But eight-on-eight? That changed everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bunch of fools! Do they really think they can take us on in an eight-on-eight? They're practically asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce sneered, glancing at Osborne, then at Hannah and Anastasia, feeling an overwhelming sense of reassurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a commanding voice cut through the air. "I don't agree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Mystic Feather Clan wants no part in this showdown between the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings and the other clans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, get over here right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to bring disaster upon Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the authoritative voice rang out, everyone turned to see the speaker standing on a Malevolence Airship adorned with Mystic Feather Clan's emblem, glaring coldly at Hannah.</span></p><div class="pagination">
