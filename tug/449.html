  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you really have to do it this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned, feeling speechless. He couldn't figure out what this woman was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I didn't do it this way, you'd forget me in no time," Yvonne said, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she bent closer to inspect the bite mark on his shoulder as if checking whether she'd bitten hard enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not bleeding... Let me try again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not satisfied with the faint redness, Yvonne leaned in and sank her teeth into his other shoulder, this time biting down even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pain was so intense that Marcus almost blacked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, seeing a hint of blood, Yvonne licked her lips in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmm... now you'll definitely remember me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uh..." Marcus was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After leaving the pharmaceutical industrial park, Marcus decided to visit the Mitchell Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace had recently reached Ancient Martial Stage One, and there were many nuances of cultivation she didn't yet understand. Marcus needed to guide her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as his car reached a quiet street, the faint sound of laughter, sinister and vulgar, reached his ears, accompanied by a woman's desperate cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus instinctively stopped the car and stepped out. Ahead, he saw a group of young men dragging a frail, slim young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men were dressed like street thugs, with garish, dyed hair and bodies covered in tattoos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was sweltering hot, and the young woman wasn't wearing much to begin with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, much of her top had been torn away, and if not for her bra, she would have been fully exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You little tramp," one of the men, a wiry guy with yellow hair, sneered. "Three months together, and you still won't let me touch you? Acting all pure and innocent? What a joke. Today, you're lucky Mr. Deleon's taken an interest in you. Get in the car now. If you please him, he might reward you with hundreds of thousands of dollars. "Doesn't your family need the money? I'm doing you a favor, and you're ungrateful? How pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young woman glared at him with hatred. With a sudden burst of anger, she slapped him across the face. "Gustavo, you're an animal! I'm your girlfriend. How could you do this to me? I can't believe I ever trusted you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears of heartbreak streamed down her face, her expression filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The slap enraged Gustavo. He struck her back with equal force, his voice dripping with venom. "Girlfriend? You call yourself my girlfriend? Every other guy's girlfriend lets their man do whatever he wants. You won't even let me hold your hand. You're nothing but a cheap fraud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to his companions, he barked, "Boys, no need to be gentle. Get this bitch in the car. Mr. Deleon's waiting, and when he's done, it'll be our turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Gustavo's words, the other men openly ogled the young woman's pale, trembling body, their eyes filled with lecherous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they started dragging her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nearby, a black Lexus LM500 was parked with the side door slightly ajar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, the pale, sallow face of a man could be seen, a face that spoke of overindulgence and excess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This, Marcus surmised, must be the Mr. Deleon Gustavo had mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' expression darkened, fury simmering in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What enraged him even more was recognizing the young woman being dragged away. It was none other than Kiera, Darian's sister-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's delicate face was marked with despair as she struggled against her captors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was barely in her twenties, small and fragile, and completely unprepared for such a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trapped by Gustavo, she had already resigned herself to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they dared violate her, she was determined to end her own life before they could succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold, commanding voice rang out from not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo and his gang turned toward the source of the voice and saw Marcus walking toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's teary eyes widened in disbelief when she saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald! It's really you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression was filled with hope and relief, but almost immediately, it turned to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Remembering who was in the Lexus, Kiera called out in alarm, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you need to leave! Gustavo and his friends may just be low-life thugs, but the man in that car is someone you can't afford to offend. I don't want to drag you into this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Marcus had previously saved the day at Solomia Hospital, even taking down Director Rollins from the city's government office, Kiera knew this was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From Gustavo's words, she had learned that the man in the Lexus belonged to the Deleon family of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Kiera's family wasn't wealthy, she knew what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deleons were the most powerful family in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Marcus was no ordinary man, the Deleon family was on an entirely different level.</span></p><div class="pagination">
