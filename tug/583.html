  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg let out a scoffing laugh, his gaze filled with contempt as he stared at Marcus. "Kid, I've been in this field for decades, and I've never heard anything like that. What do you know? Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Marcus' attempt to intervene, Berg remained unfazed, continuing with his </span><span>actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He insisted that the nurse inject adrenaline into Rodney without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the adrenaline shot was administered, the anticipated improvement didn't come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Rodney's condition seemed to worsen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rodney's body started twitching uncontrollably, his eyes rolling back as froth bubbled from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear&mdash;he was on the verge of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it. He's gone. Same thing happened with my grandfather. A minute or two, and that's it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, this guy's in bad shape. Even Dr. Nell can't save him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured, shaking their heads with a sense of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of them thought to blame Berg's methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg's face turned ashen, but he kept trying one rescue maneuver after another, all in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney had no pulse left. His heart had completely stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, please, wake up! Don't leave me like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina cried, her voice breaking as she collapsed over Rodney's lifeless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, her father had been fine, even out shopping for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could everything change so fast?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was overwhelming. Gina felt herself sinking under the weight of grief and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Berg Nell, with all his experience, seemed powerless to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was consumed by guilt and regret&mdash;she had failed to take better care of her father, and now it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina wept uncontrollably, her body shaking, but no matter how she screamed or begged, Rodney wouldn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when all hope seemed lost, Marcus knelt down and took Rodney's wrist in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you doing? My dad's dead, and now you're going to mess with him?" Gina shouted, trying to push Marcus away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, this felt like an insult to her father's memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want him to die, step aside!" Marcus said, his tone suddenly sharper than before, leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina froze, taken aback by Marcus' sudden shift in demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, just move. Let's see what this guy's got," Berg said, shooting Marcus a challenging glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg had tried everything he knew, and now he was genuinely curious to see if Marcus could do something that he couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus failed, then there'd be time enough for him to laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitant but desperate, Gina stepped aside, letting Marcus take control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a focused expression, Marcus began channeling the Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy flowed from his palms into Rodney's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power moved through Rodney's energy channels, circulating in a grand cycle, </span><span>finally focusing on his blocked aorta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blockage was severe, probably due to Rodney's long-standing habits of drinking and smoking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing it wouldn't be easy&mdash;it would take about 20 minutes, Marcus estimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus had Rodney swallow a special pill to help stabilize his condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combination of the pill and Marcus' Timeless Numinous Energy worked together, slowly revitalizing Rodney's vital signs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blockage in Rodney's aorta began to clear, little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' energy continued to flow, Rodney's complexion gradually turned from ashen to a healthy, natural color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney's breath, which had stopped moments ago, returned, and soon his chest rose and fell with a steady rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers couldn't believe their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see that? He was just about dead, and now he's breathing again! This is insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he was a goner, but now he's alive again. Who is this guy? What kind of crazy skills does he have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with disbelief, casting sideways glances at Marcus, their opinions of him changing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina, Berg, and the rest of the medical staff stood frozen, staring in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just minutes ago, Rodney's heart had stopped, and his breathing had ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, within ten minutes, both had returned. Could Marcus' medical skills really be this extraordinary?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more time passed, Rodney's condition continued to improve at an astonishing rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked like someone who had just received an incredible revitalizing tonic&mdash;his face flushed with health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing was deep and steady, and he looked nothing like the man who had just moments ago been on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each passing second, Marcus' energy had completely cleared the blockage in Rodney's aorta. The lifeblood that had seemed to slip away was now fully restored.</span></p><div class="pagination">
