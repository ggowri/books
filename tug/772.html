  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no interest in the choices others made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had warned them earlier, but they refused to listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, paying with their lives was simply the price of their arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Ada by his side, Marcus traversed the vast underwater expanse, arriving at an ancient city submerged in the ocean's depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was utterly dumbfounded. Her stunning face was filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus led her to the central altar of the city, using it as a gateway to transport them to the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tribe's chieftain, Raphael, along with his deputy Elliott and other high-ranking members, was already waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Marcus arrived, their faces lit up with reverence. They bowed deeply to </span><span>him,</span><span> their attitudes filled with utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left Ada in shock once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly noticed that the people of the Nuer Tribe were distinctly different from ordinary humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She guessed they were likely the legendary guardians of this underwater world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the tales, the Nuer Tribe had protected this oceanic realm for thousands of years and were its true rulers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had only entered this underwater world three days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was this mysterious tribe, bowing down to him as if he were a deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada could hardly wrap her mind around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Marcus with a mix of astonishment and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is this your friend? My, what a beautiful lady!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman stepped forward, grasping Ada's hand warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Princess Nadia of the Nuer Tribe," Marcus introduced, his tone calm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning that the woman before her was a princess, Ada was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly offered a polite greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, your taste is impeccable. This young lady is truly stunning. I like her already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another young woman, Susan, approached and joined Nadia in fawning over Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, Ada could sense that both Nadia and Susan shared a close connection with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well-acquainted with Marcus' personality. His reputation as a charmer who left trails of admirers in his wake was no secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised her, however, was that in just three days, Marcus had won over not one, but two of the most beautiful women in the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada found this both shocking and impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that not only was Marcus incredibly powerful, but his charm with women was far more potent than she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just three days, he had won the affection of the two most beautiful girls in the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was a princess, while the other clearly held an extraordinary status as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This truly shocked Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, ladies. You're both absolutely gorgeous," she replied with a polite smile, though her mind was racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the surface interaction appeared harmonious, there was an unmistakable undercurrent of rivalry between the three women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though not overtly hostile, each was keenly aware of the others, sizing up their respective positions in Marcus' life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the space-time gate is ready to be opened. Shall we proceed now?" Raphael asked respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a slight nod. "Let's begin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael immediately relayed the order to the tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will accompany Mr. Fitzgerald into the space-time gate. If anything happens to the tribe, use the amulet to contact me. I will return and shut the gate immediately," Raphael instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and the other leaders nodded in agreement. "Rest assured. We will follow your instructions to the letter," Elliott replied solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his concerns alleviated, Raphael led Marcus and Ada to the tribe's central area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a bird's-eye view, this was the very heart of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing tall in this space was a colossal statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It depicted a towering, muscular man wielding a trident, his presence exuding unparalleled strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure bore an uncanny resemblance to the sea god often depicted in ancient myths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but recall a movie he'd once seen in a cinema called The Sea God. The resemblance was striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the statue's shadow, Raphael's demeanor turned solemn. He offered a devout prayer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he began to chant an arcane incantation, the words incomprehensible yet brimming with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he chanted, mysterious forces converged, forming intricate patterns of light in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These forces materialized in the void, forming amulets that covered the entire sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These glowing symbols gathered over the statue, illuminating it with a divine brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The statue's enormous form suddenly began to glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A towering beam of light descended from above, enveloping the statue in a golden aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the radiance, the statue appeared even more majestic, an overwhelming sacredness emanating from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those without faith in the figure felt an almost irresistible urge to kneel before it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open!" Raphael's voice rang out with authority. At his command, a massive golden gate slowly materialized beneath the statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gate creaked open, releasing waves of powerful spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force was so intense that Marcus and the others had to brace themselves to avoid being sucked into the vortex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, this is the space-time gate. It will remain open for three days. After that, it will close automatically," Raphael explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone entering must either pass through to another world or return to this one within the time limit. Failing to do so will trap them in the space-time tunnel forever, lost for all eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> during this journey, we must ensure we return to the Nuer Tribe within three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded slightly. Without hesitation, he took Ada's soft hand and led her toward the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's nerves were palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard countless legends about the space-time gate but had never witnessed it herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing before this otherworldly portal, she was filled with a mix of curiosity and dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea what awaited her on the other side or whether this journey would bring fortune or disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, there was only one way to find out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stepped closer, the spatial forces enveloped them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their vision darkened, and a wave of dizziness overtook them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they opened their eyes again, they found themselves in a seemingly endless tunnel of time and space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tunnel stretched infinitely in both directions, surrounded by an abyss of darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Violent storms raged in distant pockets, tearing through the void with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One misstep could lead to being swept away by the chaos, never to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, those are space-time storms. We must tread carefully. No matter how powerful one is, getting caught in those will mean certain doom," Raphael warned from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a faint nod and pressed forward, unwavering.</span></p><div class="pagination">
