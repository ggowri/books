If you do, our store would be willing to pay you a penalty of 200 thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after paying the penalty, the shop would still make a profit of 300 thousand dollars&mdash;definitely a winning deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie firmly declined, "I've purchased this necklace, and I won't give it to anyone else. It belongs to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Josie had a gentle nature and preferred not to compete with others, this was a different situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail, Marcus's ex-wife, had been provoking her, successfully igniting Josie's competitive spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want a bigger payout, right? How about 11 million dollars? If you're willing to part with this necklace, I'll give you 11 million dollars!" the man offered a significantly higher amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that even a wealthy person like Josie would be tempted by more than a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie shook her head again, "This necklace is mine, and no amount of money will make me give it up. Just let it go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man frowned and replied coldly, "I'm warning you, don't push your luck. Do you have any idea who I am?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My uncle is Stephen Andrade, the new president of Sync Group. If you refuse to hand over that necklace, I'll make your life difficult here in Kingston!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion drew the attention of other customers at the counter, many of whom were visibly shocked by the revelation of his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group was a highly competitive, emerging tech industry leader in Kingston with a market value of 80 billion dollars, renowned throughout Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group once belonged to the Brown family of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ricardo's death, the group was acquired by a mysterious figure known as Death, who appointed Stephen as the new president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Stephen hold 10% of Sync Group's shares, but the Andrade family also had considerable influence in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Stephen had no children of his own, he raised his nephew, Julius Andrade, as his son, making Julius a wealthy figure in the high society of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, when people witnessed Josie arguing with Julius, many speculated that she would back down once his identity was revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Josie remained unyielding, stating, "Your identity doesn't concern me. I'll say it again: the necklace is mine, and I won't give it to anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she reached for the necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius grabbed her wrist and snatched it away, saying, "You bitch. I've already been more than accommodating; what more do you want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who shows up today, that necklace belongs to Abigail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Julius looking so domineering, Abigail couldn't help but wink at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius immediately felt proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could revel in his victory, Marcus kicked him in the abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius cried out in pain, releasing his grip and collapsing to the floor, groaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swiftly snatched the necklace back, took out a wet wipe, and meticulously cleaned it before placing it around Josie's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once adorned with the limited-edition necklace, Josie looked extraordinarily elegant and stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie gazed at Marcus with admiration in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Abigail's expression darkened. She scoffed, "Marcus, this is what you got? Resorting to violence whenever you face a problem? You'll never achieve anything significant that way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the nephew of Mr. Stephen Andrade, the president of Sync Group. Now that you've hit him, you'll have to face the consequences from Mr. Andrade!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Abigail helped Julius up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After catching his breath, Julius shouted at Marcus, "You loser! I'll ruin you and that bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached for his phone, ready to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice from the crowd broke through, "That woman looks familiar. Oh, I remember now; I saw her on TV!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the founder of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals and a representative of outstanding female entrepreneurs in Kingston, Ms. Josie Shelman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, that's who she is! No wonder she's so beautiful and graceful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though Julius is Stephen's nephew, he may not be able to touch Ms. Shelman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing the comments from those around her, Abigail asked with concern, "Mr. Julius Andrade, which is better: BioFusion Pharmaceuticals or your uncle's Sync Group?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
