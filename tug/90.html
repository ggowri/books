  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie stood up and opened the door, finding her in-laws returning with her daughter, Leia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, what brings you here?" Josie asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the weekend, and Leia didn't have school, so her grandparents had taken her earlier that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This child wouldn't listen, insisting on finding her mother, so Vincent and I brought her back," Janet explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on in, then," Josie gestured, stepping aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that her parents noticed Marcus, who was sitting on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a glance and a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, this young man is your lifesaver! Without him, you would have been long gone!" Janet exclaimed as she quickly introduced Marcus to her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent immediately stepped forward, his hand reaching out to Marcus with excitement. "Young man, thank you so much! It's really you, just as I imagined!" he said, shaking Marcus's hand firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved it off modestly. "No need to thank me, sir. You're Josie's father-in-law, so helping you was the least I could do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dear, go prepare some food. I'm having a drink with this young man!" said Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet headed to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, a table full of delicious food was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, in high spirits, kept filling Marcus's glass and serving him dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus enjoyed the lively conversation, realizing that Vincent was a man of character and had once been a soldier on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a hearty meal, Josie was pulled into another room by Janet and Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, I think this young man is a great match for you. Vincent and I both approve. You should go after him, Leia deserves a father!" Janet said earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, what are you talking about? Marcus is just a client. Plus, he's young, accomplished, and I'm just a single mother. How could I ever be a match for someone like him? We could never be together!" Josie protested, shaking her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not? You're capable, a well-known entrepreneur from Kingston. I'm a woman too, and I know how these things work. You should see the way he looks at you. If you like him, go for it. Otherwise, you'll regret it for the rest of your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie longed to pursue him, but she was too aware of their differences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending a few days with Marcus, she realized she had fallen deeply in love with the charming, handsome man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the gap between them was simply too large, and Josie didn't want to be a burden on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would rather bury her feelings deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Josie personally took Marcus to the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the plane took off, Josie couldn't contain the sorrow in her heart, and a tear fell down her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus returned to Solomia, Diana drove a sleek luxury car of Alphard to pick him up from the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, Marcus was satisfied with his trip to Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he successfully rescued Natalia, but he had also eliminated Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, after defeating the wizard Johnson, Marcus had gained a wealth of valuable spoils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides a few magical gemstones, two powerful spell books, Fireball and Lightning, had immense value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more crucially, the production line issue at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals had been resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the factory was completed, the ten production lines would be ready to go, with annual output expected to reach a hundred billion dollars and net profits exceeding ten billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a scale could rival the leading pharmaceutical company, TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the products gained recognition, Marcus planned to expand production and aim for the top three positions in the pharmaceutical industry of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning to Solomia, Marcus didn't head straight to Bayside Villa but instead visited the construction site of the pharmaceutical company first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The foundation was already laid, and all necessary materials were in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thousands of workers and large machines were busy, creating a scene of bustling activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle briefed Marcus on the progress, and he was pleased with the pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, the factory would be completed in less than three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then visited Charles to discuss the first batch of pharmaceutical products for the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a well-known internal medicine professor in Solomia, Charles recommended that Marcus focus on producing internal medicine drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles was highly knowledgeable about drug patents and provided Marcus with a list of medications to choose from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, Charles offered some of his own patented drugs for Marcus to produce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, eager to pay the patent fees, was surprised when Charles refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Charles's eyes, Marcus was like a son-in-law to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles believed that a son-in-law was half a son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking care of Marcus was like taking care of his daughter, Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne, ever attentive, had been by Charles's side the entire time, happy to see Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But noticing that his mind was fully absorbed in business, she refrained from interrupting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Mr. Miller, who managed your pharmaceutical company before? Where was it registered?" Marcus inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles answered, "Yvonne founded the company, and she's been managing it. The company is registered abroad in Acoton."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see," Marcus said thoughtfully, his mind racing with ideas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that TreatMed Pharmaceuticals has been pressuring your company recently. How about this: our two companies merge, and Yvonne can run the new one I've established.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can split the profits 60/40. What do you think, Mr. Miller?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
