  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If things got out of hand, Scales and Sheila would suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, hearing Catherine's words, Scales and Sheila both showed sarcastic smiles on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila put her hands on her waist and said, "Catherine, stop talking nonsense. Do you think that Marcus is powerful just because he has some money? Scales asked someone from Serpent's Coil here. Even if Marcus has money, he will be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing these words, many people couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never expected that Scales knew someone from Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Serpent's Coil was the leading gang in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their view, Golden Group was a company doing legitimate business. Even though Marcus had a powerful position in Golden Group, he was just an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he faced those desperate people from Serpent's Coil, he would be in great danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sheila, stop talking nonsense to him. Toby will be here in two minutes. I will make this guy beg me," Scales said with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was forced into a corner by Marcus. Otherwise, he would not have thought of such a desperate approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily, who was not far away, watched all this with a gloating look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for Marcus, his girlfriend would have been arranged by Scales to work at Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All this was caused by Marcus, and he hated Marcus very much, but he had no place to vent his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Scales had asked Toby from Serpent's Coil here, and Marcus would pay the price for his arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Baily thought of the scene where Marcus' arm was chopped off, he felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the door of the room was kicked open, and Scales, who was blocking the door, was knocked off balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby led a dozen people from Serpent's Coil in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recently, everyone in Serpent's Coil had been practicing Magic Codex, and their temperament had been changing silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Toby, you are finally here. This damned guy has cut off my source of income. Please cut off his arms, and I will pay you five million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales raised his hand and pointed to where Marcus was, saying with gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby smiled, "No problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand to the subordinates behind him and said, "Guys, come on. Press that guy onto the table and break both of his arms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several people swarmed over and quickly surrounded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some female classmates were so scared that they screamed and hid in the corner, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some of Marcus' classmates who had lost jobs at Golden Group felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to see the miserable scene that would happen to Marcus next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the people of Serpent's Coil were reluctant to take action. When they saw Marcus' appearance, they began to tremble in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell are you guys doing? Just do it. There's another mission later. Hurry up and chop off his hands." Toby urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Marcus had his back to the door, Toby could only see Marcus' back and was unable to recognize him for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Toby, this person seems to be..." A man said with a trembling body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps because he was too scared, he couldn't say anything in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who? Can you speak clearly?" Toby became impatient and urged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald." The young man finally said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other people from Serpent's Coil were also trembling in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never expected that the person whose arm Scales asked them to cut off would be Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if struck by lightning, Toby almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly took a step forward and saw Marcus' appearance clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is it you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was still half lying on the chair, with his legs crossed, and he didn't even look at Toby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Toby, do it!" Scales urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was eager to see Marcus' miserable end, and he was also afraid that Toby would know Marcus' position in Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, he didn't know whether Toby would go back on his word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Scales finished speaking, Toby slapped him in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The slap was so powerful that Scales was knocked flying backward, hitting the wall hard and breaking several of his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wasn't Toby asked here by Scales?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did he suddenly attack Scales?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales covered his swollen face and asked Toby in confusion, "Toby, you hit the wrong person. Hit that guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby took a step forward and slapped Scales twice more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why did you ask me to chop off Mr. Fitzgerald's arm? You idiot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Listen to me, Mr. Fitzgerald is someone that everyone in Serpent's Coil needs to respect. Are you looking for death?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
