  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's expression turned pale with shock as she struggled desperately to break free, but she couldn't. Marcus's grip tightened, making her face flush from the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Marcus pulled her toward him with such force that Silvia had no control over her body. She let out a startled cry as she was pulled into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's arms wrapped around her tightly, enveloping her completely. The overwhelming presence of his masculinity surrounded Silvia, making her heart race, while her breath seemed to freeze in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her first time being so close to a man, and she hadn't expected it to feel this way&mdash;strangely&hellip; not as unpleasant as she'd imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, her instincts still drove her to struggle fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me, you scoundrel! I'll kill you!" Silvia shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, feeling the softness of her body and the faint, pleasant scent emanating from her, made a subtle, almost playful sniffing gesture, which only intensified her discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You smell so nice&hellip;" Marcus muttered, his expression one of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's face turned red with anger as she glared at him, gathering all her energy to unleash a powerful strike. She focused her power into her palm, intending to strike Marcus with a hidden attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could act, Marcus's large hand seized her wrist with perfect precision, not even looking at her hand but somehow predicting her movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned, unable to understand how he was so accurate. His strength and foresight were far beyond what she could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're quite the looker, but why all the anger? Submission is what you should be doing," Marcus said, his smile broadening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll never submit to you, you scoundrel! Unless you kill me first!" Silvia gritted her teeth, her hatred clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You agreed to this, didn't you? According to our arrangement, you should submit to me," Marcus said, his gaze lingering on her, his eyes subtly moving lower, where the neckline of her dress offered a fleeting glimpse of her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was your side of the agreement! I never agreed to anything! Let me go!" Silvia shouted, realizing Marcus's lecherous look. She felt disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that Marcus would be so shameless, and his level of shamelessness was even stronger than what her cousin, Ada said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Marcus's hand suddenly struck her bottom, causing her body to tremble and letting out a surprised cry. The sting of the slap left her face flushed with both embarrassment and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scoundrel, how dare you do that?!" she yelled, attempting to resist, but Marcus slapped her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force made her body tremble once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you took off her clothes, you could see that after these two slaps, two big fingerprints would have appeared on her buttocks, and they were red and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though painful, she couldn't ignore the strange, conflicting sensation building inside her. The pain was mixed with an inexplicable pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart beat faster and she felt an indescribable desire in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if she was longing to be slapped by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, your butt is really soft but firm. I like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus simply ignored Silvia's protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his hand directly moved to Silvia's bottom, gently caressing and occasionally slapping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Silvia gasp in surprise, and her pretty face suddenly reddened further. Her body also began to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus's movements became more intense, Silvia's breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it... You can't do this to me, I'm the cousin of Ada..." she sobbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia struggled with all her might, but for some reason, the more Marcus grew bold with her, the stronger the strange desire seemed to become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her body trembled, the feeling of longing within her became harder to suppress. Before she could utter another word, Marcus leaned down and pressed his lips against Silvia's. In that instant, Silvia felt as though she had been struck by an electric shock, her body shuddering as her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation that spread from their kiss left Silvia feeling weak, her body responding with involuntary, shallow breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands instinctively pressed against Marcus's chest, but as his actions grew more intense, Silvia felt her strength fading, her body growing limp, unable to resist any longer</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard, let go of me&hellip; you can't do this&hellip; I have a fianc&eacute;&hellip; you can't&hellip;' Silvia continued to struggle, but the desire inside her grew stronger with each passing moment. Her body grew weaker, her breaths coming in heavier gasps. Despite her struggles, an unfamiliar longing began to stir within her</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia was utterly confused by her own reaction, even cursing herself for being lustful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she have such thoughts about a vile, disgusting man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was forcing himself on her, and she should have been repulsed to the point of vomiting. So why was her body responding to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was supposed to be with her fianc&eacute;. And her fianc&eacute; had been trying to have that kind of relationship with her for a long time. But she had forcefully rejected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, facing Marcus's relentless advance, Silvia felt as if she could no longer hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it matter to me if you have a fianc&eacute;?" Marcus lifted his lips and placed his hand on Silvia's chest, gently caressing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, Silvia's face was flushed, her breathing becoming heavier, with her chest rising and falling with each breath. The rhythm adding to the intensity of the moment. As Marcus's hands squeezed her breasts, he could feel the softness and the curves beneath his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he touched her nipples, Marcus could feel they had hardened. He couldn't resist gently pinch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus's fingers made contact, Silvia felt a jolt of sensation, as if she had been struck by electricity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop&hellip; you can't do this&hellip; I have a fianc&eacute;&hellip; if he finds out&hellip; he'll kill you&hellip;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming sensation made her let out a soft moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scoffed. "Then I'd be curious to see what your fianc&eacute; is really capable of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus noticed Silvia repeatedly mentioning her fianc&eacute;, and it only seemed to spark his competitive side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the sensation beneath his hands seemed to captivate Marcus, drawing him in further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept kneading her full breasts, but since the fabric was in the way, it seemed to leave Marcus unsatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift movement, Marcus pulled down Silvia's shirt from the collar, the fabric slipping to her shoulders and revealing more of her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially with the delicate fabric of her undergarment covering the fullness beneath, the sight was enough to draw Marcus's attention, adding to the tension of the moment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
