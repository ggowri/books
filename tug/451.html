  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smirked, his expression full of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at Grace's house, he had taught Randy a hard lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy carried far more weight than someone like Heath, who was just a distant relative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And yet, Heath dared to act arrogant in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' words made Heath's face darken instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While he took pride in being part of the Deleon family, being called out as a side branch member was a sore spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deleon family hierarchy was notoriously rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Figures like Randy and Oliver were the epitome of the family's elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver, especially, was regarded as the family's shining star, with the patriarch himself grooming him to be the next head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Oliver's heart was set on a military career, leaving little interest in family affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, neither Oliver nor Randy was someone Heath could compare himself to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't an exaggeration to say that if Randy so much as sneezed, Heath wouldn't dare to call it an annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And yet, here in Solomia, Heath strutted around like he owned the place, wearing his Deleon name like a crown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, you've got some nerve, insulting our young master like that. Today, you're going to learn your lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of Heath's bodyguards stepped forward, pulling a pistol from his waistband and aiming it at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo's face lit up with glee. His smugness returned, and he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, look who's in trouble now. I told you not to mess with Mr. Deleon, but you wouldn't listen. What now? Think you're tougher than a gun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Gustavo, Heath pulling out a gun was the ultimate show of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He imagined Marcus trembling in fear any second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kneel and apologize to Mr. Deleon, or I'll put a bullet in your head!" the bodyguard barked, his tone leaving no room for negotiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's face turned pale with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Marcus was strong, but against a man with a gun, even he wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She instinctively moved to shield Marcus, ready to take the consequences herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus simply gestured for her to stay calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you believe," Marcus said with a cold smile, "that I could kill you before you even pull the trigger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were met with a chorus of laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must be out of your damn mind!" the bodyguard spat. "You think you're faster than a bullet? What are you, Superman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He aimed the gun at Marcus' forehead, his tone filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the laughter hadn't died down when Marcus moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a flash, his figure blurred, leaving afterimages as he closed the distance in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguard's face twisted in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tried to pull the trigger, but Marcus struck his wrist with a lightning-fast blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of bones shattering filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gun clattered to the ground as the bodyguard screamed in pain. Before he could recover, Marcus' hand clamped around his throat, cutting off his cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man's eyes widened in terror. He couldn't fathom how Marcus had moved so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he wasn't the only one. Gustavo, Heath, and the remaining bodyguards stared in stunned silence, paralyzed by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all ordinary people, and Marcus' strength was beyond their imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"L-let me go..." the bodyguard croaked, his face contorted in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't respond. Instead, he tightened his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another sickening crunch echoed as Marcus crushed the man's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His lifeless body crumpled to the ground, eyes frozen in disbelief at his sudden demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo and Heath gasped audibly, their faces pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other bodyguards hesitated only briefly before drawing their guns, ready to fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus moved faster than they could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within moments, he was upon them, striking with brutal precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sounds of gunfire never came. Instead, the room echoed with the sickening thuds of bodies hitting the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In mere seconds, Marcus had incapacitated the remaining guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some lay groaning with broken bones; others were dead, their lives snuffed out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything happened so quickly. Though it seemed complicated, it happened in just a blink of the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The seamless, deadly efficiency left Gustavo and Heath dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Kiera, who knew Marcus was strong, covered her mouth in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These are the bodyguards you hired?" Marcus asked mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, he began walking toward Heath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sweat beaded on Heath's forehead. His voice trembled as he tried to muster a warning. "I'm a member of the Deleon family! If you lay a hand on me, they won't let you live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smirked coldly. "I don't care if you're from the Deleon family or anywhere else. If you mess with my people, even your so-called untouchable family will suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Heath could react, Marcus delivered a brutal kick to his groin.</span></p><div class="pagination">
