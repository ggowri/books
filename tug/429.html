  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Orion, at your service, Mr. Fitzgerald," the words rang out, reverberating through the tense air, causing Director Rollins and Darian to flinch as though struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was happening here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader of the Death Syndicate, Orion, was brought in by Director Rollins. But instead of taking action against Marcus, he was bowing deeply in respect, referring to Marcus as his superior, as though Marcus were the one in charge. The entire scene was unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, unfazed, turned to Orion and casually asked, "It's been a while since I've checked in. How's the Death Syndicate doing these days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orion, still bent in deference, spoke in measured tones, reporting on the Syndicate's operations with painstaking care, his voice laden with respect and caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was making sure not to show any signs of insolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Director Rollins stood in stunned silence, utterly bewildered by the turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice finally broke through the tension, sharp and incredulous. "Mr. Webb, what's going on here? Even if you're not willing to help me, there's no need to grovel before a young man like this. Who is he, really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't think you're hearing me, Rollins," Orion's voice cut through the air, calm but menacing. "Mr. Fitzgerald is not someone you can afford to cross. So shut your mouth now, or even with your position, I'll still take you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was icy, filled with an edge of unspoken threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right. I'll be respectful and call you Mr. Webb, but let's get one thing straight&mdash;you're just a dog in the underworld. You really think you're someone special?" Rollins retorted, his pride flaring up despite the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait until I get back to City Hall. I'll have the police raid the Death Syndicate and clean house!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orion's eyes darkened with the mention of a police raid, his voice rising with barely contained anger. "You have no idea what you're messing with, Rollins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd gathered around was growing, whispering among themselves, drawn to the confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spectacle was unlike anything they'd seen before&mdash;a high-ranking government official going head-to-head with a notorious gang boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The question on everyone's mind was simple who would come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the crowd, however, leaned toward Rollins, given his position within the Solomia government, while Orion and his syndicate were seen as part of the city's criminal underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before anything else could escalate, a new voice broke through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You won't be going back to City Hall," a calm but forceful voice called from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone turned to see Amelia, accompanied by a group of men in business attire, walking swiftly toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd quickly recognized the Department of Justice insignia on the jackets of those behind her. Amelia, with her icy composure, had brought backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rollins' gaze narrowed as he saw Amelia approaching. His instincts screamed that something was off, but he refused to show any weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Amelia, what's the meaning of this?" he demanded, his tone still commanding despite the unease settling in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amelia met his eyes coldly. "You're under investigation for bribery, embezzlement, and abusing your office to aid others, causing severe harm to the public. We have gathered all the evidence needed to prove your corruption. I am here to arrest you on behalf of the Mayor's office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't miss a beat as she gestured for the Department of Justice personnel behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, they surged forward, overwhelming Rollins before he could even react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cold, unfeeling snap of handcuffs locked around his wrists, and the gravity of the situation finally hit him. As he struggled, Rollins' defiance flared. "I'm the Director of the City Government Office! You're just a secretary. How dare you arrest me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amelia's lips curled into a bitter smile. "I'm arresting you because I have Mayor Benjamin's orders," she said coolly, pulling a document from her folder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The paper was stamped with the official seal of the city government, and there, in bold ink, was Benjamin's signature&mdash;a warrant for Rollins' arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The realization hit Rollins like a punch to the gut. His mind raced in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only had he crossed the line with Marcus, but it was now clear the city had been gathering evidence on him for some time. His position, his power&mdash;it all crumbled in an instant. His entire career, once so secure, was now in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What I don't understand," Rollins muttered, his voice strained with a mix of frustration and disbelief, "is why you waited until now to move. Why not earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amelia's response was as blunt as it was final. "Because you crossed the wrong person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words were like a thunderclap, shocking both Rollins and Jerry to the core. They couldn't believe their ears. The 'wrong person'&mdash;was that Marcus? The realization swept over them like a wave, and suddenly, everything made sense. Their arrogance, their earlier defiance&mdash;all of it had been rooted in a fatal mistake. If only they hadn't underestimated Marcus, they might not have ended up in this position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was too late now. Rollins was already in the grip of the law, and with the city's investigation into his corruption, his fate seemed sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take him away," Amelia said, her voice final.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officers quickly escorted Rollins away, but not before he gave Marcus a final, defiant look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus offered a calm, respectful nod in return, his face a mask of neutrality, but his eyes gleamed with a subtle satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Rollins was led away, Jerry stood frozen, his mind reeling. Watching his uncle being dragged off in handcuffs, a sense of dread settled over him. The world he had once known&mdash;his uncle's power, his place in the city&mdash;was unraveling before his eyes. Everything he had taken for granted was gone, and now he was left to face the consequences.</span></p><div class="pagination">
