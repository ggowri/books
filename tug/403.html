  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, what are you talking about? Marcus and I didn't do anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine didn't know how to face her father, so she made excuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Philip smiled, "Catherine, since last time, I have acknowledged Marcus as my son-in-law. Even if you two do something, I won't stop you. Why are you so shy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, he walked out of the room with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine's face turned red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought she couldn't do that at home next time. It would be embarrassing if her parents caught them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't say anything. After having breakfast at Catherine's house, he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They agreed to go to buy a new house in Solomia in three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marcus returned to Bayside Villa, he heard the sound of water in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the glass window of the bathroom, he could vaguely see a charming figure taking a bath inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, the sound of water stopped, and the bathroom door opened a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tender hand stretched out. "Pearl, get me a bath towel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person was Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wanted to return to his room quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he found that Pearl wasn't in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He picked up the towel on the sofa and walked to the bathroom, preparing to hand it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The bathroom is so hot. I need to get some fresh air."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Marcus was about to hand the towel in, Diana opened the bathroom door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, her perfect figure was revealed before Marcus' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had just had sex with Catherine last night, he still had an erection when he saw the naked Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah... Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was startled and hurriedly snatched the bath towel from Marcus' hand, trying to cover her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But somehow, Marcus couldn't suppress the desire in his heart, and he rushed into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took Diana's body into his arms and kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes widened. Her hands softened, and the bath towel that was about to wrap her body slipped off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body was naked, and under Marcus' kiss, her body quickly responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she moaned softly, her body gradually became soft, and a blush appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, don't do this... Pearl will be back soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana begged for mercy while responding to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stimulation from the touch of their lips made her sink into it quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus closed the bathroom door and locked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he became even bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While kissing Diana's mouth, he squeezed her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana resisted at first, but as the stimulation increased, her body collapsed in Marcus' arms. As her lower body became wet, the faint scent of roses came over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The smell made Marcus' inner desire have nowhere to vent, and he had a complete erection at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He put his hand on Diana's buttocks, and every time he squeezed them, Diana moaned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was not content to touch the buttocks. Then he followed the gap and touched the mysterious area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When touched by Marcus' hand, Diana was shaking, and the area also shrank rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A hot current surged out and wrapped around Marcus' fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scent of roses also became stronger at this time. Marcus pushed Diana against the bathroom wall and kissed every inch of her skin desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana closed her eyes and opened her mouth slightly. Under Marcus' stimulation, she completely fell into endless desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus quickly took off his pants, and his penis was already erect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as he was about to insert it into the hole, there was a knock on the bathroom door. "Diana, I just went to the bathroom because of a stomachache. I didn't hear you call me just now. Now I brought the towel over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Pearl's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her voice, Marcus and Diana immediately became much more sober.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at Marcus and said to Pearl outside the door, "Pearl, put the bath towel outside. I already have one. You go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pearl blinked her innocent eyes, thinking, "I just heard Diana ask for a bath towel. How come she has one suddenly? She must have walked out of the bathroom to get it herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Pearl went upstairs to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, it's your fault. Pearl almost saw us. I don't want to talk to you anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face flushed red, and under Marcus' teasing, her voice was trembling slightly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
