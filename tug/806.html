  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... this is all about Mr. Ashford? And it's so detailed... Where the hell did this </span><span>guy get this?" someone whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable. I always thought Mr. Ashford was untouchable. To think he'd be involved in something this dirty..." another muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has to be fake, right? There's no way Mr. Ashford would stoop this low. But... if it's real..." one person trailed off, their disbelief palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me you think things like this happen out of thin air. Just look at the file&mdash;it's way too detailed. Even if someone wanted to frame Mr. Ashford, there's no way some of this isn't true!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs in the lobby grew louder as more people gathered to watch the spectacle unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd swelled with curious onlookers, all whispering about the audacity of the young man challenging Pablo Ashford so publicly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's face darkened visibly, his jaw tightening as he stared at the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea where Marcus had gotten the document, but its contents were too precise, too damning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a fleeting moment, a thought crossed his mind&mdash;had Marcus somehow been watching him? Monitoring his every move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus broke the tension with a cutting smirk. "Well, Mr. Ashford, care to explain? These events look awfully familiar. You must've worked pretty hard to frame Mayor Benjamin Mitchell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's face twisted into a scowl. He glared at Marcus and growled, "Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled dryly, his expression calm and confident. "Who I am doesn't really matter. I'm not here to make trouble, Ashford. All I want is for you to drop the charges against Mr. Mitchell and release him. Do that, and this file? Poof. It'll disappear like it never existed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's icy gaze lingered on Marcus, the fury in his eyes barely contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella jumped in, her voice dripping with disdain. "Mr. Ashford, this guy's full of it. That file has to be fake. He's blatantly defaming you. He should be arrested and thrown in jail immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's face twisted into a sneer as he turned back to Marcus. "You hear that? You think you can waltz in here with some fabricated documents and accuse me? You're delusional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me be clear&mdash;you're not leaving this building today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo raised a hand, signaling to the guards. "Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards sprang into action, closing in on Marcus and Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch. Instead, he laughed, a sharp, mocking sound. "Wow, Mr. Ashford. </span><span>So</span><span> this is how you handle accountability? Use your power to silence anyone who calls you out? Classy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo straightened his shoulders, his confidence radiating. "This is how the world works, kid. The strong make the rules, and the weak? They suffer. You're out of your league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cocked an eyebrow, unfazed. "You're seriously sitting here thinking no one can touch you? That you're invincible just because of your title?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's smirk widened. "What's that supposed to mean? You think you can call in someone bigger than me? Go ahead, entertain me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella snorted loudly, crossing her arms. "Mr. Ashford, don't waste your time humoring him. Look at him&mdash;he's just some nobody from the middle of nowhere. He's obviously bluffing. This is all just a pathetic attempt to get attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ripple of laughter and nods of agreement spread through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Marcus was just another fool biting off more than he could chew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' smile didn't waver. He pulled out his phone, his tone calm but firm. "Oh, don't worry. Since you're so confident, let me make a call. Just don't regret it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Marcus stepped to the side, dialing Julian Ashford's number with deliberate precision.</span></p><div class="pagination">
