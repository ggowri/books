  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just wanted to grab a drink," Natalia replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you home," Marcus offered, opening the door to his Alphard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she slid into the plush seat, Marcus started the engine, steering the car toward the Winchester Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going back to the Winchester Villa. I'm done living there," Natalia quickly interjected, her tone firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not? Isn't that your home?" Marcus asked, genuinely curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've cut ties with Abigail. She's not my sister anymore..." Natalia bit her lip, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced over at her, noticing the redness in her eyes, but he kept silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Natalia broke the silence. "Aren't you curious about what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to talk about it, I'm all ears," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fists clenched in frustration as she recounted her story, saying, "Abigail wanted me to sleep with Felix to make him happy! Can you believe that? It made me feel sick, so I refused. She went off on me, and after a huge fight, I moved out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt his anger rise at the thought of Abigail treating her sister that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What a heartless move. I can't believe Abigail'd do that to her own sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you staying now?" he asked, his concern deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charaling Road," Natalia answered, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' heart sank. Charaling Road was known as one of Solomia's slums&mdash;dirty, dangerous, and filled with all sorts of unsavory characters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to believe Natalia had ended up there, but given her fallout with Abigail and Jane's neglect, it made a grim kind of sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Marcus pulled up outside a rundown rental unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wanna invite me in for a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia opened the door and gestured for him to come inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped inside, immediately hit by the musty smell of mildew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Natalia flicked on a dim light, the room came into view&mdash;a dilapidated worker's dormitory from the 1990s, long overdue for repairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ceiling leaked, paint peeled from the walls, and cockroaches scuttled across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from a bed and a rickety desk, the place was bare, with a makeshift clothesline strung up, holding her intimate garments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a bit shabby, so don't judge me," Natalia said, offering an apologetic smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dim light, Marcus couldn't help but feel a wave of pity wash over him as he took in her situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, he wrapped his arms around Natalia, pulling her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey..." she murmured, instinctively resisting for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she realized Marcus wasn't letting go, she relaxed into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes locked, and the air between them thickened with unspoken tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for today..." Natalia whispered, a flush creeping across her delicate features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could feel her heart racing against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could respond, Natalia leaned in and kissed him, her soft tongue slipping past his lips, igniting a fire within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist the allure, Marcus pushed her back onto the bed, kissing her fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia eagerly matched his intensity, her eyes glazing over as she let out soft, intoxicating moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... I want you to treat me like you did that day..." she breathed, her words sending a jolt through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of their passionate encounter flooded his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, Natalia's masochistic tendencies unleashed a primal desire within Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though wild, it only dawned on Marcus later that she was a virgin then, and he had taken her innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling that night now, amidst the charged atmosphere, Marcus was completely undone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he gave in to his urges, Natalia took control, mounting and dominating him. Straddling Marcus with her legs around his hips, she flung her hair back and slid off his trousers before taking his dick into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shuddered, nearly losing control in that instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia went wild, performing deep-throat maneuvers with abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for knowing Natalia was a virgin before, Marcus would have suspected she was a seasoned pro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blowjob skills were impressively professional!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' teasing, Natalia was already soaking wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the moment was right, Marcus prepared to move in for more intimate exchanges when a loud knock interrupted the charged atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Bob, the one who just chopped off three fingers! Come out if you've got the guts, don't be a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brow furrowed as he got up from Natalia, pulled on his clothes, and prepared to confront the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia straightened her rumpled skirt and, with a worried look, asked Marcus, "What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes flashed with murderous intent as he reassured her, "Don't worry, I've got this."</span></p><div class="pagination">
