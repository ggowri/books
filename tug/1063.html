  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Alison stirred from her coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ravaged beyond recognition, her body lay limp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lecher, how can you be so shameless? What is in it for you to do this to me? All you've gained is a powerful enemy," she rasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's this powerful enemy you're talking about? You?" Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me and Mr. Roger Gellar," Alison said flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked, "Honestly, you're no threat to me. You'll never be a danger in this lifetime. As for Roger, we're bound to clash eventually. Even without you, our feud wouldn't end. Isn't that right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison's face tightened with defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just two or three months ago, she'd dismissed Marcus as an insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he'd grown to this level and didn't even see her as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His meteoric rise made her realize he wasn't exaggerating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before coming to Solomia, she'd thought her breakthrough to Level Nine Demon Fighter would guarantee victory over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she remained an ant in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His growth outpaced hers by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the gap was widening with no hope of closing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger and Marcus were siblings. They were vying for Ryan's legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A showdown was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the low-profile Bruce was lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They formed a tense three-way standoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A year ago, such a scenario was unthinkable. Marcus had been a useless son-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been scorned by the Winchesters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Bruce nor Roger had considered him a contender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet within a year, he had risen so high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, killing him required their intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they couldn't do it because of blood ties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ryan was annoyed, none of them could live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That explained why Roger sent assassins after Marcus but never faced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison dressed herself, applying light makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She transformed back into an ethereal figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost hard to believe she had just been pinned beneath Marcus, moaning in abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he felt the stark contrast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you staring at?" she asked, a hint of fear in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dreaded another assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing," Marcus replied curtly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I go now?" Alison sought his permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that she couldn't escape without his consent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure. But next time, don't come throwing yourself at me. If you do, I'll launch another round," Marcus said, his eyes roving over her body unabashedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clothed and primped, she exuded even greater allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured. Next time I come for you, I'll be fully prepared to take your life," Alison vowed, glaring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paid her threats no mind. He slipped back to Chloe's home in Sunridge Estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe slept soundly, exhausted from the previous night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't wake up until 10 a.m. the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a lunch planned with Eulalia's family, she sprang up to get ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an A-list star, Chloe excelled at makeup and styling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just an hour, she emerged youthful and radiant</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beauty was striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alone, she was lovely. Among a crowd, she'd stand out like a peacock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, let's head out," Chloe chirped, throwing herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fragrance enveloped him, stirring his urges anew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to pin her down there and then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his hardness, Chloe paled, pulling away in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Why are you hard again?" she muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned, "Because you're too irresistible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed, memories of last night's passion flickering through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're terrible. We're running out of time. You can't do that now," she said, slipping on her shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, and they left together, taking the elevator down to the car and driving to the agreed-upon restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a restaurant famous in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its casual label, the place was grand, five stories tall with lavish decor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at midday, it buzzed with diners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rode the elevator to the third floor, entering Room 308.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Eulalia and Isolde awaited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting beside them was a bespectacled, balding man in his early thirties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia stood up to greet them. "Chloe, you're finally here. Isolde and I have been waiting for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, let me introduce you. This is Thorne Winslow, sales manager at SiliconWave Technologies in Kingston. He earns ten million dollars a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mentioned him on the phone yesterday. He's a Kingston native, a PhD from a famous university, with a solid family background. He is Isolde's classmate, still single, so I thought I'd set you two up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She introduced Chloe to that bald man wearing glasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe nodded politely at Thorne, then sat with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne sized up Marcus with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isolde, when did you get back?" Chloe asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde was Eulalia's only daughter. She had been thriving abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She served as the deputy general manager at a branch of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, with an annual salary equivalent to around ten million Uswadian coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a bona fide senior white-collar elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got back the day before yesterday. I'm on a month-and-a-half annual leave from the company. It's boring overseas, so I came to see my mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And maybe play matchmaker for you," Isolde replied, sizing Marcus up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His unfamiliar face and youthful age drew a faint sneer from her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
