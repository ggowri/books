  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Freya acting shamelessly, Jade frowned deeply. "Freya, how can you be so untrustworthy? We had an agreement, yet here you are, going back on your word. I've never met anyone as brazen as you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before Jade could say another word, Jayden shouted at her, "Freya is right! Even though you succeeded in the surgery, we suspect you were guided by someone else, which counts as cheating. Even if the surgery was a success, it's not your achievement. So whether you resign or not, I must fire you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Jayden pulled out a pen and paper from his pocket, quickly scribbled something down, and stamped it with his seal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an official termination letter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, you're fired. Go settle your paycheck with accounting and leave the hospital immediately. Solomia Hospital will no longer welcome you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden handed the termination letter to Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face was full of unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had clearly succeeded in the surgery, yet she was being fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden and Freya were clearly working together, and she couldn't fight them on her own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other doctors and nurses watching showed schadenfreude on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the beginning, they had known Jade was no match for Freya.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Jayden backing her, Freya was sure to win, and Jade was bound to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just a department head. What authority do you have to fire a department doctor? If I'm not mistaken, firing a doctor requires Mr. Lake's signature!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Jade was sinking into despair, Marcus' voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden and Freya's faces both showed mockery as Freya sneered at Marcus, "Who do you think you are to question Jayden's orders?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me tell you the truth&mdash;Jayden is a highly-paid expert brought in by Solomia Hospital. He was appointed department head as soon as he joined. His authority is beyond your questioning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Freya's words, Jayden's face showed a trace of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had lost to Robert back in the day, Jayden had still achieved considerable success in the field of surgery thanks to his years of clinical experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dealing with someone as young as Jade was an easy task for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh? A highly-paid expert? Does he have more authority than Mr. Lake?" Marcus said with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya shot Marcus a fierce glare. "You talk as if you can actually get Mr. Lake to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, Marcus was just a loudmouth. His earlier prediction of Jade's surgical success was probably just a lucky guess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Jayden backing her, she was untouchable today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden also glanced at Marcus with contempt, his expression full of provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you're saying that, I guess I have no choice but to call Mr. Lake," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus paid no attention to Freya's mocking remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled out his phone and made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The call lasted less than a minute before Marcus ended it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya and Jayden's faces were full of disdain, convinced that Marcus was just bluffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could someone so young know Carter, let alone summon him with just one phone call?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other doctors and nurses watching thought the same and were eagerly waiting to see Marcus embarrass himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in less than five minutes, the elevator doors on the operating room floor opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of people hurried out of the elevator, led by a stout man in his sixties&mdash;Carter Lake, the dean of Solomia Hospital himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's expressions shifted to shock at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden and Freya were particularly stunned, their eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe it was just a coincidence, Jayden thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking this, Jayden immediately stepped forward to greet Carter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Carter ignored Jayden completely and walked straight to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of everyone, Carter bowed slightly to Marcus and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, why didn't you let me know you were coming? I would have welcomed you personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene left everyone utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dean of Solomia Hospital was a true heavyweight in the medical field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in all of Uswad, Solomia Hospital ranked among the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was hard to overstate the stature of the dean of such a major general hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet here he was, showing such deference to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just one call, Carter had rushed over and was now bowing respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden and Freya were completely dumbfounded, an ominous feeling rising in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When did your hospital's rules change?" Marcus asked Carter lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter looked momentarily confused before smiling and replying, "Our hospital has been around for nearly a hundred years, and most of the rules have remained unchanged for decades. Mr. Fitzgerald, which rules are you referring to?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
