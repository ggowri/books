  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was taken aback, wondering how Morgana had obtained his phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he asked, "Sure, I've got nothing pressing at home anyway. But I'm really curious. How did you get my phone number? Did Nicole give it to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't think of anyone else besides Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana replied, "No. I did ask Nicole for your phone number, but she said she wanted to protect your privacy and refused to tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her words, Marcus inwardly commended Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She's matured and become far more considerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Protecting my privacy showed real growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then how did you get it?" Marcus persisted, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you remember? When your sister started school, the guardian's contact number on file was yours. I'm her homeroom teacher," Morgana explained, a touch of pride in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was stunned. "Aren't you misusing your position?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana chuckled, "Well, I'm the homeroom teacher. With a meager salary, I've got to have some privileges, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paused briefly before saying, "Alright, I'm just kidding. So, what would you like to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already eaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, he'd decline dinner invitations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Morgana was an exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nicole was on the verge of being carted off by Sebastien and his goons, Morgana had fearlessly stepped in and shielded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For that act of courage and kindness, Marcus felt compelled to have this meal with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite some flaws, her values were sound, and he admired her straightforward sense of right and wrong and her strong moral compass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you free? If so, come to my place. There's a pizzeria downstairs, and their food is really delicious," Morgana suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus agreed, "No problem. Where do you live? Send me the location."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana asked, "How?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Via WhatsApp," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana complained, "I messaged you before, but you never replied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a twinge of awkwardness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled over and retrieved his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he said to Morgana, "Send it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly, a new message arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus opened it and saw that the sender's nickname was "Princess Morgana".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it must be Morgana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sent a cute emoji, followed by the location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus checked the location and found that Morgana lived in an old part of town, in an aging residential area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was well-equipped, bustling with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pizzeria, likely open for two or three decades, was a local institution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drove to the pizzeria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than 15 minutes, he arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering, he spotted Morgana by the window, waving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd changed into a light beige dress that complemented her beauty, making her stand out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you to be so quick," Morgana exclaimed, a smile spreading across her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In casual wear, Morgana had shed the teacher's sternness, revealing a youthful, girlish charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought it made sense. After all, she looked around 24 or 25.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still young, perhaps fresh out of university.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as a teacher, she had to project authority. Otherwise, students wouldn't listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my sister's teacher. I had to hurry. Otherwise, what if you give her a hard time?" Marcus joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana glared at Marcus and asked, "Do I seem that small-minded?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, what would you like to eat? Their pizza is delicious. The place isn't fancy, but you'll be hooked after one bite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana spoke highly of the pizzeria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already caught the pizza's rich aroma upon entering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're familiar with this place. Order whatever you like. I'm sure I'll love it, too," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Morgana didn't hold back and immediately started scribbling on the menu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a waiter brought out a lot of clean and appetizing food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana and Marcus began to dig in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the meal, they chatted about many things. He learned about Nicole's school life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since starting university, she had matured, becoming a class leader with solid grades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her encounter with Sebastien at the pub was part of a pre-holiday class gathering. After dinner, they went there to have fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the conversation, Marcus realized Morgana wasn't as serious as she'd seemed. She was lively and full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, her pretense was a professional requirement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a teacher, Morgana had to project an aura of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in her personal life, she was almost no different from an ordinary young woman of twenty-four or twenty-five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just after they finished eating, a pained expression crossed Morgana's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched her stomach, her complexion turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana waved her hand and replied, "It seems to be a stomach ache. I probably ate something too spicy just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly fetched a cup of warm water for her and asked her to drink it slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her stomach ache didn't ease at all. Instead, it became more severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "You're in bad shape. I'll take you home right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had planned to visit a coffee shop and sit for a while, but given Morgana's condition, they couldn't go anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded slightly and cast an apologetic glance at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Marcus helped Morgana and entered the residential complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, the restaurant they had chosen was very close to her home. Otherwise, it would have been troublesome for her to get home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her place was on the sixth floor of a walk-up building, so going upstairs was very tiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was now sweating profusely from the pain, showing symptoms of a stomach spasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her current state, climbing the stairs was a daunting task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without asking for Morgana's permission, Marcus directly carried her on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a startled yelp and asked, "Marcus, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the warmth from his back, she was embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time she had been in such close contact with a strange man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was no longer considered close contact, but zero-distance contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carrying you upstairs. What else?" Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Morgana could say anything more, he started climbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she felt his body temperature, her heart raced, and a sense of warmth filled her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana had been working in this strange city for several years. Besides a few female friends, she had never received such care from a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some men were only interested in her beauty and had ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Morgana could tell that Marcus was different from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He genuinely wanted to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus soon reached the sixth-floor apartment and gently placed Morgana on the sofa...</span></p><div class="pagination">
