"Vincent, are you awake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to look at Janet and Josie, who were still a little weak. "Janet, Josie, am I in the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you are in the hospital. You have a heart attack, and the doctor says that rescue is ineffective..." Janet excitedly held his hand, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, several doctors in the ward also witnessed this magical scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A doctor said, "The patient actually woke up. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several doctors rushed forward and performed various examinations on Vincent. "Sir, are you still feeling uncomfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that all the indicators displayed on the monitoring equipment had returned to normal, several doctors felt like they were dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hospital had the most advanced cardiology treatment methods in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still nothing they could do for patients like Vincent, who suffered from aortic congestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>he </span><span>just </span><span>miraculously woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through instrument detection, the blockage of the heart's aorta was found to have completely disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent said, "No, I feel refreshed, my heart beats stronger, and my breathing is smoother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Janet and Josie were overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, not only does Vincent not have to die, his heart disease had also been completely cured," Josie screamed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew his illness very well, so she had been taking expensive medicine to maintain his health for the past few years. However, Vincent was already in a terminal state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now everything had change!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie couldn't help but think of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Vincent's recovery had something to do with Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she gave up the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked to be in his early twenties and didn't look like someone who knew medicine at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he did not treat Vincent but just held his hand for a few minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could believe that this matter had anything to do with Marcus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a miracle! The patient who was declared dead due to aortic infarction came back to life. It's incredible," Vincent's attending physician spoke with a look of disbelief on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been practicing medicine for decades, and such a miraculous thing had never happened before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know my condition better than anyone. If it wasn't for that young man who saved me, I'd have been dead already," Vincent suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left everyone stunned. Josie frowned, "Vincent, that's impossible. You've been confined to your ward this whole time, with no outside contact. What young man are you talking about? Are you sure you weren't dreaming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent </span><span>replied</span><span>, "I'm not dreaming. The young man was holding my hand just now. He used a magical method to help me clear the blockage in my heart and left not long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, he is my savior, and you must thank him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Josie was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't Marcus the young man who just held Vincent's hand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Josie but also the doctor, who had just driven Marcus away, reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was disbelief in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor hurried forward to ask, "Sir, you can't say such nonsense. Is the young man you are talking about really that amazing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent frowned, "Although I was seriously ill, I was still conscious. I just couldn't speak or control my body. It was that young man who saved me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If what he said was true, then Marcus's insistence on holding Vincent's hand was to cure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As modern doctors, they only believed in high-tech equipment, advanced drugs, and treatments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never heard of this kind of treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of method was that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, the young man you're talking about is called Marcus, who is a new client of mine. He just left, and he shouldn't have gone far," Josie said to Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get him back here right now," Vincent exclaimed, his eyes lighting up. "I need to thank </span><span>him</span><span> myself."</span></p><div class="pagination">
