  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya didn't hold back at all, shouting loudly right outside the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she pointed a finger toward Marcus, her eyes filled with derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aniya, are you seriously going to act like this?" Darian was fuming. "Mr. Fitzgerald is a complete stranger to me. Not only did he not demand compensation for the car accident, but he also just saved Cal's life. That's more than anyone could ever expect. How can you ask him to make me a millionaire?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's words hit with the weight of years of frustration. He had been tortured by Aniya's sharp tongue for as long as he could remember. There were days he felt trapped, unable to voice his anger, suffering in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, Darian's right," Kiera added, stepping out of the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze toward Marcus was filled with gratitude. "Mr. Fitzgerald has done so much for us. You can't just dismiss his help like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Marcus spoke up, his tone calm but pointed. "You mentioned Jaxon Rollins, right? The son of Director Rollins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya was quick to respond, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Yes, Jaxon Rollins. Why, do you know him? You're trying to buddy up to him, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her mind, Director Rollins' son was the perfect match for her daughter&mdash;no one else could compare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch. "Jaxon Rollins, huh? According to what you've said, he got his position as the manager at Golden Group through connections."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's hands were on her hips, clearly agitated. "So what if he did? Everyone does what they have to do. You're just jealous, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded, his voice steady. "Actually, I don't mind people using their connections. But the thing is, Golden Group has strict rules. You can't just get in if you don't meet their qualifications. And Jaxon didn't. So, he's going to have to be let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words hung in the air as Marcus pulled out his phone and dialed. He didn't look at anyone as he spoke into the receiver, explaining the situation clearly. His tone was firm, and his confidence was unsettling. A few moments later, he hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya couldn't hold back her laughter, mocking Marcus with a sharp edge in her voice. "Oh, really? You think a single phone call from you can get Director Rollins' son fired? Don't tell me you're the CEO of Golden Group." Her mocking tone echoed in the hallway, but Marcus remained unbothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, Ramona, Kiera, and even Sophia were skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They'd heard of Jaxon, and he was well-respected at Golden Group, his career going from strength to strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His father, Director Rollins, had a prestigious position in the city's government. It was hard to imagine someone like him losing his job just because of a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five minutes at most, and you'll see this news on your phone," Marcus said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hah, fine. I'll give you five minutes. If Jaxon isn't fired by then, Ramona and Darian's marriage is over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya crossed her arms in front of her chest, sneering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona, Kiera, and the nurse on duty, Sophia, all looked at Marcus with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They even made a note of the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five minutes later, the room fell into a heavy silence as they all stared at their phones. The first headline they saw on a major news outlet made their jaws drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Golden Group Sales Manager Jaxon Rollins Terminated for Violating Company Regulations &ndash; Official Announcement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The news ticker wasn't front-page material, but it was hard to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The headline was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona, Kiera, Darian, and even Sophia stared at the screen, utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jaxon really got fired? How is that possible? Did he seriously get fired because of a phone call from this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's voice trembled with disbelief, a hint of suspicion creeping into her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a minute, this website must be fake, right? You must have put up a fake news site to trick us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Aniya could finish speaking, Kiera quickly pulled out her phone and opened another news website.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The same news about Jaxon's firing appeared again, but this time it was even the headline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The article listed a series of violations Jaxon had committed during his time as Sales Manager at Golden Group, including embezzling company funds, selling substandard products, and accepting bribes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It also reported that the case had been handed over to the authorities, with the possibility of criminal charges being filed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Aniya was completely stunned, her eyes wide with disbelief as she stared at Marcus. "Who... who are you? How could you have known this would happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't answer Aniya. Instead, he turned his attention to Darian. "I'm guessing you've been in the delivery business for about five or six years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian nodded. "Exactly, five years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus leaned forward slightly, his gaze steady. "What if I gave you some investment money? Do you think you could start your own logistics company?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
