  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why did I feel that way?" Gertie asked, her face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that?" Marcus shot back, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was practically seething with frustration, her teeth clenched. "You know exactly what I'm talking about, but you still act like you don't. What's your game here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not you. How could I possibly know? If you don't want to say it, then forget it," Marcus retorted, clearly uninterested in indulging her further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused instead on channeling more of Timeless Numinous Energy into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's injuries were healing at an obvious, rapid pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the increased flow of energy, she suddenly cried out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was impossible to ignore, almost as if she was reacting to some hidden excitement, an undeniable intensity in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie gasped for air, feeling a rush that quickly built to a point where it was hard to control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled, and she let out more soft moans, as if something had jolted through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why... why are you doing this to me?" she managed to say, her eyes now cold as she looked up at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm healing you," Marcus replied nonchalantly, though he seemed irritated. "If you don't need me anymore, just say it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few more moments passed, and Gertie could feel the last of her wounds closing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't serious enough to leave any lasting damage, and in a few days, she'd be fully recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus withdrew his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timeless Numinous Energy in her body vanished as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pleasant sensation that had filled her body disappeared instantly, leaving her with an unexpected emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like being pulled away from something she didn't want to stop, like a child about to taste candy, only for it to be taken away at the last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt strangely disappointed, as if she'd been left wanting more. But she couldn't bring herself to ask Marcus to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Marcus had already gotten to his feet and was walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, he disappeared into the dense forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching him go, Gertie felt a fleeting urge to call out to him, but she swallowed her words, letting him slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was out of sight, she stomped her foot in frustration, muttering to herself, "He just walks off without a word? Who does he think he is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, completely unaware of her thoughts, had already teleported to Bayside Villa in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he arrived, he saw a familiar figure standing in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slender woman was dressed in a lace nightgown, sitting at a vanity and carefully applying makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Natalia who was putting on makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a startled scream when she noticed movement behind her, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even process what was happening, Marcus had already wrapped his arms around her from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of her perfume hit him like a wave, and in that moment, everything he'd been holding back rushed to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Natalia realize it was Marcus. She turned quickly, her eyes softening as she looked at the man she'd been missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, are you on break?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I'm on winter break. Didn't you get my message about it?" Natalia replied with a playful smile, her eyes twinkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth of Marcus' presence made her cheeks flush, and she found her breath quickening just a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice, that's great," Marcus said, grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her nose a light tap, teasing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia let out a soft giggle, feeling her heart race. There was something about being so close to him that made everything feel so right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Diana and the others?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They just left. I think they're out shopping," Natalia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, okay," Marcus replied, sounding relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shopping was something every woman enjoyed, no matter how powerful they were. Even Diana, with her strength as a Saint Magician, couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was a seasoned pro when it came to finding the best deals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Pearl, who had hardly had the chance to explore Solomia, was eager to see more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all three of them out, there was no chance they'd be back before dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Natalia's beautiful face, Marcus couldn't resist and kissed her gently on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kiss caught her off guard, but it sparked a deep longing in her. Without thinking, she kissed him back, the emotions flooding in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth of her lips, the soft touch, and the familiar scent all made Marcus lose himself for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently laid her back onto the sofa and kissed her more deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... I miss you so much... Do you feel the same?" Natalia gasped, her breath coming in short, uneven bursts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, she couldn't hold back the feelings surging inside her, her breathing growing more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do," Marcus replied, his voice low, his hand reaching toward her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe because she was still young, every time Marcus saw her, he couldn't help but notice how her chest seemed to be growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was even more obvious, fuller, more pronounced, and definitely noticeably larger than before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' touch was light and careless, yet it made Natalia gasp with sharp, breathless cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed her thighs together, moving in a restless rhythm, hoping to ignite the pleasure that came from her most sensitive spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You always lie to me," Natalia gasped, her breath quickening as she eagerly responded to Marcus' kisses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With so many women around you, how could you possibly think about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand moved lower, sliding over her flat stomach, before slipping between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke softly, "Even with all the women around me, it's you I always think about..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers moved with a slow, deliberate rhythm, and she was already wet with anticipation. He could feel the soft flesh tightening around him as he continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he brushed over her most sensitive spot, Natalia's breath caught, and she cried out, her body shuddering as she reached the first wave of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of warmth followed, slicking his fingers as her body reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't resist anymore. He ripped off Natalia's black lace dress, and her full breasts spilled out, now visibly larger than before, almost rivaling Jane's in size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her slender frame, they had an even more striking impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasted no time, his mouth finding her nipple as his tongue teased the sensitive spot, sending waves of sensation through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was completely consumed by desire, her mind going blank in the rush of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus began to remove her underwear, preparing to thrust in, Natalia quickly spoke up, "Marcus, this is the living room. We can't do this here. What if they come back? Let's go to the bedroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned, his tone reassuring. "They're out shopping. They won't be back anytime soon. Don't worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Marcus exerted force with his waist and inserted it directly into Natalia's vagina which had already been wet.</span></p><div class="pagination">
