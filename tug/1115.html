  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rivers' punch glowed with golden light, illuminating the entire cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation was even stronger than an Acquired State Nine expert. Before his Fist Ray descended, Marcus could already feel the terrifying energy contained in this punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt a stinging sensation on his skin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he didn't mind at all. With a casual sidestep, he dodged the punch and began calculating the moves in their battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"First strike!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus dodge easily, Rivers instantly burned with rage, the killing intent in his eyes growing even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "I didn't expect you</span><span> to</span><span> </span><span>react this</span><span> fast, but don't think that you'll survive</span><span> after dodging this</span><span>. Your death is next!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rivers swung his palm, and a golden light formed in his palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The golden light enveloped his body. His form radiated endless energy, like a war god standing tall in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a casual palm strike, a terrifying Hand Strike materialized in the void, like divine punishment descending, pressing down toward Marcus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An incredibly terrifying energy exploded in the void, instantly enveloping the cave in its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the effect of that terrifying energy, Gertie was forced to retreat. She had to release Numinous Energy to resist, yet still felt breathless from the overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus seemed isolated from this space, and no matter how powerful the Hand Strike was, it still couldn't affect him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a deafening roar, the power unleashed by the Hand Strike caused the ground to tremble, and the walls of the cave cracked all around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, such a terrifying Hand Strike still failed to hit Marcus's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Marcus had already appeared in </span><span>a different spot</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood with his hands behind his back, spotless, and looked at Rivers with a face full of mockery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this really </span><span>what you can do</span><span>? You're way too weak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rivers frowned deeply, his eyes filled with killing intent, and said, "I admit I underestimated you before. It seems I must unleash my full strength to kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He began to fully mobilize all his potential, preparing to unleash his strongest strike to completely annihilate Marcus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But your chance is already gone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Rivers could react, he saw Marcus's figure become </span><span>blurred</span><span> at that moment and then </span><span>v</span><span>anish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, Marcus had already appeared right in front of him out of thin air!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rivers was terrified and instinctively launched an attack, trying to force Marcus back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus didn&rsquo;t give him any chance! He suddenly reached out </span><span>one</span><span> hand and directly grabbed one of Rivers' snake heads!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, a terrifying Devouring Power erupted, instantly enveloping Rivers' body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rivers looked horrified, desperately trying to break free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he found that his body no longer obeyed him, as if bound by some kind of force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, he felt the energy within him rapidly draining away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rivers trembled uncontrollably, his eyes filled with terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible? How can this be? How can you unleash such terrifying Devouring Power? What kind of evil sorcery are you practicing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He struggled frantically, using all his strength to unleash his full potential in an attempt to resist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying shockwaves echoed continuously, the entire space consumed by destructive force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, to Marcus, these forces were nothing more than child's play.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll never have the chance to know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A mocking smile curled at the corner of his mouth, then he intensified the Devouring Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rivers stared at Marcus in horror. The golden glow around him gradually dimmed at this moment. His face was deathly pale!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the Devouring Power intensified, Rivers</span><span> stopped his struggles</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
