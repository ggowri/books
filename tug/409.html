  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the Curse Weavers tried to use curses to drive Marcus back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus wasn't having any of it. His golden scimitar sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blade cut through the sky like a bolt of lightning, decapitating the Curse Weaver in an instant. Blood gushed out in a wild spray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second Curse Weaver froze in shock, his heart racing as panic set in. He turned to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't even hesitate. He stepped forward, unleashing a powerful punch crackling with Thunderfire Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The punch tore through the space between them, landing in front of the Curse Weaver before he could blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Desperately, the Curse Weaver threw up a magical shield to block the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he was no match for Marcus. With one crushing blow, Marcus shattered the bones in his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Curse Weaver screamed, a howl of agony, before releasing a cloud of pink powder into the air, hoping to force Marcus back with its deadly toxins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus was faster&mdash;much faster than he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the Curse Weaver stumbled backward, Marcus' scimitar flashed through the air with the speed of a lightning strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blade's glow was blinding as it slashed down toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Curse Weaver screamed, but it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blade crashed down from above, slicing through him and splitting his body in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of the Curse Weavers watched in stunned silence, their faces drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them stammered in terror, "His power... he's reached the Fifth Stage of Ancient Martial Arts! We can't defeat him. We need to retreat and call for help from the High Priest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the words left his mouth, the remaining two Curse Weavers pulled out a crimson orb from their robes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hurled the orb to the ground with all their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The orb exploded, releasing a thick cloud of white mist that rapidly enveloped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the mist dissipated, they had vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't fully understand the energies these Curse Weavers wielded, nor what they had just used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he was certain the red orb had something to do with spatial magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It meant they hadn't gone far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus immediately unleashed his spiritual powers, expanding them to cover the area around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since his advancement to the Fifth Stage of Ancient Martial Arts, his spiritual powers have grown considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had devoted a lot of effort to mastering his spiritual powers, making them stronger than most at his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the two Curse Weavers could get far, his senses locked onto their exact location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were inside the cliffside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was surprised. The cliff seemed to have no entrance, and he had no idea how they had managed to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be some kind of illusion rune?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus suddenly had an idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered how, during his battle with Asher Dupont, his opponent had used a rune formation to disguise a mountain pass by the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To the outside world, it had appeared to be an ordinary pass, but in reality, it had been an altered space, concealed by an illusion rune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this realization, Marcus wasted no time and began scanning his Heavenly Circle Diagram for any illusion runes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly tried applying the techniques recorded in the diagram to unravel the illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As expected, what seemed like an ordinary cliff was actually a cleverly disguised illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, the cliff hid an entirely different world within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus quickly pinpointed the method to break the illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He muttered the incantation softly, following the steps outlined in the diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within moments, the surface of the cliff glowed faintly, and a door appeared, opening with incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A rush of spatial energy spilled out from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus stepped through. And inside... it was like another world entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air hit him like a punch&mdash;a thick, oppressive, blood-laden atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The space was enormous, easily thousands of square meters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The floor was littered with severed limbs, and blood ran in rivers, stinking of decay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prisoners were locked in iron cages, tortured and twisted beyond recognition, their eyes wide with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two Curse Weavers who had fled earlier were here, along with several others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Curse Weavers were hungrily tearing into freshly severed limbs, their faces twisted with twisted pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood dripped from their mouths as they feasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them was a white-haired man, dressed in strange, ornate robes&mdash;a figure who could only be the High Priest the Curse Weavers had spoken of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon seeing Marcus enter, they immediately stopped their gruesome feast, turning to look at him with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, how the hell did you find this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two Curse Weavers who had fought Marcus earlier asked, clearly caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't get to ask questions. That blood curse? It was probably set up by your so-called High Priest. And today... I'm going to take his blood to save Yvonne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes burned with intensity as he ground out each word between clenched teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two Curse Weavers sneered, their expressions dripping with condescension. "Kid, you're living in a fantasy. You've come this far, but do you really think you're walking out of here alive? In your dreams!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
