  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered and said, &ldquo;Do I need a treasure to withstand your attack? You&rsquo;re overestimating yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too arrogant!&rdquo; Minerva immediately felt humiliated by Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let out a roar and unleashed another Hand Strike, slamming it fiercely onto Marcus&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the result was the same as last time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Minerva's attack was stronger this time, she still couldn&rsquo;t shake Marcus&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus&rsquo;s body released a powerful recoil, forcing Minerva to step back a few paces as a surge of hot blood churned within her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This..." Minerva's face looked terrible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn&rsquo;t help but take a deep look at Marcus and gritted her teeth, saying, &ldquo;Very well. I was curious before about why you dared to be so arrogant in front of me. Turns out, you&rsquo;ve mastered some kind of powerful treasure.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, don&rsquo;t think this treasure can protect you forever. I want to see how long you can last."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Minerva took out a pill from her Spatial Ring and swallowed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, her energy surged, becoming even more powerful than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus knew this was a pill that could stimulate human potential in a short time, mobilizing all the user's potential and temporarily boosting their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To kill Marcus, Minerva didn&rsquo;t hesitate to use such a pill, showing how intense her hatred for Marcus was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Minerva, stop it. If you keep this up, you'll definitely suffer." Seeing Minerva about to attack Marcus again, Gertie quickly stepped forward to stop her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out of the way!" Minerva shoved Gertie aside and unleashed an even more terrifying attack, wildly striking toward Marcus's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of her strike was clearly stronger than before; wherever it passed, the void trembled as if everything was about to be destroyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in the face of Minerva's terrifying attack, Marcus remained completely calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply stood there calmly, looking at Minerva as if she were nothing more than an ant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Minerva's attack landed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she felt like she had struck not a person, but an unbreakable wall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how powerful her attack was, she couldn't shake this wall at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re still not dead. In that case, I&rsquo;ll have to use a weapon," Minerva said coldly, then prepared to draw her weapon to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus calmly said, "I&rsquo;ve already given you three chances, but you still couldn&rsquo;t shake my body. Now, it&rsquo;s my turn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Minerva could act, Marcus moved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached out his large hand and grabbed forward directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His large hand, containing the power to destroy everything, grabbed Minerva's throat in no time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva was slightly surprised, looking at Marcus in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She desperately launched attacks, trying to push Marcus back, but it was impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus's body remained as solid as a wall, and her attacks meant nothing to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Marcus's large hand gripping her throat tightened even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Minerva's face turned red. Her breathing became labored at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With such little strength, you dare show off in front of me?" Marcus said as he directly lifted Minerva's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense constriction left Minerva unable to breathe for a short time, on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you? Why is your strength so overwhelming?" Minerva asked, staring at Marcus in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she actually felt a threat of death emanating from Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have no right to know," Marcus said coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected Minerva to be such a stubborn woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gertie grabbed Marcus's sleeve, her eyes red as she pleaded, "Marcus, please don't hold it against Minerva. She's just too emotional. Please don't hurt her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was raised by Minerva, so naturally, she didn't want to see Marcus kill Minerva just like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus actually didn't want to kill Minerva. After all, she was Gertie's aunt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie was his woman. How could he possibly kill her relative?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Gertie plead, Marcus loosened his large hand and then tossed Minerva's body aside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva kept taking deep breaths, feeling like her life was almost taken away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Marcus, her gaze still icy cold. Then, gritting her teeth, she said, "No matter who you are, you dared to harm the Leah family. This isn't over. You must give the Leah family an explanation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying that, Minerva took out something resembling a flare from the Spatial Ring and detonated it right in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the flare shot into the sky and exploded into a brilliant flower in the void. Immediately, everyone in the Leah family saw it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
