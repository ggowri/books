  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't care about her threats. With a swift kick, he knocked her to the ground, his gaze cold as he said, "Remember, not everyone can be bullied like that. If you don't pay up, this is the lightest punishment I'm giving you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked over to Chad, who was still stunned, and patted him on the shoulder. "Come on. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad snapped out of it and quickly followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus led Chad to the Aston Martin parked in the alley, pressed the unlock button, and as the headlights flashed on, Chad's eyes nearly popped out of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, when did you get so rich? Wait, this has to be a rental, right? Or are you driving this for someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad rubbed his eyes, not believing what he was seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Marcus had always been the poorest kid in their class back in school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had only been a few years, and now he couldn't wrap his head around how Marcus had suddenly come into so much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Chad was jealous. It just felt like a dream come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, come on. You're acting like this car costs a fortune. It's only worth five or six million. And you seriously think I'd rent it? Can't you think better of me?" Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five or six million... only?" Chad swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you really are rich now. Your whole vibe's changed. Do you know how much five or six million is? I'd probably have to deliver food my whole life just to make that much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned. "Well, if you stop delivering food, you could work with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad raised an eyebrow. "Sure, but can you at least let me drive a car like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you want? You'd be satisfied with just a five or six million car? If you really want it, I'll give it to you," Marcus said, tossing him the car keys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad caught the keys, his heart racing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Marcus had both dreamed of owning a supercar when they were younger, but reality had crushed those dreams as they got older.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hop in. Let's grab a drink somewhere. You drive," Marcus said, noticing the gleam of admiration in Chad's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad didn't hesitate. He slid into the driver's seat, started the car after a couple of tries, and with a tap of the accelerator, the V8 engine roared to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now this is what I'm talking about! The engine sounds amazing!" Chad grinned, his face lighting up. He looked more alive than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop admiring it and drive already," Marcus reminded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad quickly shifted into gear and hit the gas, the car smoothly rolling down the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the improved traffic, the roads weren't as packed as usual, and Chad, who had some experience with a professional driving service, quickly adapted to the Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the woman slowly got to her feet, wincing as pain shot through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but dial her boyfriend Jacob Perry's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob was the project manager at Bayside Petroleum Company, a position he'd held for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, he had built up an impressive network of connections, both within the company and in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the company's lax management, he had embezzled a substantial amount of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with a salary of over two million a year, Jacob had accumulated a fortune worth over 100 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman wasn't his wife but his mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wife couldn't have children, but this woman had given him a son, which made Jacob dote on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he heard about her being beaten, Jacob flew into a rage and immediately headed to the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her car wrecked and her badly injured, he immediately called the head of Bayside Petroleum Company's security team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was called a security team, in reality, they were just a group of thugs hired by Lonnie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the same people who had confronted Marcus when Joan clashed with him the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the Jenkins couple's deaths, Bayside Petroleum Company had been fully acquired by Death, and operations continued smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leadership remained the same, but the company had no more ties to the Jenkins family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even though the Jenkins couple was dead, the company was simply cooperating with the police investigation, and it didn't affect their other business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving Jacob's call, the head of the security team immediately agreed to send people to track down Marcus and Chad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no idea any of this was happening. At that moment, he and Chad had already reached a restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ordered some food and a few bottles of beer, ready to unwind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After not seeing each other for so long, the two drank, laughed, and caught up, reminiscing about the old days.</span></p><div class="pagination">
