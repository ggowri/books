Mr. Fitzgerald... please don't, there are too many people here, it's too embarrassing to be seen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon panted, reminding Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feared Marcus might take things too far right here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sensation was indeed too wonderful, causing a constant struggle between desire and reason in Shannon's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each side took turns gaining the upper hand, complicating Shannon's thoughts further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let me take you to a place where we're alone," Marcus whispered as he kissed Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where?" Shannon asked urgently. There was a hint of anticipation in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she felt her relationship with Marcus was progressing too quickly, She truly couldn't withstand Marcus' advances and could only let him have his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll see when we get there," Marcus said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he took out a yellowed piece of paper from his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The front of the paper was adorned with intricate and ancient totems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the "Celestial Illusion Formation" diagram obtained from the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the name suggests, it's an illusion rune. Activating the diagram would transport everything within the Celestial Illusion Formation into another space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus chanted, the "Celestial Illusion Formation" diagram began to glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a surge of spatial power quickly blossomed, swiftly enveloping Marcus and Shannon's bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this magical scene, Shannon's eyes widened in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could react, everything before her eyes turned ethereal, and soon, when things solidified again, she found herself in another world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no one here, only plants, trees, and a babbling brook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, the green mountains were layered, endless, and shrouded in white mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, where is this place? Weren't we at school? How did we suddenly get here?" Shannon asked Marcus, her eyes wide with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to worry about that. Let's continue what we were doing," Marcus said, his lower abdomen still burning with desire, and he did not want to waste time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Shannon could speak, Marcus kissed her directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon, whose mouth was blocked, immediately felt aroused, her breathing becoming rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to the atmosphere, Shannon no longer cared at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She began to respond desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, her panting became more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, do you want me?" Shannon asked, her voice full of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, his hands directly climbing to Shannon's prominent breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon gasped as Marcus didn't give her time to react and tore her dress to shreds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Shannon wearing only a black lace lingerie set!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It created a strong visual impact against her wheat-colored skin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Shannon's skin wasn't traditionally tender, her touch was smooth and delicate, like a baby's skin, incredibly silky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon subconsciously hugged her ample breasts, her eyes full of shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hands, through Shannon's black lace bra, finally touched her firm breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her nipples were already erect, and with any casual touch from Marcus, Shannon could emit an enticing moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sound was incredibly tempting to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could no longer bear it and directly pulled down the black lace bra!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon's large breasts sprang free, not only huge in size but also quite firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her skin was wheat-colored, Shannon's areolas were still tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but take one into his mouth, sucking vigorously!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm... Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon couldn't bear this kind of stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body kept moving, and her mysterious cleft also became wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand delved under her skirt, touching the already wet cleft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... Is this your revenge?" Shannon asked with a blushing face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's only the beginning," Marcus said as he pulled down Shannon's panties.</span></p><div class="pagination">
