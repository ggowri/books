  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&hellip;" Kiera trembled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was willing to endure Helen's unreasonableness, her insults and slander, and even being forced to move out without cause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But being accused of promiscuity and prostitution was a humiliation she could not tolerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Am I wrong? Didn't you say you were single? Then who's that man in your room?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not fooling around with some random guy, then what are you doing? You look all prim and proper on the outside, but deep down, you're nothing but a slut!" Helen shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grew more aggressive, her words becoming increasingly vicious. Seeing that she had the upper hand, she refused to let up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's this rabid dog barking here?" Marcus said sternly, stepping out of the room with a cold expression as he fixed his gaze on Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen looked him up and down and then sneered, "Oh, the random guy himself. What, you paid for a prostitute and actually caught feelings? This is between me and that whore&mdash;what makes you think you have a say in it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And just who do you think you are? Look at you&mdash;nothing but some dirt-poor hick. You probably make peanuts working some dead-end job, and you still have money to waste on prostitutes? Do your parents know you're throwing their hard-earned cash away like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say that again?" Marcus demanded. His brows furrowed, and a chilling aura began to radiate from him as Helen's words became increasingly offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Helen, oblivious to the shift in atmosphere, continued her taunts. "Oh? And what if I do? What can you do about it? A loser like you, standing up for this cheap slut? Please, take a good look at yourself. I&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Marcus's hand shot out. A loud slap landed squarely on her face, sending her sprawling to the ground with a wretched cry of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plump face swelled up instantly, turning a nasty shade of purple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from her mouth, and one of her molars had been knocked loose, leaving her looking utterly pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&hellip; you actually dared to hit me? Do you even know who my husband is? You're dead! I swear, I'm going to make you pay for this!" Helen screamed, sitting on the ground and wailing, her voice shrill. "Help! This damn hick hit me! Neighbors, come quick! He's trying to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be said&mdash;she wasn't just fat; she had a ridiculously loud voice too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cries echoed through the building, and soon, neighbors began stepping out of their apartments to see what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helen, what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helen, don't cry. We've all been neighbors for years&mdash;we won't just stand by and do nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two burly men spoke up, their concern apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen replied, tears streaming down her face, "I told this tramp to move out, but she refused. Not only that, but she's been engaging in prostitution in my apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that random man in there? He's her client. With him backing her up, she's gotten even bolder. She beat me up and even threatened to kill me. You all have to stand up for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was one of aggrieved innocence as she twisted the truth to paint herself as the victim, while placing all the blame on Marcus and Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young lady, how could you do something like this? You always seemed so quiet and well-behaved, but now this? Aren't you ashamed? Bringing random men into your place?" someone said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you even let him hit Helen? Let me tell you, we won't stand by and let you and your man run wild here!" another echoed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
