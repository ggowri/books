  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... how is it possible that you have the Supreme Token of the Bloodthirsty Cult?" Victor stared at Marcus in horror. "What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you see for yourself?" Marcus replied with a cold smile. His spiritual powers flared to life, sending golden streams of spiritual sense directly into Victor's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, new memories flooded Victor's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vision played out like a movie in his thoughts, showing Marcus defeating the head of the Bloodthirsty Cult and the entire congregation bowing before him in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vision faded, Victor's expression transformed from disbelief to absolute terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's legs gave out, and he crashed to the floor. His trembling finger pointed at Marcus as he stammered, "This can't be real. How could you possibly... How could someone like you have this kind of status? It has to be an illusion. You're tricking me with some kind of illusion magic. None of this can be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe someone as young as Marcus possessed such overwhelming power. It seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cult leader was a Peak Level Eight Curse Weaver&mdash;practically a god in Victor's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No ordinary person could stand against that kind of power, let alone someone as young as Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Victor could process another thought, the air around Marcus shifted. An intense coercion radiated from his body, invisible to the regular people in the banquet hall. To them, everything looked perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Victor felt like a mountain had dropped on his shoulders. The pressure slammed him face-first into the floor, and his bones creaked in protest. Under this terrifying coercion, he felt like his body might shatter at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're an Ancient Martial Stage Nine," he choked out, terror written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had created a barrier around them, making their conversation private from the other guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still think I'm using illusions to trick you?" Marcus asked coolly, looking down at Victor with his hands clasped behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat soaked through Victor's clothes as he groveled. "No, never again! I'd never dare doubt you again! I had no idea someone of your power was here. Please, please forgive my disrespect. Spare my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor struggled to his feet, only to drop back down and start repeatedly bowing his head to Marcus, each bow making a distinct thud against the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though no one could make out what they were saying, Victor's actions were crystal clear to everyone watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire room froze, staring in disbelief at the scene unfolding before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This couldn't be happening. It just couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor wasn't just anybody&mdash;he was Ross' teacher, the legendary Curse Weaver of </span><span>Southvaia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the same man who'd casually taken out an armed guard with a single curse magic earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power was off the charts, way beyond what any normal person could even dream of matching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here he was, after just a brief conversation with Marcus, looking absolutely terrified and kneeling like a servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left everyone completely stunned. Ross especially couldn't process what he was seeing. In his mind, Victor had always been this unstoppable force&mdash;even his grandfather couldn't stop singing praises about Victor's curse magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was this untouchable figure, on his knees, kneeling to some guy like his life depended on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross had to blink several times, convinced he was hallucinating. If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he would've laughed if someone had told him this was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. </span><span>Drakov</span><span>, what are you doing?" Ross blurted out, his voice cracking with panic. "Why are you kneeling to this nobody? He's just some small-time media company boss from </span><span>Solomia</span><span>! He's nothing compared to Royal Entertainment. He's not even worth our time! There has to be some mistake, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else&mdash;Lila, Chloe, Lucy, and all the other social media celebrities&mdash;stared in stunned silence, their minds racing to make sense of what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross had barely finished speaking when Victor shot up from his seat, his face cold with fury as he shouted at him. The sudden outburst sent another wave of shock through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody had forgotten Victor's intimidating entrance earlier&mdash;he'd shown up specifically to back Ross up. But now, in a complete 180, he was straight-up yelling at him. Even Ross looked totally puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all the years Ross had known his mentor, Victor had always been patient and kind with him. He'd never seen him act like this before. And it was all because of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unfairness of it made Ross' blood boil. "Mr. </span><span>Drakov</span><span>," he growled through </span><span>clenched teeth, "what kind of spell did this guy put on you? How did he manage to turn you against me like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto the token in Victor's hand. "Is it because of that worthless piece of metal? What's so special about it that you're treating it like some kind of sacred relic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain his rage any longer, Ross snatched the Supreme Token from Victor's hand. He slammed it onto the ground and ground it under his heel before spitting on it for good measure, his face twisted with bitter contempt.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
