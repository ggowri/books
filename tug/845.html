  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took out his cell phone and made two calls in a row to the president of Sync Group and the president of Eastcomm Group to let them cancel the cooperation with Molly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he made two phone calls, it took him a while to get things done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he finally hung up the phone, Molly's patience had already been worn out. She said, "You take all this time just to brag. Do you think your acting skills are really good enough to make us believe that you know both the bosses of those business giants? You talk to them like you're their employer. Don't treat us as fools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly's analysis made many people suddenly realize how ridiculous it was, and they all thought that she was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way a twenty-year-old would hire those entrepreneurs. Even thinking about something like that would be ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Molly, just apologize to Marcus. I'm telling you the truth. He owns these two companies. I didn't tell you that because I didn't want you to feel that I intended to show off. He actually owns many other companies. You have totally underestimated him," Josie couldn't help but persuade her bestie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't just watch Marcus ruin her best friend's family income just for a bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Molly burst into mockery and said to Josie, "Josie, did you hear what you said? It's even more absurd for you to be his accomplice! So, you mean he owns the Sync Group, Eastcomm Group, and other companies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a distorted laugh on her face, she didn't even bother talking but chose a harsh laugh to mock Josie and Marcus to the extent of even losing her breath for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had she expected that her best friend had turned out to be a woman lying for the sake of vanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah also said with ridicule, "If he's really so good as you said, does he know the boss of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>McHale Pharmaceuticals Group was a large multinational pharmaceutical company with a global reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, no enterprise in Uswad could be compared with it for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this premise, Hannah said that with sharp mockery as she was completely sure that Marcus could never be able to have any bearings on such a superior group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Josie had witnessed so many miracles Marcus had made and was one hundred percent confident with this young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, after Hannah said those mocking words, she remained silent and turned to Marcus for his opinions with her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied with a smile, "You're right. I do know someone who works for the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all the people in this very box were stunned, including the three people in direct conflict with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many even doubted whether they were hallucinating in their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they all had one thought: this arrogant yet ignorant young man simply lost his mind to blurt out that nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even exclaimed his superior skill of telling a lie without any trace of guilt or nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah figured out the most possible scenario and said to Marcus, "Oh, I see. You mean you know a random office worker of the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group who is facing the risk of being sacked any time. That's not the same thing we are talking about. It must be like this. You are playing word games with me, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus said with self-composure, "It's not polite to reveal the role the person I know plays in this company. You just need to understand that I can make your husband lose his job with a single phone call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shocking haughtiness made people present gasp in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he said was simply impossible to them because Hannah's husband was the vice president of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group's branch in Uswad with great power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an important man in this company couldn't be fired just because of this nobody's phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excessive rage led Hannah to burst into laughter. She glared at Marcus in confusion and mockery. "I'm also curious about how you're gonna do that. Show us, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing that, people around also started mocking Marcus and looked at him like a retard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately cast weird eyes on her and said, "You're the first person who intends to make her husband lose his job. Interesting. Well, it's all for your strong request, madam."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, he took out his name card holder and took out Cecilia's business card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia was the heiress of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group and the absolute core of this business empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, she came to Solomia for business and suffered a congenital heart attack on the roadside and almost died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was the very man who saved her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Cecilia was extremely grateful to her savior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, after witnessing Marcus' proficient medical skills, she would also like to make friends with this young man who had the ability to bring the dead back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she had established a good friendship with him, she could ask him to cure important people, such as her family or friend, if they were inflicted with some incurable diseases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money would be too powerless to maintain this kind of relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heiress to the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, Cecilia knew it very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to her gratitude towards Marcus, she also embraced admiration and respect for him. Also, she wanted to get close to him as much as she could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving Marcus' call, Cecilia was surprised and joyful. She asked in a very respectful tone, "Mr. Fitzgerald, just tell me what you want. I'll try my best to assist you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't beat the bush and asked her to fire Hannah's husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing that, Cecilia, to his surprise, agreed without hesitation. "In fact, I have been thinking about the same thing for a while. The man you talked about has been behaving poorly. I will fire him in at most six months with or without this phone call. McHale Pharmaceuticals Group needs talents with leadership rather than woodworms who are only interested in seeking personal interest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Marcus actually felt relieved for not interfering with the operation of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he offered it a chance to get rid of an impotent leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, in that case, please sack him, Ms. McHale," said Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia agreed immediately and said, "I will go to Solomia again in a week. Can I invite you to dinner, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft voice made it hard for him to resist her invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he just asked her to do him a favor. To return that, he shouldn't and couldn't turn her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting his agreement, Cecilia hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Molly, Hannah, and Joshua watched Marcus performing with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly said, "With your acting skills, it would be a waste if you don't apply to a film school. The way you made the phone call just now was so vivid that it seemed like you really knew the heiress of the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. How ridiculous!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
