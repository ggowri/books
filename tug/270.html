  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila and Jennifer were both astonished in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Never could they expect Marcus to reach Ancient Martial Stage Four, which was higher than Truman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His power could even compete with their teacher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judging from Marcus' appearance, he seemed to be in his twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a young man with prominent achievement in Ancient Martial Arts was as rare as diamonds in Uswad's Ancient Martial Art world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a bunch of losers with narrow views!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Truman with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason he neglected Truman's offense was not because he was afraid of him; he was just reluctant to waste time on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to his surprise, his tolerance stimulated their arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke thought, "Mr. Fitzgerald actually reached Ancient Martial Stage Four. I was so lucky to submit myself to him yesterday; otherwise, I would have been fucked up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, few people of the young generation of the Ancient Martial Art in Uswad could make all of Truman's power disappear with only one punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bastard, how dare you strip Mr. Dupont of his cultivation? Aren't you afraid that the whole Astral Serpent Order will come after you?" an expert of the Astral Serpent Order threatened Marcus with gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On the count of three. Take this loser out of my sight, or I'll bury all of you here," Marcus said to those experts of the Astral Serpent Order, and their faces all darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they outnumbered Marcus, the highest stage among those experts only reached Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they joined forces, they were no match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the face of his threat, they had no other option but to leave this place of conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their hearts throbbed as they watched Truman and his gang leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nobody expected that such a simple gamble on stones would lead to this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Truman also fled in dismay, the two sisters also turned more careful with their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus could make Truman's training and practice for power in vain with one single punch, let alone them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this very moment, their hearts were in their throats as they were worried about whether Marcus would come to them for the humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he didn't even waste a second glancing at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, there was a burst of applause from the attic somewhere in the courtyard of the Grand Fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all searched for the source of the applause and found an alluring woman in her thirties with a Southvaian face walking downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tall and sexy figure attracted much attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's Ms. Tillman! She's here!" Somebody exclaimed in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was Vanessa Tillman, the owner of the Grand Fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bravo! What a wonderful fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa fixed her narrow eyes on Marcus with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within a few steps, she stood in front of Marcus and looked at him up and down. "You are at Ancient Martial Stage Four in your twenties and devastate Truman's power with only a single punch. I can see your promising future, young man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My name is Vanessa Tillman, and I'm the owner of this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, I founded this place on my own, and I'm still single."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, Ms. Tillman." Marcus took the initiative to reach out to shake hands with Vanessa and felt her tender skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he had quite a good impression of this woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He liked straightforward people like her who always cut to the bone on business rather than those beating on the bush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, many people cast envious eyes on him as he even attracted Vanessa's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did she establish the Grand Fortune on her own, but she still owned many businesses in the Southern Market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, this sexy woman was once known as the sexiest woman in the whole city, with countless men coveting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this titillating lady was not interested in men at all except this young man, who she took the initiative to greet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sure you don't come here to chat, Ms. Tillman. Please tell me how I can help you," Marcus said to Vanessa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would also like to put everything straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, a smart woman like her wouldn't just come to him for small talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I saw how you gambled on stones just now. It surprised me, and I would like to ask whether we can make friends," Vanessa said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, she had focused on Marcus the moment he stepped into the Grand Fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure." Marcus nodded with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination">
