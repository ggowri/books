  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your daughter's husband tried to have me killed," Marcus said coldly, glancing at Louise. "Who's really to blame here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise's face crumpled. "Please, Marcus, Paul wasn't thinking straight! Don't hurt him! What about our Jessica? She's carrying his child!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica dropped to her knees beside her mother, all her previous arrogance gone, replaced by desperation and humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't care less about this shameless mother-daughter duo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus unmoved, Samuel played the elder card. "Look, I'm getting down on my knees too, swallowing my pride as your grandfather. Surely that counts for something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your pride? That's rich. Why should I care about your pride?" Marcus shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face turned beet red. "You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget." Marcus cut in with a bitter laugh. "You're the one who called me worthless. A backstabber. An embarrassment to the Lewis family. You never treated me like a grandson before, but now you're pulling the grandfather card? Have you no shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit like hammer blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's coughing fit from anger was so severe he nearly collapsed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was straightforward in his principles. He'd be good to those who were good to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if someone only knew how to nitpick and mock others, he wouldn't let them off easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if that someone was Melinda's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard shot Marcus an approving look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd long despised this opportunistic man, and it was high time someone taught him a lesson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melinda, is this how you raised your son? Do you really want him to kill us all?" Samuel clutched his chest as he addressed Melinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood ties ran deep, and Melinda couldn't bear to watch Marcus harm her family. She pleaded with him. "Marcus, honey, please, I'm begging you. Do this for me! Spare them just this once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, they're my flesh and blood. I can't watch you hurt them. Marcus, please listen to your mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Melinda's plea, Marcus reluctantly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda had raised him as her son, and unless necessary, Marcus wouldn't harm her blood relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus nodded, Paul and Louise's family finally let out a collective sigh of relief, feeling like death row inmates receiving a last-minute pardon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melinda, thank you, thank you for pleading for us," Louise said gratefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda shot her a cold look. "What you did was absolutely inhuman. I shouldn't be pleading for you at all. I only did it because we're family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if there's a next time, I won't step in. Even if Marcus kills you all, it'll be none of my business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda had always yearned to maintain family bonds, but Louise and her crew treated her like dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's events finally opened Melinda's eyes to a hard truth - blood ties don't guarantee goodwill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise was the perfect example, always green with envy at their success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone had less money than Louise, she'd look down her nose at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's an old saying that fits perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People either resent your wealth or despise your poverty. That was just how it went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise's face was filled with remorse as she replied, "Melinda, you don't have to say another word. We wouldn't dare offend Marcus again. There won't be a next time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing the power Marcus displayed, Louise knew that her daughter and son, even combined, could never reach such heights in their lifetimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, despite the bitter pill she had to swallow, she forced herself to accept reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, now that Paul's lost his job, your cousin Henry will be laid off too. For Christine's sake, couldn't you find him a position somewhere?" Christine finally spoke up, gathering her courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot Christine a glance before letting out a cold laugh. "Weren't you the one bragging about how amazing your son's job was? Why don't you go ask Paul to hook him up? I can't help you with this one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, Marcus could land someone a job with a snap of his fingers, whether it paid five thousand a month, fifty thousand, or even half a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Christine always sided with Louise, insulting Melinda and her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a snobbish and opportunistic person, the kind Marcus despised, so naturally, he ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine's face fell completely after hearing Marcus's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Paul was fired, she had been worried sick about Henry's future employment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She finally worked up the courage to plead with Marcus, but he completely shut her down without any sympathy!</span></p><div class="pagination">
