  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exhaled sharply, swiftly unleashing four bursts of flame to incinerate the remnants on the ground, and then left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had won the battle with overwhelming force, it served as a wake-up call for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously dismissed cyborgs as half-baked products of technology, not worth his concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today's skirmish had taught him that his assumptions were too superficial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, the cyborgs of Eldoria were now on par with traditional warriors, wizards, and metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus realized that the four cyborgs he had just faced were far from the pinnacle of their kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Eldoria sent even more formidable cyborgs to </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, they would pose a significant threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It only strengthened his resolve to enhance his abilities quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Marcus discovered that combining the powers of a warrior with those of a wizard could yield unexpected results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for his improvisation during the fight, merging these two forces, he would not have been able to vanquish those four so quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts in mind, Marcus was determined to develop more combinations of powers to bolster his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arrived at Josie's residence in Sunshine Estates by seven in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus stepped off the elevator, a shrill argument assaulted his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're the CEO of </span><span>BioFusion</span><span> Pharmaceuticals, a renowned businesswoman in Kingston, you're still a woman, and you still need a man's love. I can't believe you've been widowed for so long without craving a man's touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're neighbors, and we could make do. If you agree, I'm at your beck and call, and you won't have to endure the loneliness of an empty bed at night. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced towards Josie's door to see a bare-chested, pot-bellied, drunken middle-aged man tugging at Josie, his lecherous gaze raking over her body as if to undress her with his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, her face twisted in disgust, struggled and declared, "I've told you I don't need a man. If you keep harassing me, I'll call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel sneered in response, "Want to call the cops? Go ahead. By the time they get here, we'll be done with what we're about to do. I'd gladly serve a few years in prison to sleep with a beauty like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Daniel lunged at Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie despaired. She was powerless to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Daniel could even touch Josie, he was intercepted by a broad figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staggered by the impact, he shook his head and cursed, "Damn it! Who dares to mess with my fun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that he noticed Marcus standing protectively beside Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you punk, who the hell are you? How dare you stop me from having my way with a woman? Are you looking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel slurred, clearly intoxicated. The alcohol had bolstered his courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, who had moved in opposite Josie three months prior, had always harbored some vulgar fantasies about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, he only dared to peep at her, but today, fueled by alcohol, he had taken action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm her husband," Marcus replied nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel burst into scornful laughter. "Husband? Keep dreaming. Everyone knows that Ms. Shelman from </span><span>BioFusion</span><span> Pharmaceuticals is single. You think I'm that easy to fool? Get lost, or I'll make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that Marcus noticed his tattoos, signs of a past life in the underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Josie snap out of her shock. Looking at Marcus' imposing figure, Josie couldn't help but cover her mouth and sob quietly, clearly shaken by the events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Single women living alone feared harassment from strange men the most, especially gorgeous women like Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her high status, if Daniel was willing to go to extremes, she, being in a vulnerable position, had no power to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for Marcus' timely arrival, Josie would have been at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, don't cry. I'm here for you." Marcus comforted, patting Josie's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you hear me? Get lost this instant! I've been around the block a few times. If you don't back off, don't blame me for what happens next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's face contorted into a menacing scowl as he grabbed an iron shovel from his doorstep.</span></p><div class="pagination">
