  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone's coming..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the sound, Gertie realized she wasn't dressed yet and hurriedly put on her clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you say no one would come here?" Marcus couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was completely naked at the moment too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have no idea who would come here at this time. Hurry up and get dressed!" Gertie urged Marcus while combing her hair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since his previous clothes were already dirty, Marcus had to take out a brand-new outfit from the Spatial Ring and put it on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hurriedly getting dressed, Gertie suddenly noticed a large damp patch on the bedsheet, emitting a distinct smell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly removed the bedsheet and threw it into the laundry room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gertie, are you there? I heard you came back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a cold voice rang out, growing closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person quickly arrived at the room's door and knocked on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh no, it's Minerva. Hide quickly. She hates men the most..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie's expression became very flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her panic, she didn't know how to face Minerva.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are my girlfriend. It's normal for me to come to your place. I won't hide."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't listen to Gertie and wanted to see what kind of person Minerva was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up. I don't even know how to explain our relationship to Minerva."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus ignore her words, Gertie became even more anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave Gertie a strange look and said, "You don't admit you're my girlfriend? If that's the case, we can stop seeing each other. I'll leave right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying that, Marcus turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie didn't expect Marcus to be so stubborn. She reached out to grab him and said, "Marcus, that's not what I meant. Don't misunderstand. I admit I'm your girlfriend. Please don't leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright," Marcus finally nodded in satisfaction and said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gertie, why aren't you saying anything? I know you're in the room."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, Minerva's voice sounded again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Minerva, wait for me a moment," Gertie quickly responded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that if she didn't respond in time, Minerva would likely barge in directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Minerva saw the scene in the room, Gertie would have no way to explain it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie didn't care if Minerva knew about her relationship with Marcus, but the room was too messy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had just made love. This was the most private thing between Gertie and Marcus, and even though she had a good relationship with Minerva, she didn't want her to know about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go out. Minerva has quite a temper. Just listen while I talk, okay? Don't argue with her, alright?" Gertie whispered to Marcus, as if she was worried he might clash with Minerva.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded. As long as Minerva didn't go too far, he definitely wouldn't embarrass Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus agree, Gertie felt relieved, took a deep breath, opened the door, and walked out with Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva, though a woman who had lived through several samsaras, looked no older than 30 on the surface and was quite beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her figure was very sexy, especially her full breasts, which seemed ready to burst out of her clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her breasts, combined with Minerva's cold demeanor, created an extremely strong visual impact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus then realized that Gertie's figure was inherited from Minerva.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to Gertie's, Minerva's breasts were even fuller.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Minerva was not young, she had never been married. She had been in a relationship before, but it was only at the chatting stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never had physical contact with a man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, Minerva is still a virgin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Gertie, Minerva changed her indifferent expression and showed a beautiful smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gertie, what have you been up to lately? Why haven't you come back?" Minerva asked Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I went traveling," Gertie said somewhat awkwardly, deliberately hiding Marcus's existence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Minerva quickly noticed Marcus standing behind Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva's radiant smile instantly disappeared. She asked, "Gertie, who is this? Why did you bring him to Emotionless Gorge? I told you no men are allowed in Emotionless Gorge. Did you forget?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Questioned by Minerva, Gertie lowered her head in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie lost her mother at a young age and was raised by Minerva.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to Minerva's eccentric personality, Gertie was often scolded as a child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Gertie extremely afraid of Minerva, with an innate sense of fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, every time Minerva got angry, Gertie would tremble uncontrollably in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Minerva, please don't be angry. His name is Marcus, he's my boyfriend..." Gertie said cautiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva's gaze instantly turned icy. She quickly grabbed Gertie's arm and anxiously questioned her, "Did you sleep with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva was trembling with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes. Please don't be angry. We truly love each other, and Marcus treats me very well. I brought him back to Emotionless Gorge so he could help me heal," Gertie replied, trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Gertie's words, Minerva's face darkened with anger, and she raised her hand, attempting to slap Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she couldn't bring herself to do it and slowly lowered her raised hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva said, "Gertie, all these years of my teaching, you've forgotten it all. You still believe a man's words? I've told you before, men are all trash. Why won't you listen?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He treats you well because he wants to have you. Once he gets you, you'll mean nothing to him. Women should love themselves; you can be happy without a man. I've been single my whole life and I'm still very happy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gertie, you really disappoint me. You actually slept with him. Don't you know how important this is for a woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't tell Minerva about Marcus raping her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Minerva's fury, Gertie could only stay silent, or Minerva would get even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Gertie remain silent, Minerva turned to Marcus, her gaze cold and filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva said, "How did you deceive Gertie, and how did you make her willingly sleep with you? You must give me an explanation today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie, sensing trouble, quickly shielded Marcus behind her and said, "Minerva, this has nothing to do with Marcus. I seduced him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva pushed Gertie aside and said coldly, "I'm not talking to you. I'm asking him. He must take responsibility!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus remained calm. After glancing at Minerva, he said, "We love each other, no need to explain. Just because you were deceived by a man, does that mean all men should be blamed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva was stunned for a moment, then angrily said, "What did you say? Who told you that? Bastard, I'll kill you right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Minerva truly angry, Gertie tried to protect Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva pushed Gertie aside again and said, "I'm asking him questions, don't protect him. You're not married yet. Wake up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie quickly explained, "Minerva, don't misunderstand. I'm just afraid you'll get hurt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had witnessed Marcus's immense strength. If they really fought, Minerva definitely wouldn't stand a chance against Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
