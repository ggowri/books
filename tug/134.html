  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Marcus Fitzgerald. Here's my contact info, but forget about the special reward," Marcus said as he handed Maxine a business card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine looked at him quizzically and replied, "Your skills are pretty impressive. I may have misjudged you earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Officer Burnett, I'm flattered. My skills are hardly comparable to yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine rolled her eyes, realizing he was mocking her, and decided to stay silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two made their way to the first-class cabin, which turned out to be a private room with just two seats and a bathroom&mdash;quite peaceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus settled into his seat, closed his eyes, and quickly dozed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine glanced at his profile, clearly tempted to ask him something, but seeing he was asleep, she held her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, the plane touched down safely at Solomia Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the recent hijacking by mercenaries&mdash;who were ultimately killed&mdash;the airport had dispatched a large crew to greet the passengers and promote the heroic efforts of the flight crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, as Marcus and the others disembarked, they were swarmed by media personnel, cameras flashing everywhere, and reporters clamoring to interview the passengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being a key player in the anti-hijacking endeavor, Maxine quickly drew media attention and found herself surrounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her naturally aloof demeanor, she seemed to dislike the spotlight. She answered a few questions curtly before breaking through the throng and heading straight for the airport exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze scanned the area as if searching for someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, her eyes landed on a vehicle parked not too far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was loading Marcus's luggage into the car and preparing to drive off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine took in the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like this guy is a big deal. Maybe I really did misjudge him," she thought to herself as she hailed a taxi and left the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I heard your flight was hijacked," Diana casually remarked as she drove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was relaxed, showing no hint of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was confident that with Marcus's prowess, the ordinary hijackers wouldn't pose any real threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, they seemed to be mercenaries from the Black Hawk Legion," Marcus replied, still resting his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Black Hawk Legion? I see," Diana said, her expression shifting to one of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she drove, she explained, "On the surface, they seem like just another mercenary group, possibly a terrorist organization at worst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there's a powerful force backing them. Along with their trained mercenaries, they've secretly developed orcs and cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some of these have advanced to the levels of warriors, wizards, and metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, by participating in the anti-hijacking, you've put yourself on the Black Hawk Legion's blacklist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're on that list, they'll stop at nothing to kill you. You need to be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained unfazed, keeping his eyes closed. "Well, I've killed them, so if they want revenge, just come to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned, feeling that Marcus could sometimes be overly reckless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take that trip to Kingston a while back&mdash;it sounded thrilling but was incredibly dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo was clearly more powerful than Marcus, and one wrong move could have meant disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus had gone without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he'd returned unscathed, Diana's worry lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he had made enemies with the Black Hawk Legion, but Marcus still seemed indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't quite understand his mindset. Was this simply his unwavering confidence in his abilities?</span></p><div class="pagination">
