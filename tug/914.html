  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered, "I'm telling you, as long as I'm here, you'll never be the head of the family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, Joel immediately burst into laughter&mdash;loud, mocking laughter that left him gasping for air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel scoffed, "Are you out of your mind, or did you get scared stupid? Do you honestly think you're some kind of hero here to save Cecilia? Let me give you a piece of advice&mdash;think long and hard about what happens if you get involved." Then, his laughter faded, replaced by a cold smirk. "To be honest? Someone like you? I could crush you with just a flick of my wrist!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia, looking worried, immediately spoke up, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I appreciate what you're doing, but you shouldn't get involved. They really will kill you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she turned to Joel, begging, "This has nothing to do with Mr. Fitzgerald. Please don't drag him into this, Uncle Joel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel let out a short, disdainful laugh. "He's got no one to blame but himself for not knowing when to back off. He insisted on getting involved&mdash;too late for regrets now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he waved his hand, and in an instant, snipers hidden in the shadows stepped forward, their rifles trained on Marcus. Dozens of gun barrels locked onto him at once, and the entire space grew heavy with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even with all those sniper scopes aimed right at him, Marcus didn't so much as flinch. His expression remained unchanged, steady as ever. He looked Joel dead in the eye and retorted, "Do you really think that before they can pull the trigger, I won't have killed you a hundred times over?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment those words left Marcus' </span><span>mouth,</span><span> the entire room fell silent. No one had expected him to be so brazen in the face of this situation. It was like he had no sense of self-preservation at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel's eyes narrowed before his lips curled into a cruel smirk, sneering, "Since you're so confident, I guess I'll have to test whether you can actually back up that big talk!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, his men readied their weapons. The next moment, the air filled with the sound of gunfire&mdash;round after round tearing through the space as bullets rained toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the barrage of bullets closed in toward Marcus, Cecilia's face went pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't stop herself&mdash;she shut her eyes, unable to watch Marcus get gunned down. And she wasn't the only one. The others in the room did the same, unwilling to witness what they thought would be his inevitable death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when they finally opened their eyes again, the sight they had braced for never came. Marcus was gone. He had vanished from where he had been standing. Instead, without anyone realizing when it happened, he was now right in front of Joel, one large hand wrapped tightly around his throat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel's face twisted in shock and rage. His breathing suddenly labored as Marcus' grip tightened. He could feel the pressure increasing, and there was no doubt in his mind&mdash;if Marcus wanted to, he could snap his neck in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't believe it. Not in his wildest dreams had he imagined Marcus could move this fast. He hadn't even seen how it happened&mdash;one moment Marcus was across the room, and the next, he was right in front of him, moving like a ghost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered at Joel, "I told you from the start not to try anything reckless, but you just had to ignore me. Your so-called sharpshooters couldn't even track my movements, let alone land a hit on me."</span></p><div class="pagination">
