  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She admitted she had been prejudiced before. It seemed Maxine had a good eye for choosing a boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing Marcus' prowess, Stella thought he was flawless and the epitome of a perfect man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen approached, chuckling, "Hazel's right. I'm on board with your marriage, but I'm afraid Marcus might not be willing to marry Maxine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words had a teasing tone, but there was a hint of sincerity behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the patriarch of the Burnett family for over a decade, Owen had seen it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the strength and presence Marcus just displayed, it was clear he was not an ordinary man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man like him wouldn't be short of female companionship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Maxine was excellent in Owen's eyes, he wasn't sure if Marcus would be interested in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, please stop it. I was just fooling you. I said Marcus was my boyfriend to avoid marrying Shaun. We're just friends," Maxine explained, her face flushing with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had some understanding of Marcus and knew he was surrounded by women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine wasn't bothered by it. As an adult, she understood that outstanding men wouldn't lack female attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her insecurity that made her doubt Marcus would fall for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had been cold towards Marcus, even mistaking him for a pervert at the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus must have had a poor impression of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, in Maxine's view, Marcus would never be interested in a girl like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen and Ruth exchanged glances, not buying her explanation. Hazel said, "Maxine, don't try to explain. Your father and I have been there. We understand you. The way you two look at each other is different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen laughed and said, "Let's not talk about this anymore. Let the young ones figure it out. Maxine is blushing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the sudden turn of events, the birthday party was cut short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Matthew was unusually delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had cured his illness, and the internal conflicts within the Burnett family had been entirely resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the person who resolved everything had an intimate relationship with Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It allowed Matthew to forgo the enormous benefits of an alliance with the Whitman family and fully lean towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the turmoil ended, the guests dispersed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this incident affected too many people's interests, the news was suppressed before everyone left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All photos and videos, including those already uploaded online, were forcibly deleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could protect the interests of most people, maintain the image of the Burnett family, and prevent unnecessary panic in society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the eyes of ordinary people, warriors were still very mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people had only heard fragments about warriors, and few had actually seen them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous fighting scene was too shocking to be casually spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To thank Marcus, the Burnett family wanted to invite him to dinner, but Marcus declined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had other matters to attend to and left the Burnett Villa after saying goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness Ms. Maxine Burnett stopped me before, or I would have died miserably! Why did that guy provoke such a monster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald witnessed Marcus' performance at the birthday party and was too shocked to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how he had led the underworld to attack Marcus, he felt cold sweat on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was extremely grateful he hadn't acted impulsively. Otherwise, he might not see the sunrise tomorrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me walk you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine followed Marcus, walking out of the Burnett Villa together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They strolled down a tranquil path, with green pines on either side and fresh air around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Marcus," Maxine said after a while, taking the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fidgeted with the corner of her dress, unsure of what else to say, and finally just expressed her gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you many times that we're friends. You don't have to thank me," Marcus smiled casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, when Maxine heard Marcus emphasize that they were friends, a hint of disappointment welled up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine continued, "If it weren't for you this time, not only would our Burnett family face extinction, but I would also have to marry that jerk Shaun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, does your previous promise still stand?" Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange expression crossed Maxine's face. She had almost guessed what Marcus was getting at, but she still pretended not to know. "What did I say?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
