Their strength is indeed formidable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross continued, "Then how do we, the Walsh family, compare to the Bloodthirsty Cult?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's eyes narrowed as he answered coldly, "Though the Walsh family occupies a major part of the entertainment industry in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, we've never been able to control our own power. We're still not in a position to rival the Bloodthirsty Cult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross' face turned sour when he heard this, and with a hint of resentment, he asked, "So, according to you, I just have to swallow this humiliation? Let that damn guy bully me like this without fighting back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of him bowing publicly in front of Marcus and slapping his own face filled Ross with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary wore a cold expression. He said, "Of course not. That guy hit my grandson, and I won't let this go easily. I have been in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> for many years, and I have built up </span><span>some connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Ross. When the time comes, I'll ask the Swords Sect to deal with him. As long as he's still in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, he won't escape my grasp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ross nodded in satisfaction, eagerly awaiting the moment when Marcus would fall into his grandfather's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus was unaware of what was happening at </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had returned to Bayside Villa and was about to enter his cultivation state when he received a WhatsApp message from Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie: [Marcus, my mom is being discharged today, and she wants to invite you to our house for a visit to thank you properly.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie: [My mom specifically asked me to make sure you come. She said you must come, and if you don't, I won't know how to explain it to her.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, remembering that the last time he had taken Natalie home, he had also helped save her mother, Mia, from stomach cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she had asked him so insistently, Marcus felt he couldn't refuse and agreed to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting was set for two PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, considering that Mia was being discharged today, Marcus had already left early to pick them up from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Aston Martin couldn't fit three people, so he rented a new Audi A6 from Golden Group and headed to Bayside Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus had visited before, he quickly found Mia's hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Natalie was packing things up for Mia, sweat beading on her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, Marcus is here!" Mia immediately spotted Marcus outside the door and reminded Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie looked surprised and turned instinctively, only to see Marcus' handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She checked the time. It was still eleven AM. She asked Marcus, "Marcus, why are you at the hospital? You can just come to our house for lunch at two PM."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "I thought the discharge process might be troublesome, so I came to help you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're so busy with work, and yet you're being so kind. I'm already so grateful for the treatment you gave me last time. I didn't expect you'd still help out today. I feel so bad!" Mia said with a smile, growing fonder of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was no longer a young girl, and she didn't have a serious partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia, hoping to matchmake, was eager to pair her daughter with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Vance, no need to thank me. Natalie and I were classmates. It's no trouble at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was also very happy to see Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his help, the discharge procedures went smoothly, and there was no need for Natalie to run around. Everything was quickly taken care of.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
