  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the door was shut, they both finally relaxed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus threw Josie onto the bed with a rough motion. She gasped in surprise, and before she could react, he had already spread her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrust forward powerfully, driving himself in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Marcus, you're so... strong... You've filled me completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's face was painted with a look of uncontrollable desire as her body writhed beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, I'm going to start now," Marcus murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quiet warning, he felt the tight grip around him and began moving with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm... oh... ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie gazed lovingly at the man working passionately above her. Her body and soul were overwhelmed with pleasure, as if every inch of her skin was alive with sensation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's skin glistened with sweat, his solid muscles contracting and relaxing in rhythm, creating powerful, defined lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense visual appeal completely captivated Josie, and she met his every move with fervent enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every thrust from Marcus sent waves of excitement coursing through Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After years of being single, she had long yearned for such intimacy, and to experience it with a man she loved was the ultimate happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... I can't hold on... Don't stop, go faster... It feels so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus's movements grew more intense, Josie gripped his shoulders tightly, her nails digging deep enough to draw tiny beads of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paid no mind and let his desires take over completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus's first release, Josie reached her second climax, her body tightening rhythmically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt utterly content, her mind blank and serene...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she were floating on a cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her completely forget herself, forget everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Josie could catch her breath, Marcus shifted positions and continued his advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The change in angle brought new waves of sensation, leaving Josie intoxicated with pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's skillful technique and strong physique were unlike anything she had experienced before, making her past routine encounters with her late husband pale in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Josie truly understood the joy of being a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of soaring above the clouds was an indescribable bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt like she could die now, and it would still be worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was equally overwhelmed; Josie was unlike any woman he had ever been with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her transformation from a previously reserved woman to someone so passionate ignited his most primal desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept changing positions, using every skill he had to bring Josie to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's body tightened rhythmically, and her essence had already soaked the sheets. The room was filled with the heady scent of passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her moans of ecstasy, paired with the rhythmic sound of their bodies meeting, heightened both their senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, at a certain moment, they reached an unprecedented climax together, releasing everything they had!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's face was flushed, her body glistening with fragrant sweat. Her expression radiated pure happiness, and her body continued to tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pulled back, wiped the sweat from his brow, and lay on the bed, lighting a cigarette and exhaling slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Josie stirred from her blissful state. Glancing down in slight surprise at herself, she asked, "Marcus... did you... finish inside me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's question brought Marcus back to reality. He realized that, caught up in the moment, he hadn't taken any precautions and had released everything inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, I'm sorry. I couldn't control myself," Marcus said apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie asked, "Well... if I get pregnant, would you accept the baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was taken aback. He wasn't ready to be a father and didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just teasing you. It's my safe period, so it probably won't happen. But, you know, people say the safe period isn't completely safe... so maybe you should get ready to be a dad anyway!" Josie joked with a playful grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was genuinely nervous now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If just one time was enough to slip up, he'd be a dad in no time. The thought alone made his head spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered asking Josie to take emergency contraception but dismissed the idea when he remembered how harmful it could be to her health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it," Marcus thought to himself. "I'm a grown man&mdash;if I did it, I should face the consequences. If it happens, I'll take responsibility..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt uneasy but resolved himself inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, did you enjoy it?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook off his thoughts and asked Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During intimacy, most men care more about their partner's experience than their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ensuring a partner's satisfaction is a true measure of one's ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie blushed and replied, "It was amazing... I've never felt like this before. Marcus, promise me you'll never leave me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Josie leaned gently into Marcus's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stroked Josie's hair and said softly, "Don't worry, I won't leave you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, why are you still calling me Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's beautiful eyes flickered with understanding, but she hesitated, finding it difficult to say the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After mustering her courage, she finally said, "Honey..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
