  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left Harvey's </span><span>mouth,</span><span> the two trendy guys next to him burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Solomia might be a top ten city in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, but it was no match for Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like they had an invisible badge of superiority pinned to their chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the other girls kept their expressions neutral, their eyes sparkled with the unmistakable gleam of spectators enjoying the drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, Natalia was still a catch, even though she wasn't from a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Harvey were a perfect match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was from some backwater town like Solomia and was an unemployed </span><span>bum to boot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As both classmates and close confidants of Natalia, they harbored a collective dislike for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, when they witnessed Harvey mocking Marcus, an inexplicable joy stirred within each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and Judy felt the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Natalia frowned. "Marcus has been to Kingston plenty of times. I bet he's seen fancier places than this. I don't appreciate you talking down to him. If you keep it up, I think we can just call this party quits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't about to let Harvey disrespect Marcus, even if Harvey was the golden boy of the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other girls, Melina and Judy included, were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't understand what was so special about Marcus that made Natalia defend him so fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being called out like that in public clearly irked Harvey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't explode. Instead, he plastered a gentlemanly smile back on his face, "Natalia, I apologize. I guess I got carried away. I was just trying to be honest for his own good. I hope you're not offended."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His apology sounded sincere, so Natalia let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two trendy guys next to him rolled their eyes. They were Harvey's friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd never seen him bow down to a woman like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the first girl to make Mr. Burnett lower himself like that," one of them, a guy named Troy Stevens, said. "Natalia, I hope you appreciate this opportunity to have dinner with Mr. Burnett. Don't go messing it up because of some nobody. If you do, you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other guy, Peter Short, chimed in with a sneer, "Girls her age are all the same. They're blinded by love. You could call them stupid, but when they defend their country bumpkin, they're sharper than anyone. But if you call them smart, they still can't see what's right in front of them. I can't even begin to understand it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their words were clearly aimed at Marcus, thinly veiled insults designed to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their sarcasm was unmistakable, resonating clearly with everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the room turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A minute of awkward silence hung in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to diffuse the tension, Melina called for the waiter and had the red wine poured. </span><span>Personally</span><span> filling each glass with care and attention, she raised her glass and declared with flair, "Here's to us, the elite of Kingston University, including beauties, hunks, and luminaries like Mr. Burnett. To new friendships!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she drained her wine in one decisive gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, Troy, and Peter immediately clapped and cheered, following suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, in her beautiful evening dress, looked stunning under the lights. Her perfect figure was accentuated, and her smooth skin glowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The subtle glimpse of cleavage through her dress added an extra layer of allure to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she sipped from her glass of wine, her complexion seemed to glow, turning whiter with a rosy blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy and Peter were practically buzzing with excitement, eager to test their fortunes. Even Harvey, usually so composed, couldn't hide the flicker of greed that danced in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio exchanged knowing glances, a silent agreement passing between them. They raised their glasses, toasting to the girls who graced the room with their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one was exempt from the round of toasts, not even Natalia. She had little desire to drink, but Melina and Judy were relentless, urging her to join in the revelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only one left out was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Natalia, everyone seemed to overlook Marcus, who filled his own glass with deep red wine and drank it alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he appeared utterly unfazed by the isolation. His true purpose for attending wasn't the party or the social mingling; he was there to size up the kind of person Melina had introduced to Natalia and, if necessary, to issue a discreet warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that most of the girls were getting tipsy, Harvey said, "I'm having a great time with all </span><span>you</span><span> beauties. I suggest we all head over to my villa for a party and have some real fun tonight!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
