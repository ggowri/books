  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas' face lit up at Simon's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Growing up under their mother's influence, they had never seen Jane as a sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To them, she was nothing but a cash cow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't care less about her well-being as long as they got what they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simon had barely finished speaking when Lucas stood up from his seat and approached Jane, extending his hand. "Jane, give me your car keys. I'm going to town right now to sell it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane shot Lucas a fierce glare. "It's my car. What right do you have to take it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas frowned, his voice turning icy. "Are you going to hand them over or not? If not, you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't repeat myself," Jane said coldly. She had seen through these people's true nature and wasn't about to give in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Playing it the hard way, huh? Don't blame me for what happens next." Lucas' anger seemed to flare as he reached out to grab the keys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before his hand could reach Jane, Marcus grabbed his wrist in a firm grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas fixed his gaze on Marcus, his face ice-cold. "Pretty boy, are you asking for death? How dare you meddle in my family's business? You must have a death wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish speaking, Lucas swung his fist at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't let him get away with it. He slapped Lucas hard across the face, sending him stumbling backward with blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy, Simon, and Tristan stood frozen in shock at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of them had expected Marcus would dare to strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You pretty boy! How dare you hit my brother? Do you have a death wish?" Tracy shot up from her seat, fixing Marcus with an icy glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You disrespectful brat. He'd deserve worse than that," Marcus replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never met such a shameless family before. For years, they had been nothing but parasites, living off Jane's generosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane had even paid for Tracy and Lucas' college tuition. Yet despite everything, they still refused to show her any gratitude. Instead, they were trying to squeeze every last penny out of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their latest scheme was to marry her off to the mayor's dim-witted son, hoping to use the wedding gifts to fund Lucas' business venture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What kind of father would do such a thing? How was he any different from a demon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until now, Marcus had stayed out of it since this was Jane's family matter. But Lucas had clearly crossed Marcus' line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at this, Jane. This is the pretty boy you're keeping. He dares to hit your brother in our house! If you don't break up with him today, you're no longer my daughter," Simon shouted, his body trembling with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane had completely lost faith in her family. She stood up and said, "Fine. Perfect. Now I see you all for who you really are. If you want to cut ties with me, then I'll have nothing more to do with any of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Jane took Marcus' hand and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hold it." Before they could leave the house, a voice rang out from the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone turned to look. A balding man carrying a briefcase strode into the yard with a group of people, effectively blocking the doorway of the large brick house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next to the balding man stood a vacant-eyed, disheveled man who appeared mentally challenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Cain is here about the marriage proposal. Let's go greet him," Simon said, his eyes lighting up with excitement. He walked out with Tracy, Lucas, and Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Simon, we haven't finalized this marriage yet. Why is your daughter trying to leave? You promised me she'd marry my Bobby tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If your daughter leaves, you better pay me back that 200 thousand dollars I advanced you right away. No, make that 250 thousand dollars. The extra 50 thousand dollars is for interest and breach of contract," Christopher demanded as he watched Simon's family emerge from their room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's eyes widened as understanding dawned on her. So that was why her father had been so desperate to marry her off. He'd already taken 200 thousand dollars from Christopher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, Mr. Cain, how could you say that?" Simon replied with a nervous smile plastered across his face. "I gave you my word, didn't I? My daughter just needs to take care of something. She's not really leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now that you've brought Bobby here, let's make this engagement official today and have the wedding tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher nodded with satisfaction at Simon's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Cain, this marriage was arranged between you and my father without my consent. He doesn't have the right to make this decision for me, so this arrangement isn't valid," Jane stated firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher's brow furrowed as he turned his gaze back to Simon. "Simon, what's going on here? I need an explanation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sharp sound of a slap echoed through the room as Simon stepped forward and struck Jane across the face. "What kind of game are you playing? You're my daughter, and you'll do as I say. Do you understand?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
