  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston's voice trembled as he asked Lydia, "Ms. Gray, you're not joking, right? Is he really Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Preston still held onto a glimmer of hope in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this young man before him didn't look anything like the legendary figure he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I really need to lie to you? I'm not that bored," Lydia replied, rolling her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston's expression fell completely. He never dreamed that he had actually offended his direct superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to make matters worse, he had done so in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Preston tried to approach Marcus to apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could even speak, Lydia interrupted him, saying, "Preston, you privately mobilized the military, disrupted civilian life, caused severe social unrest, and offended Mr. Fitzgerald in this way. The higher-ups have already made their decision: you are dismissed from all your posts. You can retire and go home now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, Preston's body froze in place. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said to Lydia, "Lydia, you're just an assistant to Mr. Fitzgerald. Do you really think you're some kind of important executive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a military-grade officer appointed by </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> armed forces. Unless the higher-ups issue a direct order, what gives you the right to decide my dismissal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia sneered and said, "In less than a minute, you'll receive an email from the higher-ups with the official document of your dismissal. You can read it yourself, no need to shout at me here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston's face turned grim. He knew exactly what such official emails were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to appointments and dismissals, many special tasks were also sent out in this way to individuals' emails first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The official hard copies would come later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this email also carried legal weight&mdash;once issued, it was effectively recognized as official.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Preston was about to speak, the sound of an incoming email notification rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled as he took out his phone to check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The email displayed was identical to what Lydia had said: it was the official dismissal notice from </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> military headquarters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston nearly fainted. His head spun, and for a moment, his mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could never have imagined that the position he had fought for half his life would vanish in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all because he had offended the one person he shouldn't have&mdash;Marcus, the Special Advisor personally appointed by Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts, Preston was immediately overwhelmed with regret. His eyes turned to Aiden and Finley, filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because of Aiden and Finley that he had ended up offending Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was this offense that had caused him to lose everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Preston even more was the zero-tolerance policy his superiors had for anyone who crossed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, even a military officer like himself, if dismissed, would have had the </span><span>decision made after a higher-up meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here he was, one second facing off against Marcus, and the next, being dismissed without any warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he realized that even some military region commanders didn't carry the same weight of authority as Marcus did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley, Aiden, Ronald, and the others were also struggling to process what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected such a turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston, a high-ranking military officer, had been dismissed just like that...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade, who was standing beside Marcus, was already in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "No wonder Marcus had remained so calm throughout everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was facing Aiden, Finley, or even Preston just now, he was never afraid. He seemed completely unbothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turns out this calmness came from his strength."</span></p><div class="pagination">
