  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, Shannon had just started university and, being passionate about martial arts, she sought out a fighting club to join.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as a woman, and with her relatively small and frail build at the time, most professional clubs turned her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Ewan who stood up for her, insisting that she be allowed to join the Tiger Fist Fighting Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over time, Shannon faced numerous challenges in her training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan provided substantial help, offering guidance on her techniques and pushing her to improve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just two years, Shannon had become the club's top female fighter, even winning the women's division championship at the Solomia Martial Arts Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon was incredibly grateful to Ewan and had always tried to repay him in her own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as time went on, Ewan's true intentions began to show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He persistently asked her to be his girlfriend, but Shannon saw him only as a mentor and a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never thought of him in a romantic way, and, more importantly, Ewan didn't meet her standards for a partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite his help, he was petty, narrow-minded, and overly calculative&mdash;qualities that Shannon didn't think should be present in a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After rejecting him numerous times, Ewan refused to take no for an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recently, he had even started telling people at Tiger Fist Fighting Club that Shannon was his girlfriend and demanded she do things as his "girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, today he had invited her to a class reunion, but Shannon, not wanting to go, had been ignoring his calls at the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When this topic came up, Ewan and his friends&mdash;fellow fighters from the club&mdash;cast wary glances at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They, too, were martial artists, and upon hearing that Marcus was also a skilled fighter, they grew more interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sneer, Ewan spoke up, "Shannon, I know you're eager to defend this guy, but there's no need to exaggerate for him." He scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard someone defeated a ninth-degree black belt in karate in the arena earlier today, but this guy... he doesn't look like someone capable of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan believed Shannon was exaggerating for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The edited version of the news they had seen only showed Marcus defeating Easton, and they hadn't seen any footage of the actual fight with the ninja, which had been deliberately cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon rolled her eyes. "If you don't believe me, then fine, I'm not going to argue with you." She began walking toward the university gate, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ewan stepped in her way, determined. "Since you say this guy defeated the black belt, then, as the provincial fighting champion, I'd love to see what he's really made of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today, let everyone here be a witness to how I defeat him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Ewan tried to throw the first punch at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon immediately stepped forward to block him, frustration evident in her voice. "Ewan, will you stop acting like this? You know Marcus defeated the ninth-degree black belt. What are you trying to prove? And just so you know, the footage you've seen was edited. Marcus didn't just defeat the black belt&mdash;he also took down someone far stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't want to embarrass yourself, I'd suggest you back off. You're out of your league here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words were sharp, showing no respect for Ewan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon had reached her limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If you considered things from Shannon's perspective, her frustration was completely understandable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had told him no countless times, and he just wouldn't listen, pushing harder each time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His harassment and constant disruptions had become unbearable, and his recent behavior only made things worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone in her shoes might have blocked him long ago, but Shannon had refrained out of respect for the help he had once given her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her warning now was out of kindness&mdash;she didn't want him to make a fool of himself against Marcus, whose abilities Shannon had witnessed firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want Ewan to suffer humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to Ewan, Shannon's words felt like the deepest insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could the woman he liked look down on him like this? No man could bear such a humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Enraged, Ewan's face twisted in fury. He turned to Shannon, his voice a low growl, "If you think he's so great, I have no choice but to defeat him in front of you. I'll crush him, and you'll see for yourself how weak he really is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before anyone could react, Ewan lunged at Marcus, throwing a powerful punch toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young men around them stepped back, eagerly anticipating Ewan's triumph. They were all from the Tiger Fist Fighting Club, and they were hoping to witness Ewan's victory over Marcus&mdash;surely, the outcome would be a foregone conclusion.</span></p><div class="pagination">
