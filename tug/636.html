  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus changed positions, Jade felt her deepest organs being continuously impacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was so intense that she momentarily forgot herself, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reveled in Marcus' fiery passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus channeled the force of Dual Cultivation to its peak, thrusting while absorbing the benefits it brought to his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Jade reached her fourth climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't hold back any longer and began a frenzied series of thrusts, reaching his own peak and exploding in ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this intense session, Jade lost consciousness for a while, trembling as she lay in the chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took her a long time to wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You jerk. You're always so rough with me," Jade grumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed. "You told me to go harder. Don't you remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade blushed. "Don't say that. You're so crude. It's embarrassing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Marcus dropped Jade off at the staff dormitory of Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then drove his Aston Martin to the headquarters of Bayside Petroleum Company, founded by Lonnie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie was in his office, reviewing documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden knock on the door interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door opened, and several men carried in Joan, who was covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie was shocked. "Who did this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men replied, "It was the guy who attacked Mrs. Jenkins at the jewelry store today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie fumed with rage. "I sent you to deal with him. How did this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man explained the series of events involving Bob and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie frowned. "I can't believe that bastard is connected to Serpent's Coil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, kill that guy. You have to kill him!" Joan, now awake, muttered incoherently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too late for that." A sudden voice suddenly echoed from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to see a young man casually walking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie scowled. "Who are you? How dare you barge into my office?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan trembled. "Honey, it's him. He beat me up. I can't believe he showed up here. Don't let him get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Marcus shot her in the forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened with horror, and she collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent in shock. No one expected Marcus to kill so brazenly in their territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They reached for their weapons, but Marcus was faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fired quickly, taking out everyone around Lonnie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie trembled, sweat pouring down his face. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "Your wife brought so many guys trying to kill me. Isn't it obvious what I want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie backed away, terrified. "I apologize for any offense. Whatever you want, I'll give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too late. You can go to meet your maker now," Marcus said, shooting Lonnie in the temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lonnie fell to the floor, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, the chairman of Bayside Petroleum Company and his wife were no more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't linger. He leaped from the high-rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reaching Ancient Martial Stage Eight, he acquired flight abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he couldn't fly, he could jump great distances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dropping from such a height was no problem for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the cover of the night, no one noticed his departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the employees discovered the bodies, Marcus was long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police arrived quickly and pulled up the surveillance footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, all the cameras in the area had mysteriously malfunctioned during the incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no footage of the killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This case bore a striking resemblance to other recent murders in the country.</span></p><div class="pagination">
