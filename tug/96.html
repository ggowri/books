  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say? Say that again to my face!" Paul's brows furrowed instantly as his temper flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold snicker. "I don't waste time talking to people who can't hear straight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"BANG!" Paul slammed his fist on the table, his face red with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jessica told me all about you! You're nothing but a kept man, living off your wife's money. What right do you have to question anything I say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you try making something of yourself first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Paul a measured look. "Which construction site are you working at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's expression turned smug instantly. "Have you heard about that new pharmaceutical company being built on Bayside Avenue? It's a Golden Group investment! It cost over twenty billion in total."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He boasted, "I've got a small contract there, supplying cement and sand for the construction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get down on your knees and apologize right now, I'll pretend this never happened. I might even help you land a job at the site."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't be bothered with Paul's self-important attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Paul hadn't dragged Nicole into this, Marcus probably wouldn't have said a word during the entire meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, socializing with these relatives was pointless. It was just a waste of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't be continuing that contract anymore," Marcus stated flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up and walked aside to make a phone call...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What bullshit are you spouting?" Paul sneered. "You're just a worthless kept man living off your wife. Who do you think you are? My boss is the project manager of Solomia's top construction company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think you have the power to get me fired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica shot Marcus a dirty look. "Honey, don't waste your time on him. Who would've thought, after all these years, this live-in husband would grow such an attitude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With his pathetic connections? He's nothing compared to my husband. Talking about getting him fired! What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise and Christine joined in the laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at Paul here, trying to do right by Melinda's family, finding Nicole a good match," Christine sneered. "Then this good-for-nothing had to stick his nose where it doesn't belong! Dad was right, Melinda. You never should've adopted this ungrateful brat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole had barely turned eighteen, and this 'project manager' Paul was pushing for was some sleazy fifty-something-year-old with terrible hygiene and rotting yellow teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jessica, Christine, don't waste your breath on him!" Louise chimed in. "I'd love to see him try to get Paul fired. What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his age, Samuel was quite the snob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among his three daughters, he always favored Louise's family while looking down his nose at Melinda, who lived modestly without money or connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel sat there with a smug grin plastered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda and Richard's faces darkened as they took in the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined their flesh and blood could be so two-faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Louise and her crew had at least kept their disdain under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ever since Jessica married Paul, they'd dropped all pretense, flaunting their contempt out in the open!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hung up the phone and returned to his seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well? Am I fired? You seemed so sure of yourself earlier! I almost believed you could actually pull it off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All talk and no action. Jessica, how did you end up with such a worthless excuse for a cousin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's arrogance reached new heights as Marcus returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus maintained his composure as he asked, "This boss you're talking about, would that be Jonathan Whitby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just wait and see, Paul and his crew will be crying their eyes out soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well," Paul sneered, "for a loser, you sure know your stuff. Didn't expect you to know our boss's name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied casually, "He's working on the river renovation project nearby. He'll be here to see me in five minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was stunned by these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had actually guessed it right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The construction company had received a last-minute notice about river management work in Yolanda Village today, and Jonathan had been assigned to oversee it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of Jonathan's employees, Paul had just returned from the riverside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did this loser know about this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he really know Mr. Whitby?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way in hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a deadbeat like him, a kept man whose wife cheated on him, who got kicked out of his home and had to work as a driver just to survive, possibly know someone as important as Mr. Whitby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, is what Marcus saying true?" Jessica asked, remembering Paul mentioning the river project that morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face darkened as he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's expressions changed as they realized something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This suggested Marcus might actually know Jonathan personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How else would he know Jonathan's whereabouts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the tide turning against Marcus, Paul's eyes lit up as a thought struck him. He whipped out his phone and pulled up a webpage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the government planning website where every Solomia project was publicly listed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's river management project was right there, clearly showing Jonathan as the site manager and Paul as the crew foreman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look for yourselves! I told you this loser couldn't possibly know Mr. Whitby personally. He must have just seen it on this website!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
