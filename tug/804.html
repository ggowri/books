  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, </span><span>take</span><span> a look at these," Grace said firmly, pulling a stack of documents from her bag. "This is all the evidence I've gathered. It proves beyond a doubt that my father is innocent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The files included financial records and accounts from Benjamin's time as mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. Everything was meticulously organized, leaving no room for ambiguity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Grace could hand them over to Pablo, Arabella snatched the papers from her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of her wrist, Arabella tossed the documents into a nearby trash can. Her expression was smug, her tone even more so. "Mr. Ashford has already said the evidence against your father is ironclad. Do you really think you can challenge the findings of an entire task force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face turned red with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are official government documents! You have no right to throw them away!" she snapped, stepping forward to retrieve them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A security guard quickly intercepted her, blocking her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella let out a mocking laugh, her voice dripping with condescension. "Official documents? Don't make me laugh. Who knows if those are even real? You can get a fake government seal printed at any corner shop for a few bucks. Do you honestly think you can fool us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to the nearest security guard and smirked. "Tell me, wouldn't forging government documents be considered a crime?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella, emboldened by her connections and status as Pablo's confidant, expected nothing less than compliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard, eager to please, nodded quickly. "Of course it's a crime. Under </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> laws, forging government documents can get you three to five years in prison. If it's serious enough, the sentence could go up to eight years or more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella's smirk widened. "Well then, there you have it. Arrest her. I'm confident those files are fake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards moved to seize Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward, shielding Grace with his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since his arrival, Marcus had stayed quiet, almost blending into the background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all eyes were on him as he finally made his presence known.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella turned her icy gaze to Marcus, her arms crossed. "And who do you think you are? Do you honestly believe you can interfere with our work? If you're not careful, you'll find yourself arrested right alongside her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She came from a powerful family, with both parents holding prominent positions in </span><span>the government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as one of Pablo's closest confidants, she had become even more arrogant and self-important. Over time, her entitlement had grown into a blatant sense of superiority, and she wouldn't tolerate anyone standing in her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked. "Tell me, what crime have I committed that makes you think you can arrest me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The question caught everyone off guard. Whispers rippled through the crowd as they took in Marcus' audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella was momentarily stunned. She hadn't expected him to push back so boldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're interfering with an official investigation. That's crime enough," she said, her voice shaky but still laced with indignation. "What's the problem? Not afraid of a little jail time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her argument was flimsy at best, and even some of the bystanders seemed unimpressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a step closer, his eyes locked on hers. "And which law in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> states that questioning the OIG's actions is a crime? More importantly, you're making baseless arrests. Why shouldn't I stop you? Just because you work for the OIG doesn't mean you're above the law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella's face darkened. Her hands moved to her hips as she tried to regain control. "I never said we're above the law! I'm arresting her because she's forging documents!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' smirk deepened, his voice calm but cutting. "Great. If forgery is such a serious offense, then the person who should be arrested is standing right here. It's Pablo Ashford."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell silent. Eyes widened in disbelief as they processed Marcus' accusation. No one had expected Marcus to point the finger directly at Pablo, let alone so openly and fearlessly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
