  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't witnessed Jane's wild side, Marcus would never have guessed that such a stunning and elegant woman could be what she was truly like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you just standing there? Get in the car, it's cold outside," Jane urged, seeing Marcus hadn't moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped out of the car and opened the passenger door herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a back street with hardly any taxis passing by, leaving Marcus no choice but to get in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intrigued, he asked, "How did you know I was here? Were you following me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she drove, Jane explained, "I just called Natalia. She told me you were here at Serpent's Coil, so I waited nearby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus realized in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, what are you doing at Serpent's Coil? Thinking about joining a gang?" Jane gave him a flirtatious smile, glancing at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serpent's Coil was one of Solomia's three largest underground gangs, known for its formidable strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane had no idea Marcus was the hidden boss of Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kept his intentions to himself and merely said, "Nothing much, just wandering around. Take me to Bayside Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane nodded, pressed down the gas pedal, and the engine roared as the car sped down the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they seemed to be headed in a direction that wasn't toward Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned and questioned, "What are you playing at? Where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane smirked mysteriously, saying, "You'll see when we get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't say anything more; he would see what tricks Jane had up her sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was just the bravery that came with strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Jane's fast driving, they left the Solomia city limits within just over ten minutes, arriving at a small mountain road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane parked the car, looking at Marcus with eyes full of tender affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you bring me to this deserted place?" Marcus asked, not interested in wasting time with Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane bit her lip, displaying a wanton demeanor. "You promised to make me yours at the Winchester family's country villa yesterday... now it's time to fulfill that promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could react, Jane had climbed over the gear stick area. She straddled him with her long legs, pushing the car seat back and kissing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey... I missed you so much. Come on, fuck me, make me yours... "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's vulgar words flowed from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she wore a light green form-fitting dress that accentuated her voluptuous yet graceful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' dick responded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intoxicating scent filled his nostrils as he flipped over, pinning Jane beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, you sure are slutty, bringing me to such a deserted place just for me to fuck you. Do you really like this kind of setting that much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane licked her red lips, looking unsatisfied. "Car sex, isn't it thrilling? I've never experienced it before, only seen it in movies. I want to try it, honey... Please satisfy me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Jane slipped off her light green dress, revealing her white, firm, and elastic breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't had a child, so her breasts were not only firm but elastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slut, you are such a whore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cursed, directly clamping onto the nipple, sucking hard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... so good... Honey, you're sucking me so good... harder... harder... I... I can't take it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane writhed her glistening white body, her hand wrapping around Marcus' already hardened manhood, pumping it up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her other hand, she swiftly shed the rest of her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her two long legs spread wide, raised high, the depths of her pussy already flooded with anticipation, seemingly welcoming Marcus' arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued to suckle her nipples while teasing her clitoris, eliciting passionate moans from Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was flushed crimson, her body trembling as if electrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus quickened his pace, Jane finally reached her first climax, her vaginal walls contracting sharply, shooting forth a stream of liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slut, I didn't expect you to squirt!" Marcus chuckled</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by the multi-sensory stimulation, he could no longer resist and took his place at the ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! Honey, you're so strong, you've already reached the depths, just thrust into me, take me completely!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
