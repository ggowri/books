  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Nick heard this, he immediately nodded in agreement. "Right, our family is doing well now. We can't just let Richard and the others suffer. Marcus must be having a tough time after getting married. He can't hold his head up. If we can help him make more money, he won't have to depend on others and endure their judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard and Melinda both showed a strange expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could speak, Allan said, "Nick, Aria, Lisa, you're all trying to help Marcus, but don't you see? The entire hospital is treating Marcus with the utmost respect. Even Mr. Lake sees him as an honored guest. Do you really think someone like that needs our help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have to admit, Allan makes a good point," Richard and Melinda thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan just finished, and Lisa immediately felt that there was some truth to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a group of people hurried into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group was led by Carter Lake, the director of Solomia Hospital, followed by experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Cary Grant, who had just treated Nick, was among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene was one that many young doctors in the hospital had never witnessed before. They wondered, "Mr. Lake has such a high status that we rarely get to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, not only did Mr. Lake rush over in a hurry, but he also brought so many experts with him. Who could this important person be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is visiting Solomia Hospital, and this is truly an honor for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter Lake, with his graying hair and a kindly appearance, smiled, "Mr. Fitzgerald, why didn't you let me know you were coming? I should have arranged a proper reception for you. If anything was lacking in the hospitality, I hope you can forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus remained calm despite facing Carter and the group of experts, waving his hand and saying, "There's no need to be so formal, Mr. Lake. I'm just accompanying my uncle for a check-up. I didn't want to disturb anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you are too humble. If you have any needs, Solomia Hospital will do everything we can to assist you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter continued speaking to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must say, I greatly admire this young Master Healer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I had even tried to invite Marcus to be the hospital's honorary advisor, but Marcus had politely declined," thought Carter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To this day, Carter felt it was a significant loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he understood why Marcus had refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A person like Marcus, a Master Healer, wouldn't settle for a hospital like this," Carter thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After exchanging pleasantries, Carter and his team of experts left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, Mr. Lake found out that Marcus was at the hospital and came personally, bringing along so many experts to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This level of sincerity was so extraordinary that even the mayor of Solomia, Benjamin, might not receive such treatment." Everyone was shocked in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It left Nick's family completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially Lisa, who thought to herself, "I was thinking of getting Marcus a stall at the wholesale market to help him earn more money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, it seems like Allan was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone whom even Mr. Lake treats with such respect, how could he possibly need our help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I used to think I was doing pretty well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I have a successful career and a wonderful husband like Allan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But compared to Marcus, my idea of success seems completely irrelevant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Our lives aren't even on the same level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, I didn't realize you were so impressive. I really underestimated you. Please don't take it personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa said to Marcus, her expression full of apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand, not caring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa seemed to remember something and hesitantly asked, "Was that Aston Martin you drove also yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa looked at Marcus and thought to herself, "How foolish I was, thinking I knew everything, assuming Marcus was just someone who cared about appearances and rented that car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now I realize everything was just my imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Marcus' abilities, even if he didn't buy the car himself, someone probably would have gifted it to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus really has done well for himself. Richard, you've adopted such a remarkable child. You must be bringing honor to the family. Even as his uncle, you must be feeling proud."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Marcus and Nick weren't related by blood, Nick had always liked him when Marcus was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Nick praised Marcus, Richard and Melinda exchanged a look and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Allan's phone rang.</span></p><div class="pagination">
