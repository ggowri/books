  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that guy really can't drive. He was left so far behind by us from the beginning. There's no way he can complete the mission!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I knew he was showing off in the restaurant. After this lap, he should be able to understand the gap between himself and professional racing drivers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to say, John's vision is unique. He can tell at a glance that this guy can't drive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All participants in the competition had radios in their cars and could communicate through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing those guys' extremely arrogant voices, Melina's face turned extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kind of regretted letting Marcus participate in the competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm so sorry. I just wanted to treat you to a meal, but I didn't expect you to be involved in this matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said to Marcus apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, John and others had been saying all kinds of sarcastic words to Marcus before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I won't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spoke with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling that he was familiar with the car, he turned on the sports mode directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 3.9t engine suddenly let out an arrogant roar, and the powerful torque of the motor made the whole car suddenly become aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shot out like an arrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the sudden strong push on her back, Melina couldn't help but let out a cry of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on tight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a reminder, releasing his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After advancing to Stage Four of ancient martial arts, Marcus' spiritual power was further enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just by releasing it casually, it could cover an area of dozens of miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he wanted, nothing in this area could escape his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, after mobilizing the power of his spiritual consciousness, Marcus' perception in all aspects was more than 10 times that of normal people!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This powerful perception was comparable to the most sophisticated computer equipment in the world and was naturally not comparable to humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Marcus directly welded the accelerator, the 3.9t engine roared wildly, and the speed of the car soared at a speed visible to the naked eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few seconds, they caught up with the large force ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He controlled the steering wheel skillfully, constantly overtaking the cars in the large group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole process was extremely exciting, yet it was presented smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, who was sitting in the passenger seat, was so scared that cold sweat broke out on her palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always liked hill climbing and racing. After several years of study and practice, Melina believed that she had become a quasi-racing driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even some ordinary racing drivers might not have her superb driving skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina was completely shocked when she saw with her own eyes how Marcus drove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how to control it and hardly ever applied the brakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just controlled the steering wheel with both hands and quickly overtook the vehicle in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only on some very sharp turns would he symbolically step on the brakes, and the car drifted through the turns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It showed the ultimate speed and passion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, Melina's heart was pounding. She thought this way of driving was extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes she felt like it was about to crash, but thanks to Marcus' superb driving skills, it never happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the car's speed reached 220 miles per hour. There was a sharp turn ahead. Marcus slightly stepped on the brake and the car made a very beautiful motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned around at a speed of 180 miles per hour and successfully overtook a McLaren racing car!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, this guy is crazy, why is he so fast all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The McLaren owner couldn't help but swear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Marcus' drifting, he could only curse but had no chance of catching up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his opinion, this way of driving was no different from playing with one's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, they couldn't achieve this effect even if they tried their best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus accelerated at full throttle and soon reached a speed of 260 miles per hour, which was almost the same speed as the Pagani driven by Edison in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pagani's speed jumped between 180 and 260 mph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus' speed was still increasing. As the number of bends increased, his speed did not decrease but became faster and faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Melina couldn't help but close her eyes and remind Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, can you drive slower? I'm so scared..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "I told you to sit well. This is just the beginning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished speaking, Marcus accelerated at full throttle again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed directly exceeded 280 miles, and there was a 600-foot-long straight line in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy released by the 3.9t engine and the electric motor directly made the speed of this car exceed 300 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Park, that guy caught up with us!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
