  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil quickly asked, "Mr. Zack, what should we do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom sneered, "For someone like him, a sorcerer of his kind, we must take him down. Ideally, burn him alive so he can no longer harm the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon smirked and added, "Mr. Zack is right. I've always thought there was something off about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he possibly cure Sir Thurman's severe illness in such a short time? He must have used some kind of sorcery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil fully believed what Tom and Landon were saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately signaled the bodyguards to seize Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the bodyguards surrounded Marcus. The air grew tense and hostile as if a battle could erupt at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's face darkened when she saw this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She positioned herself in front of Marcus and declared, "Marcus cured my grandfather. You're spouting nonsense. As long as I'm here, I won't let anyone lay a finger on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Cloe sneered, "Melina, Mr. Zack wouldn't lie to us. Your boyfriend could really be a sorcerer. And yet you're still protecting him? Are you planning to go against our family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari tugged at Melina's sleeve, trying to persuade her. She said, "Melina, we should stay out of this. Let your uncle and Mr. Zack handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, however, shook her head firmly and said to her, "Mom, Marcus is my boyfriend. Even if he truly is a sorcerer, I'll stand by him. I won't let anyone hurt him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before her words settled, Davey slapped her across the face and said coldly, "Get over here right now! If you dare to side with an outsider again, I'll disown you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina clutched her reddened cheek, her eyes filled with grievance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom, pleased to see the situation under his control, wore a smug expression. He said, "Mr. Davey Thurman, I suggest you apprehend this sorcerer immediately. Otherwise, he might bring disaster to your family's fortune!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Tom with an expression full of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze sent a chill down Tom's spine, prompting him to demand. "Boy, what are you laughing at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "I'm laughing at how close you are to death, yet you remain oblivious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking nonsense!" Tom bellowed, his face turning livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The backlash will fully manifest within a minute. Your life is already counting down, yet you still dare to spout nonsense. I admire your bravery!" Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom's expression darkened further. The precision with which Marcus had previously identified his symptoms now weighed on him. His voice turned shrill and desperate as he shouted, "You're lying! You're absolutely lying! My body is in perfect condition. There's no such thing as a curse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no sooner had he finished speaking than a sharp pain erupted in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, an overwhelming backlash of energy surged within him, enveloping his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom let out a piercing scream, his body collapsing backward onto the floor. Blood spurted from his mouth as his face turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sight stunned everyone. Their eyes were filled with horror and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The backlash... There really is backlash in my body. How... How did you know? Who... Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom lay sprawled on the ground, staring at Marcus with sheer incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never could have imagined that Marcus had seen through everything and even predicted the exact moment his backlash would erupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such precision was something even the head of the Celestial Arc Order couldn't achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't spare Tom another glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had warned him earlier, but he refused to listen. His current predicament was a consequence of his own arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... Can you save me? I was wrong, truly wrong. I beg you, save my life!" Tom pleaded, his voice trembling with desperation and his eyes filling with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this was his final chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Marcus' help, he was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you live or die has nothing to do with me. I warned you, and that was already a kindness. You chose not to value it, so who can you blame?" Marcus said coldly and didn't look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Thurman family, including Landon, was utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could hardly believe Marcus had accurately predicted Tom's demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Bowden awoke from his coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was filled with a mixture of astonishment and joy when he saw them in front of him. "I... Am I alive? It's so good to see you all again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his voice, the family turned to face him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina said, "Do you see now? Grandpa has woken up! And yet you believed that fraud's lies earlier. Don't you feel embarrassed now?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
