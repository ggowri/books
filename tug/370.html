  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Officer Burnett, I don't understand why Mr. Wilde sent such a person to participate in the task. Isn't he afraid of affecting others?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another person echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver glanced at the two men and looked cold, saying, "Mind your own business. Just do your job well. If my prediction is correct, the people of the Black Hawk Legion should appear within half an hour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Oliver's words, the two men no longer spoke but looked at Marcus' eyes with irony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver also inadvertently glanced at Marcus, but said nothing, and soon withdrew his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, in his view, people like Marcus were not worth too much attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear what Oliver said? His prediction has always been very accurate. Hurry and put on your equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you don't like to take part in this kind of task. I won't look for you again, okay? Let's finish this first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued talking to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was not a police officer and had no sense of responsibility and professionalism that a police officer should have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Maxine also knew that she was still asking too much of Marcus</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus was an ordinary person, and couldn't be judged according to the standard of an officer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can kill the enemy without wearing these things, and the first batch of people from the Black Hawk Legion can't be their main force. Why are you in a hurry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine sighed and was too lazy to talk to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she listened carefully to the information in the walkie-talkie, some of which came from other teams and some from their intelligence personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was of great help to this mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by mastering this information could they be in an invincible position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence once again made the other members dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who did this guy think he was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was obviously questioning Oliver's previous judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he think he could predict more accurately than Oliver?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, everyone was more willing to believe Oliver's prediction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, in less than half an hour, the news came from the intelligence group, saying that the people of the Black Hawk Legion had come!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were rapidly moving in the direction of the information database.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And many people were coming. They were well-equipped and well-trained. At first glance, they were battle-hardened people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, everyone was shocked and impressed by Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prediction of Oliver was simply more accurate than the observation of the people in the information group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See? These people are wearing heavy equipment, and all of them are well-trained. You told me that they are not the main force of the Black Hawk Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I even doubt that Abel and Josiah are among them. You are a layman. Learn well in the future. Don't question the judgment of the Lord of War. When the Lord of War went to the battlefield, you were still ignorant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, a member of the Kingston Special Brigade came to the front of Marcus, holding a military telescope, and spoke sarcastically to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered and said, "The Black Hawk Legion is a world-renowned mercenary army. This time, it secretly sneaked into Uswad. There must be some other forces of them. If you believe this is their main force, you are too superficial. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, the members of the Kingston Special Police Brigade frowned and said, "Then tell me where their main force is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually said, "The main force hasn't appeared yet. Once it does, I will explore it as soon as possible and inform you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence made the others stunned and even attracted the attention of Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is talking nonsense. It sounds like he can find the main force of the Black Hawk Legion. It's overreaching!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just take it as a joke. Do you believe him? With the God of War here, even if the person who comes at this moment is not the main force, the God of War can also discover it immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored the comments and taunts of these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unloaded his equipment, looked lazy, and leaned in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, his divine knowledge was always released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything around him was under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus' body never moved, as long as someone entered the area covered by God's knowledge, he could find out and control all the information of the other party!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, hundreds of well-trained members of the Black Hawk Legion wearing heavy weapons arrived at the periphery of the information database.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers who had been waiting for him for hours were already impatient and attacked the members of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, gunshots were heard everywhere, and the flames were soaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People of the Black Hawk Legion were caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were from a top mercenary organization, so they quickly adjusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a very high combat state, many SWAT officers launched a counterattack, and an extremely fierce urban street fighting broke out!</span></p><div class="pagination">
