  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's body quivered, and her mind instantly went blank. That intense feeling of comfort was so overwhelming that it made her feel as if she were in a fairyland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a while before Catherine came to her senses from that feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face still retained a rosy flush, and beads of sweat were trickling down her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You feel good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked. He had always been extremely attentive to the feelings of his bedmates, constantly trying to ensure that each encounter enabled them to enjoy the most perfect happiness fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine gently bit her lips and nodded slightly, and a shy expression gradually appeared on her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, why would you say that? You don't seem the least bit shy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've already done what we needed to do. What is there to be shy about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, through successive dual cultivation sessions with Lila, Josie, Melina, Natalia, and Catherine herself, Marcus' cultivation had been steadily improving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular dual cultivation enabled his cultivation to gradually step beyond the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, Catherine's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her mother, Laura, calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Mom. I'm downstairs, and I'll be up in a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, you sound a bit out of breath. Are you tired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura asked, her voice full of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, Mom. Don't worry. I'm truly alright... I just took a short jog a while ago, so I'm a bit breathless. I'll be upstairs soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Laura's words, Catherine's pretty face suddenly flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she glared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Catherine told Marcus, "Marcus, it's all your fault. My mom said I was a bit out of breath... It's so embarrassing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Catherine got out of the car and trotted upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, take the car keys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly stepped forward, handed the car keys to Catherine, and left with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Catherine drove a </span><span>brand new</span><span> mini car to work. Even though her driving skills were not quite good, this car was easier to control than she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving at the company, she immediately attracted envious glances from many female colleagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, you're also early. Which department are you in? After I get familiar with the environment, I'll talk to the boss tomorrow and see if I can help you get a better position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had Catherine stepped out of the car than she caught sight of Gina approaching her from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine greeted her with a smile and said, "Gina, I work in the general manager's office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina was taken aback for a moment. After a short pause, she glanced at Catherine thoughtfully and said, "Catherine, you're truly remarkable. I didn't expect you to be the general manager's secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. You're not only highly educated but also stunning. It's no wonder the general manager has taken a liking to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine simply smiled without saying anything and entered the office building with Gina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her office was located on the eighty-eighth floor, and she had an exclusive elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they reached the elevator door, Catherine said goodbye to Gina, "Gina, I'm heading up first. See you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, go ahead. I have to go through the onboarding process, so I probably won't see you until this afternoon," Gina replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the two went their separate ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Gina's first day at work, and there were numerous procedures she needed to follow, such as filling out forms and being assigned an office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, her employment application form required the signature of the company's general manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Gina had filled in the form, a female staff member from the Human Resources Department informed her, "Ms. Gina Wilson, take this form to the </span><span>general manager's</span><span> office on the eighty-eighth floor. Once Ms. Wilson signs it, you can officially commence work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Wilson? Does the general manager also bear the surname Wilson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, the general manager is quite pretty, and you'll find out when you see her. Anyway, I believe our general manager is the most gorgeous woman in the entire </span><span>company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what, Ms. Gina Wilson, you look a bit like her," The female staff member added with a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina didn't pay much attention to this comment, merely taking it as a courteous compliment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly thereafter, Gina made her way nervously to the </span><span>general manager's</span><span> office on the eighty-eighth floor and knocked on the heavy and armored double doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sweet voice came from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina pushed the door open and walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The office spanned an area of two thousand square feet, looking magnificent and capacious. Through the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows, they could take in the entire vista of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina couldn't help but exclaim inwardly, "Is this the general manager's office? It's truly splendid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze then shifted and fell on a large desk not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar person was sitting in front of the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, why are you sitting there? Where is the general manager? Hurry up and get away. Be careful not to be saw by the general manager later," Gina reminded Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they had first seen each other just now, Gina had mistaken Catherine for the general manager's secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her estimation, although Catherine was a secretary, it was improper for her to be seated at the general manager's desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, this is my desk. You're here to handle the entry procedures, right? Bring it over, and I'll sign for you," Catherine said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina raised her eyebrows slightly and responded with a smile, "Catherine, cut it out. How could you possibly be the general manager?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
