  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your turn now." Marcus' gaze swept across Terry and the other members of the Griffin family, and his words carried a chilling and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry and his men visibly trembled. Their faces were drained of color as fear overtook them. "Please, this is all a misunderstanding," Terry stammered, "The Griffin family has no intention of opposing you. Spare us, I beg of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold laugh. "No intention of opposing me? And yet you sent assassins after me in secret. The thing I despise most is hypocrisy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his finger tightened on the trigger. A beam of destructive energy shot forth from the gun, obliterating Terry in an instant. His body was blown apart in a flash of despair, marking the end of the Griffin family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gruesome scene sent shivers down the spines of the remaining Griffin family members. Fear and the shadow of death consumed their minds, leaving no room for grief over their leader's demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting words, Marcus leveled his weapon at Zane and Easton. Easton, who moments earlier had been filled with arrogance, dropped to his knees before Marcus. "Please, spare me," Easton pleaded, and his voice quivered. "I didn't mean to offend you. I was only acting under pressure&mdash;have mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Easton groveling so disgracefully, Zane's eyes flickered with icy contempt. "This man killed your father," Zane spat, and his voice was cold and unforgiving. "And yet you kneel before him, begging for your life? You've tarnished the pride of the Griffin family and disgraced the honor of Crankhurstians. Today, I'll rid the family of this shame myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Zane drew a katana. Its blade gleamed coldly, and slashed toward Easton without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Easton seemed prepared. He dodged swiftly, pulling out his own katana in response. His face twisted in fury as he roared, "All I wanted was a chance to survive&mdash;what's so wrong about that? Since you want me dead, I won't let you live either." With that, Easton swung his blade toward Zane, and the two clashed in a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the scene unfold, Marcus couldn't help but smirk. "Now," he said, and his tone was laced with sarcasm, "this is what I call a classic case of self-destruction." He didn't intervene, standing idly by as Zane and Easton turned on each other in a brutal fight to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Zane's superior skill won out. With one swift thrust, his blade pierced Easton's heart, ending the younger man's life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining members of the Griffin family watched in horror, and their faces were ashen. None of them had imagined their family would descend into such brutal infighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with death, people often lost their reason, doing things they might never have thought possible. Such was human nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're next," Zane roared, and his eyes blazed with fury as he charged Marcus. Katana was raised high. Marcus simply raised his weapon, pulling the trigger. With a deafening explosion, Zane's body was obliterated, leaving nothing but charred remnants behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Griffin family members, trembling with terror, tried to flee. These were the same people who had participated in plotting against Marcus. Marcus showed no mercy. Raising his compact sub-machine gun, he mowed them down in a hail of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In under a minute, the Griffin family's upper echelon lay dead, and their blood soaked the ground. Marcus was no bloodthirsty demon. All he had done was mete out justice to those who had brought this upon themselves. As for the innocent women and children of the family, Marcus spared them, turning on his heel and leaving the Griffin Villa without a backward glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Black Dragon Society Headquarters, the president of Black Dragon Society, Alexander Walker, was furious. He had already mobilized their top fighters to hunt down Marcus in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could act, a lone figure appeared in the grand hall of the headquarters. The high-ranking members of Black Dragon Society turned their attention to the intruder, and their expressions darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you... the one who killed our ninjas," someone exclaimed, immediately recognizing Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a derisive laugh. "If your people hadn't come after me, we could've let bygones be bygones. But since you've chosen death, don't blame me for showing no mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander studied Marcus intently, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "You have guts, I'll give you that. But barging into my headquarters? You've signed your own death warrant. I'll make sure you regret those arrogant words." As he spoke, the overwhelming aura of a Stage Six ninja radiated from the president, suffocating the air around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Stage Six ninja&mdash;an unrivaled master in Crankhurst. But to Marcus, it was barely worth noticing. Simultaneously, several Stage Five members of Black Dragon Society sprang into action. Among them were two elderly Stage Six ninjas, and their combined power was formidable enough to rival any elite force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding Blade Ray slashed toward Marcus, its speed and destructive force enough to make the air ripple. Marcus didn't flinch. With a smirk, he raised his fist and punched forward. A Fist Ray tore through the air, obliterating the Blade Ray in an instant. The shockwave hit one of the Stage Five ninjas, reducing him to a bloody mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden display of overwhelming power froze the other ninjas in their tracks, disbelief written all over their faces. None of them had expected Marcus to be this terrifyingly strong.</span></p><div class="pagination">
