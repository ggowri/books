  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Mr. Whitby," Louise sneered, her voice dripping with sarcasm, "am I right or what? He's nothing but a worthless gold digger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Jonathan snapped, his harsh tone making everyone flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Jonathan walked up to Marcus, lit his cigarette with exaggerated deference, and began kissing up to him. "I deeply apologize for my poor judgment in not recognizing you earlier, Mr. Fitzgerald. Head office specifically instructed me to treat you with the utmost respect. Whatever you need, just name it! I'm at your service!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent Louise's family into a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never in their wildest dreams had they imagined Marcus was the Mr. Fitzgerald Jonathan had mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by Jonathan's complete change in attitude, Marcus clearly wasn't the nobody they'd assumed him to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, someone who commanded respect from Solomia Construction couldn't possibly be just some gold-digging loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus crossed his legs, shooting Paul a cold glance. "He works under you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire him. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words cut like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's expression turned sullen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His recent success had been entirely dependent on Jonathan throwing contracts his way through his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting fired would leave him with absolutely nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, don't you dare go too far! I set your sister up with Mr. Whitby thinking about your family's interests, and now you're cutting off my livelihood? I swear on my life, I'll make you pay for this!" Paul snarled at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise started throwing a fit, wailing and screaming, "Oh, Melinda, look at this ungrateful son you've raised! He's nothing but a snake in the grass! We're blood relatives, for God's sake! Even if Paul made some mistakes, there's no need to go nuclear on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your whole family is ruthless! Your big sister has always looked out for you all these years, and this is how you repay her kindness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel stood up, leaning on his cane, and jabbed a finger at Melinda. "Listen here, Melinda, this little beast is an ungrateful brat! Now that he's got some success, instead of helping family and friends, he's destroying their livelihoods! If you don't stop him, you're no daughter of mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Melinda felt guilty and tugged at Marcus's arm. "Marcus, honey, we're all family here. Teaching Paul a lesson is one thing, but don't take it too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took his mother's hand, speaking calmly. "Mom, can't you see it yet? You treat them like family, but they don't even treat you like a human being. That's exactly why they need to learn their lesson today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Melinda tried to speak again, Richard shook his head at her, signaling her to stay out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's demands put Jonathan in a tough spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he lacked the authority to fire Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real issue was their financial entanglement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By subcontracting work to Paul, he was pocketing a sixty percent kickback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was basically free money in his pocket!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he fired Paul, that cash flow would dry up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Mr. Fitzgerald," Jonathan said, mustering his courage. "Paul's doing a fine job. I have no right to fire him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul shot Jonathan a grateful look at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold laugh, seeing right through Jonathan's little game. "And what if I insist?" he asked, his voice dripping with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan's expression darkened, and he let out a bitter chuckle. "Sure, head office told me to play nice with you, but don't let it go to your head. You're just another business contact, nothing more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've seen plenty like you," he continued, his voice dripping with disdain. "You climb a little way up the ladder and think you're a big shot. Well, today I'm not listening to you. Go ahead and complain to whoever you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Marcus's behavior, Jonathan was convinced he couldn't possibly be anyone important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This conclusion came partly from Marcus's age and partly from what he knew about Marcus's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, what could the son of ordinary farmers amount to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was probably just some minor official in one of their partner companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Jonathan finished speaking, Louise's family couldn't hide their smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus really thought he was hot stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nerve of him, trying to order Jonathan around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, Jonathan really put that worthless gold digger in his place! That was so satisfying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better remember what you just said!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just smiled lazily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Jonathan hadn't directly offended him, Marcus wasn't about to let him off the hook, not after seeing that predatory look he'd given Nicole when he walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's it matter what I said? I'm a project manager at Solomia Construction. You can't even imagine the connections I have in this industry. Forget about you! Even some bigshots in the company would have a hard time touching me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan boasted with a smug look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't spent all these years in the construction business for nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to see what this punk could do to him!</span></p><div class="pagination">
