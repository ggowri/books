  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stanley, don't pin this on Marcus. If you've got a problem, take it up with me!" Chloe said, stepping forward to shield Marcus with her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's eyes flashed with a sharp glint. He grit his teeth and spat, "Chloe, you're still defending this outsider? What a letdown&mdash;siding with him over your own family. You're breaking my heart here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stanley, don't listen to her," Everett cut in. "This jerk didn't just hit me&mdash;he's keeping Chloe from handing over cash. No money, no product. How am I supposed to buy from you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That little rant gave Marcus a fresh nugget of info. Everett's drugs were coming straight from Stanley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Stanley was Serpent's Coil. This meant someone higher up in Serpent's Coil was likely dealing under the table, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's face darkened, a cold smirk twisting his lips. "You've got some guts, punk. I don't care what you're up to with this chick, but if you're cutting off Everett's cash&mdash;and our profits&mdash;you're asking for trouble. If I don't make an example out of you today, I'm done in Solomia's underground."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved a hand, and the Serpent's Coil goons behind him surged forward, ready to throw down there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised a hand, casual as ever. "You wanna fight? Not enough room here. Let's take it downstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley and his crew perked up, intrigued. "Big talk for a guy who's out of his league," Stanley sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think a bigger space changes anything? Fine&mdash;makes it easier to beat you until your own mom wouldn't recognize you." He motioned to his guys, and they piled into the elevator, heading down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett shot Marcus an icy glare. "Don't even think about bailing. With your little tricks, Stanley would track you down in a heartbeat. Run, and it'll be way uglier than if you face it." With that, he stormed off after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're seriously going down there to fight them?" Chloe asked, worry creeping into her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you&mdash;this ends today," Marcus said. "It's not just about you anymore. I've got my own stake in this." He stepped into the next elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe frowned, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mess started because of her&mdash;so why was Marcus acting like it was personal for him, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity tugged at her, but there was no time to dwell. She hopped in after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Downstairs, Stanley, Everett, and the crew were waiting. When Marcus strolled out of the building, smirks curled their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, damn, you actually showed," Stanley said. "So, how's this gonna go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you waiting for us to jump you, or you wanna kneel and slap yourself silly? Maybe chop off a finger to say sorry? Your call, pal&mdash;I'm not wasting breath on trash like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley smirked coldly, his face darkening like Marcus was already dead meat in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't bite. Instead, he stared them down, voice like steel. "You're Serpent's Coil. Don't you know the rules? No dealing drugs, no using&mdash;none of that crap in the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's your boss? Does he know what you're pulling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew something was rotten in Serpent's Coil. Grunts like these wouldn't dare break the code unless someone upstairs was green-lighting them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's eyes narrowed, his smug mask slipping. "Who the hell are you to poke into Serpent's Coil's business?" he snarled. "Even if I'm bending the rules, what's it to you? Some nobody from the sticks&mdash;you really think you're hot stuff?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his guys stepped up, cracking his knuckles. "Stanley, this punk's got a mouth on him. Let me shut it&mdash;bash his face in for meddling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley nodded, his gaze dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no clue how Marcus knew Serpent's Coil's code, but it didn't matter. This guy was toast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Country boy, you've got a big mouth for someone about to eat pavement," the goon barked, lunging forward with a wild swing at Marcus' face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caught his wrist mid-air, twisted, and slammed a foot into the guy's gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud. The dude hit the ground with a scream, curling up like a shrimp on a grill, his face ghost-white as he wailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley and the rest froze, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't seen that coming&mdash;Marcus laying out one of their own like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's eyes flared with murder. "You little shit, you dare touch my crew? Slapping yourself or losing a finger isn't cutting it anymore. You're spending the rest of your life in a wheelchair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved at the others. "Get him&mdash;mess him up bad. Kill him if you have to, I'll clean it up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The goons didn't hesitate. These were street-hardened thugs, and with Stanley's green light, they came at Marcus like rabid dogs, every move aimed to end him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch. His fists lit up with a terrifying glow, slamming into them one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against a Return Essence stage expert&mdash;Acquired Return Essence Realm, Fifth Stage&mdash;no street punk stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang, bang, bang. In less than a minute, they were all down, groaning and clutching broken ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe, Stanley, and Everett gaped, floored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe had seen Marcus scrap before, but she'd been too rattled to clock it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now? She couldn't peel her eyes off him&mdash;his raw power was unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley and Everett hadn't pegged this quiet guy for a beast. No wonder he'd strolled out so cool-headed against a whole crew. He had the goods to back it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Stanley wasn't fazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a mid-tier shot-caller in Serpent's Coil, and lately, he'd been training with the magic manual Marcus had handed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't a Wizard yet, but the practice had juiced him up&mdash;way more jacked than the average.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So even with Marcus showing off, Stanley still figured he could take him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, chest puffed out. "Not bad, punk. You can throw a punch&mdash;I'll give you that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't get cocky just because you dropped a few scrubs. Against me? You're still out of your league."</span></p><div class="pagination">
