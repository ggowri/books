  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baron, you're finally here! That guy attacked our men, acting all high and mighty. He even said he'd wait for you to settle this together!" the one-eyed man spoke coldly, adding dramatic exaggerations to stoke the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baron adjusted his flashy, multi-colored hair with a cocky expression. "In this neighborhood, no one dares disrespect me, Baron! Let's see which fool is bold enough to cross me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's him, Baron! Take him down!" the one-eyed man barked, pointing at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing nearby, Walter chimed in. "Baron, deal with this guy for me, and I'll make sure you're properly rewarded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baron's gaze shifted to Marcus, scrutinizing him carefully. A flicker of recognition crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his phone, quickly glancing at a chat with Edgar and suddenly pieced things together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Baron stood motionless, the one-eyed man impatiently urged. "Baron, why haven't you made a move yet? Don't let that guy make a mockery of our Axe Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your damn mouth, you talk too much!" Baron snapped, backhanding the one-eyed man across the face. The one-eyed man stood there stunned, utterly confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baron, why'd you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the one-eyed man, Baron strode toward Marcus with a flattering smile. "May I ask, sir, are you the Marcus Fitzgerald from Solomia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baron immediately bowed deeply before Marcus, his demeanor as respectful as it could get. "Baron has heard of you for a long time, Mr. Fitzgerald. If there has been any offense, please accept my sincerest apologies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter and the one-eyed man were frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy's just some small-town nobody from Solomia&mdash;how could he command Baron's respect like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Josie Shelman, who had been worried Marcus might suffer under Baron's hand, widened her eyes in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Marcus to be someone even Baron would bow to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've often heard your name mentioned by Edgar," Marcus remarked, still seated. "Impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baron didn't feel the slightest bit embarrassed. Maintaining his respectful demeanor, he said earnestly, "My mentor owes much of his success to you, Mr. Fitzgerald, and I've benefited greatly from his guidance. He often spoke of you as a true titan of our world&mdash;a role model for those of us in the underworld. He made it clear that if I ever had the honor of meeting you, I must treat you with the utmost respect. Even though I've made a name for myself here in Kingston, I've never forgotten the lessons and support my mentor gave me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that before Edgar joined the Serpent's Coil, he had been a legend in Kingston's underworld, nicknamed the Seven Stars Slayer for his unparalleled feats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Baron had been a lowly enforcer, mentored and guided by Edgar into the position he held today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Baron continued, "Walter is associated with the Brown family of Kingston. I'll remain neutral in this matter. Whatever happens between you two is your business. I'll take my men and leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Baron signaled the members of the Axe Gang to withdraw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the Brown family's vast influence, it made sense for Baron to avoid direct conflict with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't about to force the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Baron's group departed, Walter broke out in a cold sweat and quietly tried to slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice froze Walter in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly turning around, Walter forced a weak smile. "Baron's neutrality should settle this, right? What more do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rose from his seat, taking slow, deliberate steps toward Walter. Cornered against a wall, Walter's composure crumbled. "Baron's neutrality doesn't mean our issue is resolved," Marcus said coolly. "Didn't you want to break my limbs? I happen to be a firm believer in an eye for an eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled a sleek dagger from his belt and twirled it in his hand, letting the blade glint menacingly under the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's face drained of color as he stammered. "I-I am sorry! I really messed up! Mr. Fitzgerald, I didn't recognize your status. Please, spare me this once! I was just joking earlier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joking?" Marcus let out a cold laugh. "If I didn't have strength or Baron's recognition, what do you think would've happened to me? Do you think a simple 'joke' would've saved you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have two options: let me do it, or you take care of it yourself&mdash;sever your own tendons."</span></p><div class="pagination">
