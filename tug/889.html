  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she also craved being a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Maxine was extremely delighted that she had unexpectedly become a warrior by some strange twist of fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked Marcus curiously, "Why is it that having sex with you makes you a warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "Because my Dual Cultivation has the effect of enhancing both parties' cultivation. The two times of Dual Cultivation you had with me have led to my cultivation improving as well. It's not surprising that you have become a warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, can I become as powerful as you in the future?" Maxine asked expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her understanding still held that Marcus' cultivation level was only at the Ancient Martial Stage four or five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Maxine, this was already quite impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could reach that level, she would undoubtedly be extremely content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you are willing to make more efforts in self-cultivation, especially by engaging in Dual Cultivation with me more frequently, it won't be difficult for you to reach my level of strength," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On hearing this, Maxine's pretty face immediately turned red. For a moment, she didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, come out and face your doom!" However, just at this moment, a voice came from nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was not loud, but it reverberated in Marcus' eardrums as if it had been uttered right beside his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus furrowed his brow slightly. Addressing Maxine, he said, "Don't be afraid. Stay here and don't move. I'll go out and have a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she too heard that voice, Maxine nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got dressed and got out of the car. Looking in the direction where the sound came from, he saw two figures emerging from the void and then landing right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two individuals seemed to be in their forties or fifties, but they exuded an extremely powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon careful observation, it could be found that their cultivation levels had all reached the stage of Return Essence. Moreover, their cultivation levels were all above the Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Two. When combined together, their strength was extremely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, both of these two individuals were warriors with Oriana Land's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that they all came from the world of Ancient Martial Art in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. That was to say, these two individuals were very likely to be those legendary ancient freaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world of Ancient Martial Art in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, there had always been a widespread legend about some ancient monsters who had remained secluded from the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rumors, these people's cultivation was very likely to have already surpassed the Foundation Establishment Stage and approached the level of the Return Essence stage. Judging from the current situation, this rumor seemed to be largely true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also the first time that Marcus truly got in touch with the world of Ancient Martial Arts in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, reaching the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was not daring to be presumptuous. He glanced at them and asked, "Who are you? Why do you keep insisting on taking my life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know these two at all. Judging from the aura they exuded, these two seemed not to belong to any school or sect that he had ever come into contact with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who we are is none of your business. Just hand over all the Return Essence Crystals, and then commit suicide to apologize," said one middle-aged man in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze towards Marcus was filled with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of me handing over the Return Essence Crystal if I have to kill myself after that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what the middle-aged man said, Marcus was almost about to burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that although this person appeared to be of middle-aged appearance on the surface, in fact, he was definitely much older than that. He was most likely an old monster who had lived for countless years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't hand over the Return Essence Crystal, both of us will tear you to pieces. This will be much more brutal than you do it yourself. </span><span>So</span><span> you'd better think things through carefully. We two don't want to attack you easily because others will say that we bully the weak. Do you understand?" The middle-aged man continued, seemingly not taking Marcus into account at all as if they could easily take Marcus' life just by making a move.</span></p><div class="pagination">
