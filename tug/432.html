  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cried out again, her body convulsing as Marcus pounded into her with increasing intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The secret passage within her tightened, and a wave of heat enveloped Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling her flood wash over him, Marcus thrust harder and faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, I'm so full... Please stop... I can't take it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the very beginning, Diana had been begging him to stop, her body trembling as if electrified by his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost simultaneously, the power of Marcus' Dual Cultivation activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this enhanced energy, their sensations intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A strange force pulsed through them, bringing Diana an unprecedented level of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tingling sensation where their bodies met became even more intense, as if their souls were merging with each other. With each thrust, she found release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus... What is this... It feels so good... I don't want to stop... Can you go harder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Overwhelmed by pleasure, Diana's voice was filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite her initial embarrassment, she was now completely lost in the moment, craving more of Marcus' intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's because of my Dual Cultivation. When we make love, we both experience a heightened sense of pleasure and receive significant benefits," Marcus explained as he thrust even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dual Cultivation, Marcus? When did you learn about Dual Cultivation?" Diana asked, her blue eyes sparkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry about that. Just focus on the feeling," Marcus replied, his voice laced with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their movements became more frenzied, the power of the Dual Cultivation surged through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of intense energy flowed from their joined bodies, enveloping Marcus in a warm, tingling sensation. His blood raced through his veins, carrying this energy to every corner of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the wave of pleasure intensified, the energy within him grew stronger, filling him with an almost limitless vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His desire reached its peak, and he began to experiment with different positions, relentlessly attacking Diana's pleasure zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah... Oh... Mm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's body convulsed as she experienced wave after wave of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The powerful energy coursed through her, warming her from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every inch of her skin and every organ throbbed with sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, with a series of powerful thrusts, Diana reached her fourth climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Marcus found his own release, his body convulsing as he poured his essence deep within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An intense surge of energy washed over Marcus, causing his body to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his release, he broke through to the next level of Ancient Martial Art, reaching Stage Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Overwhelmed by the intensity of the experience, Marcus collapsed onto Diana, panting heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was also in a daze, her mind blank. The overwhelming pleasure had transported her to another world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she finally came to her senses, she realized that her Wizard level had increased!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been stuck at this level for almost a year, but one session of Dual Cultivation with Marcus had broken through her plateau.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was both exhilarated and amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How do you feel?" Marcus asked, looking at her flushed face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was equally astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected that one session of Dual Cultivation with Diana would help him break through to the next level of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's a known fact that the higher one ascends in Ancient Martial Arts, the more difficult it becomes to break through to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had expected to see minimal progress in the next two months, but this was an unexpected breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He realized that Diana's higher cultivation level had played a significant role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The higher the cultivation level of his partner in Dual Cultivation, the greater the benefits he would reap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could see this clearly from his previous experience with Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they had practiced Dual Cultivation, he had helped her reach Ancient Martial Art Stage One, but his own progress had been minimal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, a single session of Dual Cultivation with Diana had propelled him to the next level, proving his theory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It feels wonderful," Diana admitted, her cheeks flushed. "And the best part is, my Wizard level have increased."</span></p><div class="pagination">
