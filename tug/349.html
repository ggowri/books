  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine stood there, her heart pounding like a drum, as if she were caught in a waking dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a little while ago, she had been losing sleep over job hunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was suddenly the General Manager of Sync Group's Solomia branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Catherine, the woman she had always looked down on, take the position of General Manager, Gloria's face twisted with despair and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in high school, Gloria had always thought of herself as the queen bee, the one everyone admired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never saw Catherine as anything but ordinary, someone easy to mock and overshadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even years later, when they reconnected, Gloria still believed she was leagues ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her uncle holding a high-ranking position at Sync Group, Gloria was confident she could use his influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she could easily push Catherine out and land herself a managerial job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a move most people could only dream of pulling off, and she had been certain of her success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all of that fell apart because Catherine knew Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria's uncle lost his job, got arrested, and Gloria's chance at Sync Group vanished in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the woman she had mocked? Catherine had taken her uncle's seat at the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria's thoughts spiraled as the humiliation and helplessness consumed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, the crowd was equally stunned, struggling to process what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria had spent the entire time flaunting her "connections" and trying to intimidate Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this? This was real influence&mdash;no contest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine didn't just get a foot in the door; she went straight to the top. Who could even compete with that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of it was because of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone was the true game-changer, it was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the assistant branch manager's guidance, Marcus escorted Catherine into the Solomia headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them took a tour of the facilities and offices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a newly established branch, everything was cutting-edge and designed for maximum efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Cedars Villas feel ancient in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's General Manager office was on the 88th floor, the very top of the skyscraper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the massive floor-to-ceiling windows, she had a panoramic view of Solomia's skyline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing there, her pulse quickened with excitement and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never in her wildest dreams thought she'd rise to such heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... thank you," she murmured, her voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the assistant manager and staff had left, only Catherine and Marcus remained in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine tilted her head up at Marcus, her eyes sparkling with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time and again, Marcus had pulled off the impossible in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Catherine, Marcus wasn't just a man&mdash;he was like a knight in shining armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever she was backed into a corner, he showed up and turned the tide, every single time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank me? For what? This is all you. You earned it," Marcus said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze lingered on Catherine's face, her sweet and pure expression lighting up the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine had a charm that was understated yet irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't icy like Maxine Burnett, commanding like Josie Shelman, or bold like Jane Winchester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her softness and sincerity struck a chord that Marcus couldn't ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Catherine's phone rang, snapping her out of her thoughts&mdash;it was her mom, Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom! I got the job! I'm the General Manager now. Mr. Fitzgerald arranged everything for me!" Catherine blurted out, sharing her excitement with her mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's amazing news, sweetheart! Make sure you thank Marcus properly. He's done so much for us&mdash;don't forget, he's the one who saved my life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And tonight, you better bring Marcus home. I'll cook up something special for both of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's voice was filled with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's gratitude for Marcus was immeasurable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also secretly hoped that her daughter's relationship with Marcus might grow into something more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura had seen how Catherine looked at him, though her shy daughter would never admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mother, she had been quietly thinking of ways to help bring the two closer together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Mom! Leave it to me!" Catherine said, patting her chest with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, she turned to Marcus with a hopeful expression. "Mr. Fitzgerald, my mom wants to cook for us tonight. I already said yes. Will you come over for dinner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus blinked, about to politely decline, but Catherine grabbed his arm, her voice soft and pleading. "Mr. Fitzgerald, if you don't say no, I'm taking that as a yes. And if you don't come, I'll have no way to explain it to my mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with her wide, earnest eyes, Marcus couldn't bring himself to say no. "Alright, I'll come," he finally agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two spent a bit more time going over operations at the branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By 3:00 PM, they left the building and headed to Catherine's apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By 3:30, they arrived at her home, where Laura had already prepared a feast that filled the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's father, Philip, was also there. Since Marcus' last visit, Philip had given up gambling and cut back significantly on drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a relief to both Catherine and Laura, a silver lining they both cherished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, the dinner wrapped up in a cheerful and warm atmosphere, and Catherine walked Marcus to the door.</span></p><div class="pagination">
