  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were utterly stunned, almost wondering if they were seeing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen, the newly appointed president of Sync Group, had just bowed to the young man in front of everyone, addressing him with the utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius, Jake, and Abigail were completely taken aback, their minds racing with questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was this happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Stephen and asked, "Is this guy your nephew?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen was sweating profusely. "Yes. He's young and foolish, and he offended you. Mr. Fitzgerald, please forgive him just this once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scoffed. "He wanted to break my legs and cut out my tongue. How can I simply let that go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen wiped his brow, his expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Abigail stepped forward. "Mr. Stephen Andrade, he's my ex-husband. He was the chairman of Golden Group, but he was kicked out a long time ago. Don't be fooled by him; he's just someone else's pawn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen kicked Abigail in the stomach. "Shut up, bitch! Who do you think you are? Get her out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two bodyguards swiftly moved in, forcibly dragging Abigail away and restraining her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Stephen Andrade, you have to believe me! This guy is just a useless freeloader. He's lying to you!" Abigail shouted desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen turned coldly to the bodyguards. "Slap her to shut her up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of slaps echoed as the bodyguards struck Abigail repeatedly, leaving her skin red and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Stephen, Abigail is my girlfriend. How could you treat her like this?" Julius questioned, appearing anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Stephen shot back, "You bastard, how dare you defend that woman? I can't believe I have such a foolish nephew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus's penetrating gaze, Stephen cracked under pressure. "Mr. Fitzgerald, since he has offended you, he must face the consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed a baseball bat from a bodyguard and kicked Julius to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crack, Julius's hand broke, and he screamed in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second swing shattered his left leg, followed by another blow that broke his right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps filled the room. They couldn't comprehend how Stephen could be so brutal to his own nephew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard how much he doted on Julius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, he had to hit his nephew out of fear of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was enough to show Marcus's noble status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius writhed in pain, his face pale, the excruciating pain causing him to tremble. Despair washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen dropped the bat on the floor, feeling heartbroken for Julius. But facing Marcus, he had to put on a respectful face again. "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you satisfied? If not, I can kill him right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the crumpled figure of Julius on the floor and replied, "Since he's your nephew, spare him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen then breathed a sigh of relief and quickly thanked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood in stunned silence. The atmosphere felt heavy and oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one word from Marcus had brought the esteemed president of Sync Group to his knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Marcus was the real power here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood up and walked over to Josie, who met his gaze with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having witnessed his strength before, she never imagined that even someone like Stephen would show him such deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but wonder if Sync Group belonged to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought only deepened her curiosity about his true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know Marcus's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she realized that anyone who crossed him wouldn't end well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Josie lost herself in thought, Marcus took her hand and led her out from behind the counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before leaving, he warned Stephen, "Keep your men under control. If this happens again, you'll be fired!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
