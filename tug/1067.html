  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia scoffed and turned to Chloe. "Chloe, Isolde's got a point. This guy's got a screw loose. He actually said he's gonna get Thorne fired. Who does he think he is? What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne shot Marcus a look like he was watching a lunatic on the loose. He let out a sharp laugh. "You? Fire me? Who the hell do you think you are? Let me make one thing crystal clear&mdash;I've got deep </span><span>connections</span><span> at SiliconWave Technologies. Even the </span><span>General Manager </span><span>wouldn't dare try to fire me. And you? You're nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe frowned, her gaze flicking to Marcus. She had no idea why he'd say something so outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is there even the slightest chance that Marcus has the power to fire Thorne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SiliconWave Technologies was a major publicly traded company in Kingston. What Chloe didn't know was that Marcus now owned it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>General Manager</span><span> might not be able to fire you, but I can. You really wanna test me? One call, and you're out," Marcus said, brushing off the stunned looks from Eulalia, Isolde, and Thorne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne blinked, and then his face appeared an even sharper grin. He turned to Chloe, shaking his head. "Unbelievable. I figured your boyfriend was just some nobody, but now I see he's actually delusional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you don't want to get involved with me, but here's the advice: If I were you, Ms. Sinclair, I'd dump this guy before he drags you </span><span>down</span><span>. You never know what a lunatic might do. One wrong move, and things could get... messy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne turned back to Marcus, amusement flickering in his eyes. "Alright, lad, you've got my attention. Let's see what you've got. Go on&mdash;make that call. I'm dying to watch you work your magic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a low chuckle. "Can't say I've met a guy this eager to get himself fired. But hey, who am I to stand in the way of your dreams?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Marcus pulled out his phone and dialed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end was the head of SiliconWave Technologies' Kingston division.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the call connected, the executive's tone turned respectful, almost deferential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't waste time on pleasantries&mdash;just asked what Marcus needed and assured him they'd handle it, no questions asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kept it simple. "Fire Thorne Winslow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The executive didn't hesitate, didn't even ask why, and just agreed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied, Marcus ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne stood there, arms crossed, watching the whole thing like it was some bad comedy skit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Marcus was just putting on a show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way in hell some random guy could just snap his fingers and make things happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne had been with SiliconWave Technologies for over a decade. His connections ran deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no chance in hell Marcus could just call someone up and have him fired. Impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, lad. You made your call. And look at me&mdash;still standing, still employed. Weren't you gonna fire me?" Thorne sneered, spreading his arms wide. "I knew you were full of it. Now, how about an explanation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely held back a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Marcus was bluffing&mdash;had to be. No way some guy from the entertainment industry had the pull to reach SiliconWave Technologies' top brass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia and Isolde exchanged looks, both smirking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia sighed and turned to Chloe. "Chloe, sweetie, I don't even know what to say to you. Just look at him! Your boyfriend's out here running his mouth like he's some big shot. Does he seriously think one phone call is enough to get Thorne fired? It's </span><span>ridiculous</span><span>."</span></p><div class="pagination">
