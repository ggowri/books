Why did you come to the southwest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail asked in a hoarse voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man and other people in the Red River Mines were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained calm and did not show any signs of disturbance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "I'm here on business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They said that you saved us.

She was so desperate that she almost chose to commit suicide several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was just over a month, the pain had changed her a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail was once a prominent figure in Solomia and the young lady of the Winchester family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her assets were not as good as those top figures, she lived a luxurious and wealthy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everything changed since Abigail cheated on Felix and divorced Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became penniless and was deserted by everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane had a passionate relationship with Marcus.

Please come back to me, okay? I'm sorry. You still love me, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you agree to me, I can sleep with you tonight. You always wanted it before, and now you can get what you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what Abigail said, Marcus showed a strange look and felt nauseous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed Abigail away and said, "I didn't expect you to still be so self-righteous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Based on what you did to me before, I could have killed you. The reason I didn't do </span><span>that was entirely because of Natalia. Understand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now in my heart, you are just Natalia's sister. We will never have anything to do with each other again in this life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail was thrown away with tears. "No, Marcus. I know you still love me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you don't want to admit it, you can't stand by, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast rainforest was full of various dangers. Abigail was afraid that she would not be able to get out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fend for yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned around and didn't look at Abigail anymore.</span></p><div class="pagination">
