  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Lila could finish her sentence, Shawn, fueled by alcohol, threw a ferocious punch in her direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was delicate and fragile; if the punch landed, the consequences would be dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Shawn's fist could connect, Marcus intervened, firmly grasping Shawn's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's eyes narrowed in surprise; he hadn't expected Marcus to get involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling against Marcus' grip, he roared, "Punk, get your damn hands off me! Do you think you can mess with my business? I'll kill you too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a switchblade appeared in Shawn's hand, and he lunged at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, now furious, kicked Shawn hard in the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn screamed as he slammed against the wall with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hitting a woman? You're not even a man," Marcus said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila, watching from behind, was taken aback. She hadn't expected Marcus to be such a good fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn wasn't much good at anything except for fighting. Lila remembered one time when some punks were hassling her, and Shawn had single-handedly taken them all </span><span>down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had left quite an impression on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just now, Marcus had taken Shawn down with a single move. It completely changed how Lila saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little punk, just you wait! I'll get you if it's the last thing I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching his stomach, Shawn staggered to his feet and cautiously backed out of the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you alright?" Lila asked Marcus with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and shook his head. "Just dealing with a lowlife. I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila had already opened the door to her apartment, and they both stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe you should call the Axe Gang for backup, Mr. Fitzgerald. Shawn's a mean fighter, and he's got some shady friends in town. I'm worried he might come back with reinforcements and get the better of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus had proven himself capable in a fight, Lila couldn't help but worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the look on Shawn's face when he left, he was definitely going to round up his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it. A few thugs don't scare me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dismissed her concerns with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they continued talking, Marcus learned about the history between Lila and Shawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning more about that kind of person only made Marcus despise him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Lila, she had given him a chance before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he blew it when he got caught with prostitutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of showing any remorse, he became even more obsessive towards Lila, constantly interfering in her private life by claiming to be her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly disgusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus planned to deal with this nuisance before leaving Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, there was urgent banging on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's angry voice came through from outside. "Come out and face death, you son of a bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's brow furrowed at the sound. "Mr. Fitzgerald," she said to Marcus, "that's Shawn. Knowing him, he's brought backup. He wouldn't be banging on the door like that otherwise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nonchalantly replied as he opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's arrogant face came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood more than a dozen young men in courier uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all armed, some with daggers, others with metal pipes and machetes. Each face twisted with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shawn, is this the punk who crossed you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them pointed at Marcus while asking Shawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn nodded with a vicious glare. "That's right, it's this guy. He not only beat me up but also took my girl. Today, I'll make him pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shawn, you've always taken care of us brothers. We'll follow your lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's words were met with unanimous agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear they all reeked of alcohol - they must have just been drinking with Shawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The liquid courage was what brought them here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all have families to support, and delivery work isn't easy. I don't want to make things difficult for you. If you don't want to get mixed up in this, you can leave now. I'm only saying this once. Make your choice," Marcus warned, his eyes scanning over the delivery workers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The delivery workers' eyes flashed with contempt. One of them spoke up, "Guys, don't listen to his nonsense. He's just scared of what we'll do to him. He crossed Shawn, and today, we're going to make him pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words only strengthened the delivery workers' resolve to confront Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's face lit up with smug satisfaction. "Hey punk, I bet you're really regretting it now! You're regretting that you crossed me, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're feeling sorry, it's not too late. Get on your knees and beg for mercy. And while you're at it, strip that woman down and let me have my way with her. Maybe then I'll spare your pathetic life!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
