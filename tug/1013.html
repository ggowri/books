  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought Marcus was going to pay for his arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's heart raced with worry. She could feel the overwhelming destructive force in Howard's Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Could Marcus really survive this? Will he be able to withstand such a devastating blow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Howard's attack came crashing down, Marcus simply threw out a light punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, his punch looked almost like a joke, with no power behind it at all, just a casual swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to everyone's surprise, that punch cut through the air and directly intercepted Howard's devastating attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion shook the space around them, and the terrifying shockwave spread in all directions, the destructive force rippling outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Howard's eyes widened in disbelief. He hadn't expected Marcus to not only resist but to be so bold as to try and block his powerful Hand Strike with such a casual punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking quickly, Howard channeled more of his destructive power into his strike, intent on crushing Marcus with an even more ferocious blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could react further, a burst of overwhelming destruction erupted from Marcus' punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the punch tore apart Howard's attack, shattering it into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the explosion kept echoing as Howard's once-unstoppable Hand Strike disintegrated entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Marcus' punch didn't lose any power. It only grew more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could blink, the punch was right in front of Howard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Howard screamed, panic flashing across his face as he tried to evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. The seemingly simple punch was wrapped in an unbreakable binding force, trapping the elder in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't escape, and all he could do was watch as the punch descended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another explosion rang out, even louder this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single punch, Howard's head was obliterated, his body crumpling to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left everyone from the Tucker family frozen in place, eyes wide in shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Howard had been an expert at the Return Essence stage, a powerhouse who should've been leagues above anyone at the Foundation Establishment stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had expected him to wipe the floor with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, they watched in horror as Howard couldn't even withstand one attack and was obliterated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie, standing beside Marcus, was just as stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, she had never imagined that Marcus could defeat someone at Howard's level, especially when his punch had seemed so casual, almost too simple to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she was speechless. Marcus had killed Howard with a single strike. It felt like a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This level of strength is pathetic. Why don't you have your three Grandmasters come out instead?" Marcus' voice was cold, his gaze sweeping over the remaining Tucker family members with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's face went pale. He had never seen a young man so terrifyingly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, he used his spiritual senses to probe Marcus' age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard he searched, there was no sign that Marcus had lived a samsara. He was, in fact, very young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization sent a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please deal with this bastard! Avenge our family!" Brett didn't hesitate, bowing low to the three elders behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that with Marcus' power, if the Grandmasters didn't step in, the Tucker family had no hope of standing against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Grandmasters exchanged looks and stepped forward together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, a Grandmaster with sharp eyes, addressed Marcus directly, "Kid, I'll give you credit. Your strength is impressive. But don't think that just because you killed someone who had barely reached the Return Essence stage, you can act like you're untouchable in front of us."</span></p><div class="pagination">
