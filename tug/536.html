  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum reverberated through the air as Marcus stepped forward with his Shadow Step, appearing directly in front of Grandmaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandmaster wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and his eyes were filled with defiance. "I warn you, don't make a move against me. I serve Mr. Roger Gellar. If you harm me, he will never let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Marcus' level of cultivation must mean he knew of Roger's infamous reputation&mdash;a fact he hoped would be enough to save his life. But Marcus merely sneered, and his lips curled into a cold smile. "Roger? I kill his men for sport."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus unleashed another devastating Fist Ray. Its destructive force surged toward Grandmaster. "Since you seek my death, don't think you'll leave here alive either," Grandmaster roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the Fist Ray could connect, his body erupted in a blinding light, radiating immense destructive energy. An earth-shaking explosion followed, obliterating everything in its path. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force expanded rapidly, consuming members of Black Dragon Society before they could react. Many were reduced to ashes instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining members, stricken with terror, tried to escape, but the destructive shockwave swept through the square with unparalleled speed, leaving no survivors. Though Marcus had been closest to Grandmaster, he avoided the worst of the explosion by using Teleportation in the nick of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, he stood atop a mountain peak several kilometers away. Even so, the blast's immense energy reached him. Marcus' clothes were in tatters, and his skin was marred with cuts and streaks of blood. Fortunately, the injuries were superficial. With some recovery, he would return to peak condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That old monster... resorting to self-destruction to take me down with him. If I didn't have teleport, even with my Ancient Martial Stage Seven, I'd have perished," Marcus mused, and a chill ran through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion's force was on par with an attack from an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert&mdash;a power so devastating that no one could hope to survive it. Marcus silently thanked his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, which had saved him time and time again in life-threatening situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain peak stood over a mile high. From its summit, one could gaze out and take in the scenery stretching dozens of miles into the distance. From his vantage point atop the mountain, Marcus could see the aftermath clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Dragon Society's headquarters lay in ruins, and its once-mighty structures were reduced to rubble. The plaza was a hellscape, consumed by fire and destruction. Flames surged into the sky, trapping those who had escaped the initial blast. Screams of agony filled the air as the society descended into chaos. Only a handful managed to flee. Most perished in the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't concern himself with the destruction. His mission had been to eliminate Black Dragon Society's leadership, not to massacre its ordinary members. But Grandmaster's self-destruction had sealed the society's fate, condemning its members to a grim end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seated cross-legged atop the mountain peak, Marcus began to heal. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the aid of healing pills, the recovery took over three hours. Meanwhile, news of the massacre at Black Dragon Society and the Griffin family spread across Crankhurst like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire nation was in turmoil. Black Dragon Society's branches declared emergency status, but it was futile. With their headquarters in ruins and Grandmaster and Alexander dead, the society's days were numbered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rival factions saw their chance to claim the spoils. Within half a day, Black Dragon Society's branches were seized, its assets divided among the opportunistic powers of Crankhurst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once hailed as the nation's top ninja organization, Black Dragon Society was no more. Marcus didn't linger. Using teleport, he returned to Kingston. He had yet to visit Josie, whom he had promised to meet. Today, he decided, was the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his teleportation coordinates were slightly off, placing him squarely in the middle of a busy street. A BMW 3 Series barreled toward him at high speed. The driver, startled by Marcus' sudden appearance, slammed on the brakes. But it was too late. The car struck Marcus, sending him crashing to the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
