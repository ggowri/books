  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've been through a samsara, so we look like we're only in our early twenties," Diana replied faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does a samsara mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt increasingly curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the eyes of the wizards in Weston Land, a samsara is equal to a hundred years, and you can consider that Alison and I have been living in this world for one hundred and twenty years until this year. Mr. Fitzgerald, is that clear to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blinked her gorgeous eyes and explained it to Marcus quite attentively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't told Marcus any of this before then because Marcus was just transforming from a normal human at that time, unable to accept something that seemed to defy common sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, why don't you say something? You don't think I'm old, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus was hesitant to say anything, Diana asked hurriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus inhaled a deep breath and said, "How come? I was just thinking about something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Diana's words, Marcus was relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Alison had already experienced a samsara, and they were at least one hundred and twenty years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they had much more time to cultivate and improve their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would also go a long way </span><span>toward</span><span> </span><span>explaining why the two's power and state were so impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know what level the warriors will reach when breaking through the Foundation Establishment Stage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, stating his main concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are nine stages of Ancient Martial Art cultivation, which is the Foundation Establishment Stage. After that, you will get to the Acquired State," Diana explained calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was Acquired State?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time Marcus heard this term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was filled with endless yearning for Acquired State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I heard that you were only a Level Five Demon Fighter a few months ago. Why has your power grown so fast recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The improvement in Diana's power had apparently exceeded Alison's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of which, I have to appreciate you for making my power advance so quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what Marcus said, a hint of blush appeared on Diana's face as she said, "I did break through the state of Level Seven Demon Fighter before, but my power hadn't made any progress since then. It wasn't until the Dual Cultivation with you helped me overcome my bottleneck that my power was raised to the state of Level Nine Demon Fighter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus heard this, a hint of relief appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't expect that Dual Cultivation had brought such great benefits to Diana at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the Dual Cultivation has done you so much good, why don't we hurry up and do it again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced over Diana's body recklessly. Immediately afterward, he directly carried her body, opened the car door, and placed her in the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana exclaimed in shock as she felt Marcus' brutal behavior, but there was no way for her to resist, so she could only let him do whatever he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marcus started the car and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove at full power, and it didn't take him long to drive into a deserted area at the seaside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't stop her heart from beating so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I tell you that? Dual Cultivation, of course," Marcus said with a grin. Just as he finished speaking, he kissed Diana right on the lips and sucked them hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's feelings also seemed to be mobilized as she gradually gasped for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body also became tender from the tension she had felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Diana's face turned flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took Diana's leather skirt right off, exposing her bulging breasts. Due to her large size, her bra couldn't even truly wrap around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus ripped Diana's bra off, two huge breasts popped out, her areolas perfectly pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sucked it in and savored it to his heart's content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana panted as it soon became wet between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus touched her private parts directly with his hand, moving it between her wet legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a moan as she felt as if her body had been electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus touched Diana's private parts, she felt an orgasm in a flash. A large amount of fluid was secreted as her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling of relief that she hadn't felt in a long time filled her entire body, making her feel inexplicably empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't take it anymore, as he removed his clothes fast and went straight into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sound, Diana let out a scream as her body seemed to be filled entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An intense feeling of satisfaction flooded her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus got into Diana, he released the power of Dual Cultivation, causing both of them to double their feelings of pleasure all of a sudden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana almost fainted straight away, wondering why Marcus was so good at doing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Marcus made her desperate for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but spread her legs as if she was dying for Marcus to get into her deepest parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kissed Diana's body as he went in and out. He felt the wetness and warmth between his legs as he enjoyed it actively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Marcus changed various postures. He made Diana feel orgasmic with each change.</span></p><div class="pagination">
