  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Trevor, you've always claimed that the Leah family's Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation is the most powerful Rune in Uswad's world of Ancient Martial Art. Today, I want to experience it once again," a provocative voice echoed from the flying warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speaker was a tall elderly man with golden hair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This elderly man was Pedro Henderson, from the Henderson family, another Ancient Martial Art family in the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Henderson family and the Leah family have always been at odds, even competing over many resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the years, these two families have clashed and fought multiple times, with both sides suffering losses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last conflict occurred three months ago. At that time, the two families dueled at the peak of the Kinton Mountains over a crystal mine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That battle was intense, causing a huge sensation in the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although there was still no clear winner, the Leah family's nine Grandmasters used the Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation to kill Pedro's only son, Latham Henderson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro was furious and had been seeking an opportunity to take revenge on the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, although Pedro's cultivation reached Acquired State Seven, he couldn't achieve victory against the combined strength of the Leah family's nine Grandmasters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, without the assistance of the family elders, he would most likely have died to the Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, however, the situation was different. Pedro befriended an expert from the world beyond Ice Wall, Kyson Shelton.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kyson claimed to be a warrior under Roderick. Although his cultivation only reached Acquired State Eight, Pedro felt an unprecedented sense of oppression when facing him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro couldn't even withstand a casual attack from Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, although Kyson's cultivation was only one level higher than Pedro's, their combat strength differed greatly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kyson promised Pedro that if Pedro was willing to submit to him, when Roderick took control of this world, he would help Pedro eliminate all obstacles and past enemies, then make Pedro the master of Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro was already on the brink of death in front of Kyson. Facing such generous terms, Pedro naturally had no reason to refuse and readily agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kyson set his sights on Kinton Mountains first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Pedro listed his former enemies, the Leah family, as the first to deal with.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, the current scene unfolded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Kyson stood beside Pedro.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very thin, with sunken eyes, giving off an eerie vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lemuria was ruled by the Ophidian, and Roderick was also an Ophidian. As Roderick's warrior, Kyson was naturally an Ophidian too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Kyson appeared as an ordinary human at the moment, Marcus instantly recognized him as an Ophidian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on the energy he emitted, Marcus felt that his strength was much greater than Rivers' before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Pedro bringing the Henderson family's experts to descend over Emotionless Gorge, the Leah family's expressions turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor sneered and said to Pedro, "Pedro, three months ago, your son died in the Leah family's Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation. I didn't expect you to offend the Leah family again. In that case, I won't spare you this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the other eight Grandmasters unleashed powerful energy, ready for battle at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really think I came unprepared this time? Let me tell you the truth, Mr. Shelton by my side can easily break the Leah family's Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation," Pedro said smugly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Kyson, standing beside him, stepped forward and scanned everyone in the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were deep red, exuding an extremely sharp aura. Finally, his gaze landed on Gertie and Minerva.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you send these two women to my bed, I might spare your lives. Otherwise, after today, there will be no Leah family in the Kinton Mountains," Kyson said arrogantly, his gaze toward Gertie and Minerva filled with greed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
