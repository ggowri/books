  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place was far different from what Marcus had imagined a space-time tunnel would look like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast emptiness and the endless expanse inspired a bone-deep fear, a terror that </span><span>seemed to claw at the very essence of one's soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp, piercing screech suddenly echoed through the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a swarm of beasts with black wings surged toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These creatures looked vaguely like vampire bats, but their wings resembled those of birds, and their heads were eerily reptilian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gaping mouths revealed inch-long razor-sharp teeth, and their bodies emanated dark spatial forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful, Mr. Fitzgerald. These creatures survive on spatial forces. If they bite you, even once, the spatial forces within the tunnel will start tearing at your body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the wounds are too severe, the spatial forces will rip you apart completely!" Raphael warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a flicker of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected these seemingly insignificant beasts to </span><span>possess</span><span> such deadly power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood all too well how terrifying spatial forces could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had experienced it firsthand when he entered the space-time gate, the sensation of his body being torn by invisible giants as if he could be shredded at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screeching intensified, and the beasts lunged toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the trio was far stronger than ordinary people, the suddenness of the attack threw them into temporary disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swiftly summoned a Firebolt. The fiery energy surged forward, enveloping the beasts in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few of the creatures let out agonized cries, struggling for mere moments before they were reduced to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ada wasn't as fortunate. A beast sank its teeth into her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, an overwhelming spatial force descended upon her, tearing violently at her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brow furrowed as he unleashed a series of Firebolts and bolts of lightning, forcing the attacking beasts to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly channeled a surge of Timeless Numinous Energy into Ada, driving out the invading spatial force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This intervention prevented her body from being shredded, but her shoulder was left bleeding profusely, with a long, gruesome gash that looked alarmingly severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These creatures are terrifying," Marcus thought grimly, bracing himself for the next wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved Ada behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heavenly Circle Diagram began to activate in his mind, and his body became surrounded by a shimmering light of runes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intricate patterns of the runes flowed into his palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sweeping gesture, he unleashed the rune patterns into the void. They morphed into a massive totemic symbol, encompassing the entire area around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beasts grew even bolder, launching a ferocious assault against the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus muttered an incantation, the rune totem roared to life, channeling devastating energy into the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The runes retaliated with relentless force, cutting down the creatures one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air </span><span>was </span><span>filled with the grotesque sound of beasts being torn apart. Black blood splattered everywhere, releasing a foul, corrosive stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, Marcus had wiped out every last one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael stared at him in stunned disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated that Marcus would not only possess extraordinary combat skills and healing abilities but also command the profound power of runes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Raphael's eyes, Marcus seemed capable of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you feeling?" Marcus asked Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada winced, her face pale. "It hurts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at her mangled shoulder and felt a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and pressed his palm against her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stream of Timeless Numinous Energy flowed into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy's healing properties were remarkable, and since Marcus had reached the peak of the Ancient Martial Stage Nine, its effects were even more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under its influence, Ada's wound began to close rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, her shoulder had completely healed, leaving her skin unblemished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Raphael and Ada watched in awe, their disbelief plain on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had known Marcus' medical skills were astonishing, seeing it firsthand was an entirely different experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're incredible!" Raphael exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved off the compliment and resumed walking forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For reasons she couldn't explain, </span><span>Ada</span><span> felt an inexplicable sense of safety whenever Marcus was by her side, no matter how perilous the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deeper they ventured into the tunnel, the more oppressive it became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no end in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings were pitch-black, like the depths of a cosmic black hole, as if ready to devour everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next hour, Marcus, Raphael, and Ada pressed on through the endless void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, they faced numerous attacks from the tunnel's peculiar beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creatures were unlike anything from the normal world, their forms bizarre and their methods of attack even stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the beasts weren't exceedingly powerful, they still caused trouble for the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for Marcus' overwhelming strength and battle-hardened instincts, the journey would have been far more dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within</span><span> the span of an hour, they had slain countless creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the beasts weren't the only threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tunnel was rife with hidden perils, from sudden spatial storms to abrupt collapses in the tunnel itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this place, a single mistake could mean death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kept his spiritual senses on full alert, maintaining vigilance at all times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the trio couldn't avoid minor injuries along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and its potent healing abilities, they managed to treat their wounds as they advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What lies at the end of this space-time tunnel?" Marcus mused aloud after smashing a beast's head with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael replied, "This tunnel leads to the world beyond the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall. Only by overcoming its countless trials can we reach the other side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze </span><span>hardened,</span><span> his determination etched onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He led Raphael and Ada onward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, they entered a dense, foggy region shrouded in layers of mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mist concealed countless dangers. Strange, powerful creatures emerged one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as they delved deeper into the fog, the beasts grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drew his golden scimitar, carving a bloody path through the treacherous terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after three grueling hours, they broke free from the suffocating mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ahead of them stood a towering fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The structure, with its nine imposing levels, radiated an ethereal golden light. It loomed before them, majestic and unyielding, exuding an overwhelming sense of grandeur.</span></p><div class="pagination">
