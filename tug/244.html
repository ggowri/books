  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the assigned seat and frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole wasn't very tall and had severe nearsightedness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seat was a good 20&ndash;25 feet from the blackboard, making it nearly impossible for her to see clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remembered that when school had just started, Nicole's previous homeroom teacher had assigned seats based on height, placing her in the front row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that teacher had taken a six-month leave for health reasons, and the current homeroom teacher had since taken over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you standing there for? The parent-teacher meeting is about to start! Go take your seat!" the homeroom teacher barked, her tone growing more impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to her calmly and said, "Excuse me, teacher, but your message in the group chat stated the meeting begins at 1:00 p.m. sharp. It's now only 12:50. By that measure, I am not late, am I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher froze, clearly not expecting him to talk back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, she shot back, "I said 1:00, so 1:00 it is! Everyone else has arrived early, </span><span>so</span><span> shouldn't you? Or do you think the entire group should wait on you? As Nicole's guardian, you should set an example. Punctuality is the bare minimum for adults! With such behavior, how can you hope to raise a successful child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her disdain was evident, etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole was the only student in the class from a rural family; all the other students came from well-off families&mdash;government officials, corporate executives, and private business owners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher's prejudice toward Nicole was hardly subtle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her remarks drew murmurs of agreement from other parents, each eager to curry favor with the teacher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They criticized Marcus with feigned indignation, their real aim being to ensure the teacher's goodwill toward their own children. In this social climate, flattery and bribery toward educators had become commonplace, turning some teachers into petty tyrants. Though truly dedicated and compassionate teachers still existed, they were increasingly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked coldly. "Let me ask you something, Teacher. If you changed the meeting time, shouldn't you have informed us in the group chat? As far as I can see, there's no such notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher's face darkened further. "This is my classroom. My rules apply. If you don't like it, you're welcome to request a transfer for Nicole. There's no need for this argument. Frankly, your lack of manners will only harm Nicole in the long run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's absolutely right," one parent chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. If he doesn't like it, he should transfer Nicole out," another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained unfazed. "First of all," he said sharply, "this classroom doesn't belong to you; it's for the students. As a teacher, you should conduct yourself professionally and refrain from making personal attacks. You're here to serve the students, not the other way around. Know your role."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Secondly, my sister Nicole is neither particularly tall nor average-sighted&mdash;she has severe nearsightedness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why, then, did you assign her a seat at the very back? Are you unaware that she can't see the blackboard from there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't about to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't had much schooling himself, but he remembered a time when teachers truly cared about their students, treating them like their own children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? Too many of them seemed to lack integrity, focused only on their own interests, with a shallow view of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit like a whip, leaving the teacher flustered, her face turning red as she struggled to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a middle-aged woman in her forties, dressed head-to-toe in designer clothing, stood up from her seat and confronted Marcus. "I'm the one who asked the teacher to change the seating arrangement. Do you have a problem with that?" she asked haughtily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to her, his tone calm but firm. "How tall is your child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six-foot-tall," she answered, pride evident in her voice. "He's on the school basketball team. Why do you ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sparked murmurs among the other parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those who had stayed silent couldn't help but acknowledge how unreasonable it was for a boy that tall to be seated in the front row. Still, none dared to openly criticize her, aware of her wealth and influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned back to the teacher. "My sister is five-foot-three and severely nearsighted. Do you honestly think it's fair for her to sit in the back while someone six feet tall sits in the front? How does that make sense?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
