You just give in and give the villa to Mr. White, but you insist on fighting for it. Don't you even consider your strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you win over Mr. White? Now that this guy has caused big trouble, and you will also be implicated. Maybe even </span><span>BioFusion</span><span> Pharmaceuticals will suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, sometimes, it is important to judge people by their appearance. Some people are not suitable for a great event."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager glanced at Marcus inadvertently. She said this deliberately to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, will we </span><span>be</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie asked Marcus in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was supported by the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was somewhat insecure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But through her contact with Marcus, Josie had come to trust Marcus very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two of them first met, even a small incident could scare Josie to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now facing the Burnett family, Josie just asked one question without showing much nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus patted Josie on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus' words, Josie felt completely relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always been mysterious in her heart, but every time, as long as he said it was okay, it would be fine, which gave Josie a strong sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are about to die but still pretending to be calm. I admire your acting skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin sneered, looking contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seal all the exits of the sales office. Don't let this guy get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales office manager ordered the security guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen security guards immediately took orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly blocked the sales office exits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, other guests were also locked in, and some guests who wanted to leave dared not speak out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, a convoy of luxury cars arrived and stopped at Flourish Manor's parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was specially assigned to open the car door for Donald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald was dressed in a suit and looked very stylish. Following him were the members of the Axe Gang whom he had hired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the guidance of the sales office security guard, they entered the sales office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here they come! Donald has brought his men here. Now we are going to watch a good show!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice sounded from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people looked over and saw Donald and his men arriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin stepped forward to greet him respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Burnett, you are here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Donald to bring so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought it was because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't know that Donald had selfish motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the boy who beat up your wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin raised his hand and pointed in Marcus' direction, saying, "Mr. Burnett, it was him who not only beat my wife but also said a lot of insulting words to you. You can't let him go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was indeed good at adding fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Donald immediately became angry and ordered the men of the Axe Gang, "Come on. Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donald, we meet again so soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before they could take any action, a familiar voice was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's body trembled, and he subconsciously looked at Marcus, saying, "Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd also noticed that something was wrong with Donald, and all of them showed surprised expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald reacted and immediately asked the others to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang's members were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Billy, the yellow-haired young man also recognized Marcus and widened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw what happened at the Axe Gang headquarters yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he met Marcuse again who made Blake kneel and surrender to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Burnett, what's wrong with you? Why don't you do anything? Do you know him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin asked Donald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald slapped Kevin in the face, causing him to fall to the ground. Kevin asked in confusion, "Mr. Burnett, what are you doing? Shouldn't you be hitting him? Why are you hitting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're blind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald was so angry that he gritted his teeth, and while speaking, he punched and kicked Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He almost offended Marcus because of his son and thought he had escaped that disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect that Kevin would pull him back again today.</span></p><div class="pagination">
