  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Burnett!" Alvin replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected anyone to dare cause trouble in Harvey's private villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After shooting Marcus a venomous glare, he scurried out of the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, it's all my fault for dragging you into this party. Harvey will have his men here any minute. You should take Marcus and leave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina stepped forward and apologized with guilt and urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave? After I've been beaten? Mr. Burnett's men are on their way, and I'm not stopping until I break every bone in his body!" Troy yelled, his voice dripping with venom as he lay sprawled on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Troy parted his lips to speak, Marcus delivered a swift kick to his lower abdomen. With a piercing scream, Troy tumbled backward, his body arcing gracelessly through the air before he splashed into the swimming pool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak again, and I'll end you right here," Marcus growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of murderous intent danced in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had appointed Lester as the president of Rising Group because of his competence and reputation within the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had never expected that such a respected man would spawn a degenerate son like Troy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus shot Troy a chilling stare, Troy clamped his mouth shut, his bravado evaporating like dew under the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This guy is clearly just a hick from the sticks, yet he exudes an aura so powerful that it makes my blood run cold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, let's just go!" Natalia pleaded, clutching his arm. Her eyes brimmed with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she knew Marcus was no ordinary man, she couldn't shake the fear gnawing at her. After all, they were facing Harvey, the scion of one of Kingston's most powerful families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if Marcus got hurt in front of these three?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Natalia. I'll be fine," Marcus assured her with a calm smile. He then settled into a rocking chair, crossing his legs with an air of nonchalance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other girls present were all in a state of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had started as a glamorous party had devolved into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' ruthless methods had left them shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "How in the world does this guy, who looks like a total drifter, manage to hold his ground so tall and confident against Harvey, Troy, and Peter, who come from the most prestigious families in Kingston?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he is undeniably skilled in combat, he's still just a nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett family alone is a force he couldn't hope to challenge, let alone the families of Troy and Peter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a dozen burly thugs armed with steel pipes stormed into the courtyard. They fanned out, encircling Marcus with menacing glares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey </span><span>smirked,</span><span> his confidence restored. "Hick, you think you can just waltz into my villa and start throwing punches? Looks like you've got a death wish. If you don't want to end up in a body bag, kneel down and apologize right now. And let Natalia spend the night with me. Maybe, just maybe, I'll spare your worthless life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and the other girls shuddered at Harvey's words. It was clear that Harvey was ready to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus didn't kneel and hand over Natalia, he was going to die tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his unmatched skills in combat, there was no way Marcus could stand a chance against a dozen armed thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think these clowns are enough to take me down?" Marcus sneered, his voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey's face twisted into a storm of fury as he flung his arms toward the thugs and demanded, "Since this hick's too clueless to know what's good for him, teach him a </span><span>lesson he'll never forget! Beat him until he's crawling on the ground, begging for mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs exchanged a quick nod. In a heartbeat, they surged forward like a pack of ravenous wolves, throwing their steel pipes at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even flinch, too at ease to even consider standing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how ferocious the thugs' attacks became, they couldn't even scratch him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, every strike Marcus unleashed was a devastating force, each one capable of inflicting mortal wounds on the thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, the air was filled with muffled thuds and the piercing, blood-curdling screams of the thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than a minute had passed, and more than a dozen thugs lay sprawled on the ground, their bodies crumpling like paper dolls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some writhed on the ground, clutching broken limbs, while others lay still, their lives extinguished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never anticipated that Marcus was such a formidable fighter. No wonder he had the audacity to remain so composed in the face of Harvey and the other two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, Troy, and Peter's faces twisted into expressions of pure disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never in their wildest dreams had they imagined that the hick standing before them would turn out to be such a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Burnett," Troy yelled through his gritted teeth and hauled himself out of the swimming pool. "I'll have my dad deal with this hick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the awe-inspiring might that Marcus displayed, which far exceeded anything Troy had anticipated, Troy believed Marcus paled in comparison with Lester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester was not merely the president of Rising Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man with tendrils reaching deep into both the glittering and shadowy underbellies of Kingston. Troy thought, "With a mere nod, Dad can summon a lethal expert to deal with this naive country bumpkin."</span></p><div class="pagination">
