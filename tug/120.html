How is this possible? How can you reflect my attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's voice was filled with hopelessness as he screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked coldly and said, "You don't deserve to know. Just die peacefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, a deafening explosion echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's body was torn apart by the destructive force, reduced to fragments scattered across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Reversal was an ability Marcus had gained after breaking through Stage Two of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, Marcus had honed the skill of Celestial Reversal to perfection through rigorous training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When fully activated, Celestial Reversal could reflect attacks with several times their original power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Ricardo was at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three, his attack became his own death knell under the power of Celestial Reversal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Ricardo die on the spot, Marcus collapsed to the ground, his body completely drained of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already sustained significant injuries during the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fully deploying Celestial Reversal had taken a serious toll on his energy reserves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he lay on the ground, gasping for air, his forehead drenched in cold sweat, his face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly retrieving a medicinal herb from his Spatial Ring, he swallowed it, and his face regained a faint trace of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That battle was way too close. If it weren't for my magic crystal and Celestial Reversal, I would've never stood a chance against Ricardo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought to himself, his heart still trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware that he still had a significant gap to close to match an Ancient Martial Stage Three expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his dual training in magic and martial arts, it wasn't enough to bridge the enormous gap in levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This world was full of hidden experts, including those from Ancient Martial Art Sects and Wizard Guilds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were countless other masters from various professions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, orcs, ghost cultivators, beastmasters, physical enhancers, array masters, metahumans, and even cyborgs with surgical implants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These individuals often possessed abilities beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In every field, there were beings of extraordinary power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had defeated Ricardo, he dared not let it go to his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle had only deepened his awareness of his own insignificance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he needed to improve his strength as quickly as possible to secure his survival when faced with future crises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Ricardo's attack confirmed something for Marcus&mdash;his second brother was now fully aware of him and was attempting to eliminate him through Ricardo's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After resting for a while, Marcus got up and retrieved Ricardo's Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of the Brown family in Kingston, Ricardo was undoubtedly incredibly wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was eager to see what treasures might be hidden in Ricardo's Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning to Sunshine Estates, Josie was still resting as she had locked her door earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of the night, Marcus climbed to the fifth floor by hand and entered the room through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie didn't notice that Marcus had been out earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't disturb her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened Ricardo's Spatial Ring and quickly inventoried its contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides hundreds of billions in cash, Ricardo's personal belongings were extraordinarily plentiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They included martial manuals, medicinal herbs, and several Ancient Martial Art artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the items was a notebook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Marcus opened it to find a detailed list of all the businesses under the Brown family, as well as Ricardo's significant milestones in his Ancient Martial cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It even included some secrets of the Ancient Martial world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus skimmed through the contents, deciding to review them more thoroughly later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His focus shifted to the Brown family's business empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Marcus a full ten minutes to finish reading the list, leaving him deeply shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Brown family of Kingston truly lived up to its reputation as one of Uswad's top families, with industries sprawling like an empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their holdings were even more vast than Marcus had imagined, a true commercial empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the Brown family, the Golden Group under Marcus's control seemed like a mere drop in the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the list were several businesses that caught Marcus's attention. He set his sights on a few cutting-edge tech companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These companies were part of emerging industries with high technological value, and because there were few investors in this field, their profits were remarkably lucrative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Ricardo gone, the Brown family in Kingston was bound to collapse, plunging into a state of chaos for a considerable period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus planned to take over some of the Brown family's core businesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would allow him to rapidly expand his own business empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this idea in mind, Marcus began calculating. At present, he only had about 10 billion dollars at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That amount was far from enough to acquire the Brown family's key businesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's demise, however, had conveniently delivered a windfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After tallying up Ricardo's Spatial Ring, Marcus found over 50 billion dollars inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Converted to Uswad currency, it amounted to 350 billion dollars&mdash;more than enough to acquire several sizable companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this gave Marcus a small boost of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus extracted higher-grade medicinal herbs from Ricardo's Spatial Ring, ground them into powder, and consumed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using the healing techniques from the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, he began to recover from his injuries.</span></p><div class="pagination">
