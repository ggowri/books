  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada couldn't help but let out a loud cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, every sensitive nerve in her body was roused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her vagina became slightly wet. Meanwhile, a powerful sense of emptiness welled up within her, which was exactly the same as the feeling she experienced when recalling her sex with Marcus late at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea what was wrong with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada forcefully activated the Numinous Energy in an attempt to suppress this evil sensation, but it became stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She soon lost herself. At that very moment, her shapely legs clamped together and began to rub up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She yearned for the base of her thigh to brush her clitoris.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the slightest, inadvertent touch sent a jolt of pleasure through her, as if she'd been struck by an electric current. That indescribable, tingling numbness instantly coursed through every part of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, she reached the climax that had been constantly on her mind in her dreams!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada let out a high-pitched cry, and her mind went blank!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming sense of comfort carried her away to the extent that she even forgot that Marcus was caressing her breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's sultry expression aroused Marcus and caused him to have an erection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Blood Curse was more arduous to treat compared to other illnesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pace of the treatment was comparatively sluggish as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no choice but to do his utmost to restrain his carnal desires. He promptly began to practice the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, gradually and painstakingly channeling the Timeless Numinous Energy into Ada's body in small increments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she had an orgasm, rather than subsiding, her inner urge grew even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just felt an unusual emptiness inside her vagina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire body writhed continuously, and she let out soft gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel so uncomfortable. I feel so uncomfortable. When will the treatment be over?" Ada asked, her voice carrying a rather alluring tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Just hold on for a while. It will take about half an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada felt as if she couldn't endure it any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After another orgasm, her vagina was completely wet, soaking her underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the treatment didn't come to an end, she truly had no idea what sort of immoral actions she might take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by a buzzing sound, Marcus pumped the even more potent Timeless Numinous Energy into Ada's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantaneously, a more intense feeling of emptiness surged forth and swept over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada could no longer stand this kind of impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out to her crotch tremblingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, her fingers were stained with an unknown liquid. She couldn't help but rub her extremely empty private parts with her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every touch reached the source of happiness hidden in Ada's mysterious gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire body seemed to be jolted by an electric shock, and she let out continuous moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A copious amount of liquid oozed out once more, and the sense of emptiness grew increasingly intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows slightly. When forcefully practicing the Dual Cultivation with Ada last time, he had found that although she appeared pure and innocent and had never been sexually active, her libido seemed to be much stronger than that of a normal woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A casual caress was enough to overwhelm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the same at that moment. Her first orgasm came from the friction between her own legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, she actually stretched out her hand to stroke her labia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, at a certain moment, Ada had her second orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some fluid spurted from her vagina, leaving her private parts in a mess.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her moans became more and more enchanting, and she was completely immersed in endless lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but place her hands on Marcus' body and fondle him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last vestige of rationality within Ada compelled her to draw back her arms, and her delicate face flushed an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just endure it a little longer," Marcus said. Then, he continued to operate the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to remove the Blood Curse from Ada's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the ensuing period, she suffered the torment that intertwined comfort and pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, she actually had her third orgasm, trembling all over. With an ecstatic expression, she was on the verge of fainting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Blood Curse was lifted, Marcus started to recover the Timeless Numinous Energy bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ineffable sense of comfort ebbed away gradually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While coming back to her senses, Ada surprisingly felt a tinge of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the treatment over?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. How are you feeling now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am fine. Thank you," Ada said, her face still flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm leaving now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had witnessed all of her inappropriate actions from moments ago. As a result, Ada was too ashamed to face him and was eager to seize the chance to run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before she could take a step, he grabbed hold of her arm and pulled her forcefully into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She uttered a faint shriek.&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination">
