  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm hungry. When's lunch?" Natalia asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon... I'm watching a movie.... hold on a sec... I'll go... go cook as soon as this part's over..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, an overwhelming orgasm ripped through her body, her head hit back to the wall, hands gripping tightly on Marcus' shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh God... So fucking good."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane shuddered violently as pleasure flooded her senses. She hadn't felt anything this intense since her husband died.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she almost forgot she was with Marcus and was going to shout out loud. Her vagina contracted violently, as if trying to suck the vibrator into her body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom? Are you alright? You sound weird..." Natalia continued to inquire. She had a strong hunch that Jane was behaving quite strangely today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm... okay... do your homework... The meal will be ready soon..." Jane stated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each word was a struggle as the sensations grew stronger, awakening years of suppressed desires that had been slumbering deep within her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost to lust, she stripped off her nightgown, pressing her breasts against Marcus' face, rubbing them back and forth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... mmm... honey... you're so good, you're making me crazy..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... fuck me... I want your big cock deep inside me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harder, I'm close... Yeah..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caught sight of Jane flaunting herself, and a sneer of contempt appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he yanked out the vibrator from her pussy and tossed it aside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, the thought of you makes me sick," he smirked. "I wouldn't touch you even if you were the last woman alive."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he whirled around, made a swift exit through the corridor window, and vanished from the Winchester Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wave of anticipated bliss crashed to a sudden halt. Jane was left rooted to the spot, a palpable sense of desolation creeping over her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd never in her life bared her soul and lowered her pride for a man like this. And here was Marcus, that spineless waste, spurning her advances.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a seething hatred for Marcus took hold of Jane's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no clue what was going on in Jane's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was from a back-of-beyond rural place. His foster parents were simple farmers, with no money and no social standing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus first landed in Solomia looking for a fresh start, he got roped into a marriage with the Winchesters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For three long years, </span><span>his wife </span><span>Abigail had been giving him the cold shoulder in their own house, treating him like some random stranger. She wouldn't even let him come near her - forget about any kind of intimacy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the bitch was getting cozy with Felix, the hotshot deputy GM at Golden Group, right under his nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to admit it, the Golden Group was a big dog in Solomia, with their fingers in every pie imaginable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As its deputy GM, Felix was rolling in money and had a high-profile social status.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a nobody like Marcus, Felix might as well have been on another planet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting payback? Yeah, that was gonna be about as easy as nailing jelly to a wall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Marcus was cooking up revenge schemes, the sky erupted with noise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A squadron of Galewing aircraft came screaming in from nowhere, their engines howling like banshees as they descended, kicking up a storm that turned day into dusk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, dozens of well-dressed men in sunglasses jumped out of the planes, each clutching a heavy-duty submachine gun. They exuded an intimidating presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, we're here to serve!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bombshell blonde in a skin-tight leather skirt at the front bowed deeply to Marcus. Her black-clad backup crew followed suit like they were greeting royalty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Fitzgerald? Serve?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brain short-circuited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up - you've got the wrong guy. Why are you calling me that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde's reply hit like a thunderbolt, "No mistake, Mr. Fitzgerald. You're the Godfather's third son. We're here on his direct orders!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What???</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Godfather!?</span></p><div class="pagination">
