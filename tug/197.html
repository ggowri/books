  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dark face, Donald replied, "Ms. Burnett, this man beat my son, and I wanted to get rid of him first before returning to the family to celebrate Sir Burnett's birthday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine frowned, and her face turned completely cold. "Marcus is my friend. If you want to get rid of him, get rid of me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald's face darkened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus actually knew Maxine. What was his identity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Donald still did not want to miss this opportunity to kill Marcus and continued, "Ms. Burnett, although you are friends, he caused trouble in my son's villa last night. My son is still hospitalized. I have to vent my anger. Ms. Burnett, even if </span><span>Sir Burnett knows this matter, you must have a reason to stop me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine growled, "How outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donald, don't think you can scare me by bringing up my grandfather. To tell you the truth, even if I don't get involved in this, your men can't hurt Marcus at all. Why don't you get out of here with them right away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald was displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that Maxine was trying to drive him away with her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing Maxine's determination, he was completely helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between their identities was too great. If he really annoyed Marcus today, things would escalate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, my son is a member of the Burnett family. Ms. Burnett, I don't understand why you are so protective of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald glanced icily at Marcus, unwilling to give up. "Before leaving, I want to remind you of something, Ms. Burnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is Sir Burnett's 80th birthday, and he will announce an important family decision. In addition, Shaun Whitman, the son of the Whitman family, will attend the birthday party and propose to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, at this critical moment, Ms. Burnett, you had better not get too close to other men. You will marry into the Whitman family sooner or later. Don't ruin the reputation of the Burnett family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald took his men away with a smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face turned extremely livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for her reluctance to return to the family home was that she did not want to face her impending engagement to Shaun.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still couldn't avoid it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Maxine had no idea about Matthew's important decision mentioned by Donald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett family had been prosperous, stable, and peaceful for many years. What exactly did Matthew want to announce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a convoy of luxurious business cars drove over from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many men in black got out of the cars and surrounded Marcus and Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of them even pulled out pistols and pressed them against their waists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An old man in a suit walked out of the crowd and saluted Maxine respectfully. "Hello, Ms. Burnett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tyler, what do you mean?" Maxine asked with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew had two sons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyler was the housekeeper of Maxine's uncle, Malcolm Burnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's father was the current head of the Burnett family, but Malcolm had always been eager to replace him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyler smiled, "Sir Burnett's birthday party is about to begin. Mr. Malcolm Burnett has ordered me to bring you back to the Burnett Villa safely. Please forgive me for being rude, Ms. Burnett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened, and he waved his hand at the gun-wielding men in black. "Take Ms. Burnett and that guy into the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in black nodded and accepted the order at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They tried to bring Marcus and Maxine into the business car together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Maxine stopped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else do you have to say, Ms. Burnett?" Tyler asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is not a member of the Burnett family. Tyler, let him go," Maxine said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a premonition that Matthew's birthday party this time would not be as simple as it seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to Shaun's unexpected proposal, there may be an even stronger storm waiting for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to implicate Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyler glanced at Marcus and said, "Ms. Burnett, since he is your friend, let's take him to the party. This is Mr. Malcolm Burnett's order, and I am just following it. I hope you won't be angry with me, Ms. Burnett!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take them away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gun-wielding men in black forcibly took Marcus and Maxine into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble. I didn't expect such an accident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry. No matter what happens later, as long as I'm still alive, I will protect you!" Maxine said apologetically, sitting in the business car.</span></p><div class="pagination">
