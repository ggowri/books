  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim roared, "It's because of you that I offended a big shot. My mother has been expelled from the Whitman family. You asshole!" He went crazy and beat Gary fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was bleeding, and he wailed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim seemed unsatisfied. He picked up an iron rod and smashed it hard on Gary. Each blow was hit with full force, and after a while, Gary's many bones were broken. He looked very miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene stunned the people around. No one expected that Tim would suddenly go crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was Tim's follower, and they had a close relationship. However, Tim suddenly beat Gary fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim stopped fighting until he was tired. He came to Marcus with a nervous look and knelt in front of him. Tim said with fear in his eyes, "I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald. I'm a fool. I shouldn't have offended you. Please spare me. Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tim spoke, he actually hugged Marcus' thighs and burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, looked at Tim with disdain, kicked him to the ground, and said coldly, "I warned you before, but you didn't listen to me. Your mother has been expelled from the Whitman family, and you beg me. It's too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Tim was desperate. He collapsed to the ground powerlessly. Before he could react, his phone rang again. The caller was William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim answered the call and said in despair, "Dad, is there anything else?" He was afraid that he would hear more bad news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William sighed, "I... The Department of Justice investigated me for corruption, bribery, and taking advantage of my position to seek personal gain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The department has issued an order to dismiss me from my post. I may be sent to prison soon. Take care of yourself. You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before William could finish his words, the call was forcibly hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Tim trembled as if struck by a bolt of lightning, and he almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother had been expelled from the Whitman family, and Tim had just thought the situation was not too bad. After all, William was still the director of the Department of Transportation, and they still had Rising Logistics Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in a short time, William had been dismissed and would probably be sent to jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Tim's last backer instantly vanished. Without William's connections, Tim could not survive in Solomia. It was all over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of th</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>e</span><span>, Tim was utterly depressed and fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim's servant immediately came forward and yelled in a panic, "Mr. Burton!" He helped Tim up, called an ambulance, and sent him to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was also put into the ambulance by the Rising Logistics Company's employees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the trouble of Darian Logistics Company</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s opening</span><span> was resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected that the result would be like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitman family, which Tim was proud of, was nothing in front of Marcus. With just one phone call from Marcus, the Whitman family expelled Tim's mother from the family. People could imagine how noble Marcus was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people even thought that William's dismissal was also related to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not give any explanation. In his eyes, Gary, William, and Tim were not his rivals at all. He could get rid of them with just a casual strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, even the Whitman family in Kingston has to listen to you. My previous worries were unnecessary!" Darian walked over and looked at Marcus with even more admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ramona and Kiera followed Darian and also looked at Marcus with admiring eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just worried that Marcus would be in danger because Tim had the Whitman family as a backer. The fact proved that their worries were unnecessary. The connections that Tim was proud of were nothing in Marcus' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's&nbsp;no&nbsp;big&nbsp;deal. They are good for nothing to me." Marcus waved his hand casually and walked towards the office of Darian Logistics Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian, Ramona, Kiera, and the employees of Darian Logistics Company had witnessed Marcus' strength. Only then did they realize that although the boss was young, he was a real big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus in charge, Darian Logistics Company would have a good development in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was filled with hope and energy, and they all looked excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus listened to work reports from Darian and several other people from Darian Logistics Company. After that, he gave some work suggestions to them and then left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, the news of William's dismissal spread throughout Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without William as a backer, Rising Logistics Company's business declined sharply, and its stock price plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Marcus acquired Rising Logistics Company at a price of five billion dollars.</span></p><div class="pagination">
