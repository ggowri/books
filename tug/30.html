  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm grip, Marcus swung the door open, only to be confronted by a menacing sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The narrow street was packed with thugs, weapons glinting ominously in the dim light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front stood Bob, flanked by a bald man whose presence radiated intimidation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob sneered, his voice dripping with mockery, "Didn't think you'd actually show your face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to challenge me on my turf? Today, I'll show you just what kind of power I wield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood tall, unflinching as he scanned the group. "Is this all you've got? Just a few guys? That's a bit disappointing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob's surprise quickly turned to a derisive grin. "Let me introduce you to Mr. West. He's the head of Tiger's Roar Association in the Serpent's Coil, and one of Godfather's eldest son, Bruce Gellar's top enforcers. With him in the mix, you can forget about leaving this place alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric West remained silent, but the air around him crackled with a dangerous intensity that sent chills down Marcus' spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Serpent's Coil was one of the three major gangs in Solomia, controlling a vast array of enterprises&mdash;from nightclubs to casinos and bathhouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their influence was so extensive that they had thousands of members, ruling the Charaling Road with an iron fist, leaving the local police too intimidated to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What truly caught Marcus' attention, however, was Bob's claim that Eric was connected to the Godfather's eldest son&mdash;his brother, whom he had never met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications were staggering. He had been warned by both Ryan and Diana that his two brothers wielded immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had assumed their influence was primarily limited to Weston Land, but now it was clear that their reach extended deep into Uswad territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization that Anthony was linked to his second brother, Roger, suggested that a significant portion of the Golden Group's operations fell under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, with Eric claiming allegiance to his eldest brother, Bruce, it meant that Bruce's influence had infiltrated the very underworld of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but wonder, "If even Serpent's Coil is under Bruce's control, then perhaps the entire underground world of Solomia is, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a wave of anxiety wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to inherit the Godfather's position, he needed to strengthen his own power. Mastering Ancient Martial Arts was crucial, but building his own network was equally important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, in Solomia&mdash;his own base of operations&mdash;saturated with the influence of his brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every move he made could be monitored, every decision scrutinized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't afraid for himself, but he had family and friends to consider. If any of them got caught in the crossfire, the fallout would be unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're one of my brother's men, don't blame me for what's about to happen. From today on, the underworld of Solomia will bow to me!" Marcus thought resolutely, determined to take control by first dismantling the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus lost in thought, Bob seized the moment to gloat. "What's wrong? Scared? It doesn't matter who you are; in front of Mr. Bruce Gellar, you're just an ant. Prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Bob could finish his taunt, Marcus launched a sudden punch that caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Bob had some fighting skills, he was no match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow sent him flying several feet back, his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough with the noise!" Marcus growled, his aim not to kill but to assert dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had held back his full strength in that punch. Otherwise, Bob would have long been sent straight to meet his maker!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Eric and Natalia looked on in surprise, unable to believe Marcus had the audacity to strike first against such overwhelming odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned his gaze to Eric and the others, his voice steady and commanding. "I don't care whose side you're on. You have two choices today: submit or die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's voice cut through the chaos, filled with rage. "You're asking for it, you know that? I was willing to show you mercy, to let you end it yourself and spare you some pain. But clearly, I was too lenient!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him! Break his limbs, skin him alive, and drag him back to make dog food out of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Eric's command, dozens of thugs surged forward, their faces twisted with malice as they lunged at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men were clearly tougher than the ones Bob had brought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were seasoned fighters, hardened by a life of violence, and they attacked with brutal ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, watch out!" Natalia cried, her eyes wide with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been sheltered her whole life and had never witnessed such brutality before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus shoved Natalia into the safety of the apartment, quickly locking the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned back to the fray, entering a fierce combat mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of battle erupted: thuds, crashes, and pained cries filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even bother activating the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire; he relied solely on his physical prowess and exceptional fighting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he were in a world of his own, effortlessly dodging attacks and countering with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with their weapons, the thugs couldn't touch him. Each strike from Marcus was targeted and powerful, sending one thug after another crashing to the ground, howling in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, he had taken down every last one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric, watching from the sidelines, narrowed his eyes, his expression shifting from confident to alarmed. He hadn't expected this seemingly ordinary young man to be such a formidable fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was well beyond his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll ask you one more time: are you willing to submit to me?" Marcus demanded, locking eyes with Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's face darkened. He knew he wasn't a match for Marcus but felt emboldened by the backing of Bruce. Gritting his teeth, he replied, "I might want to submit, but I need to know if Serpent's Coil will agree. And what about Mr. Bruce Gellar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you have no reason to live," Marcus said coldly, his patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out, his hand closing around Eric's throat, lifting him off the ground effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric struggled, panic flooding his eyes as he sensed the grip of death closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you dare kill me? Mr. Bruce Gellar will make you pay for this!" Eric gasped, his voice trembling with fear.</span></p><div class="pagination">
