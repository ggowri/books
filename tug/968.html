  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll just wait here," Marcus said with a casual smile, his expression calm and unbothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you must have some connections in the police system, right?" Kiera asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered that last time, when Marcus had a confrontation with Director Rollins outside the hospital, a police officer had appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that officer had just greeted Marcus before leaving with his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the way the officer acted, it seemed like he was quite respectful of Marcus, though Kiera wasn't sure about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't exactly say I have connections, but dealing with a small-time deputy police chief like him is no trouble at all," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Kiera felt more at ease. She knew that Marcus, disliking Helen's arrogant behavior, was planning to teach her a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Helen had overheard their conversation, and her round face immediately broke into a mocking grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "You loser, still spouting off, aren't you? You're nothing but a nobody, not even worth the dirt under my husband's shoes, yet you said you could handle him? Have you lost your mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you can win this young woman's heart&mdash;turns out you're just a big talker. I bet you're just some rural guy who came to work in Solomia. People like you are the scraps of society. I'm sure there are plenty of people like you around. Well, I'm dying to see how you plan to deal with my husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just Helen, but even the neighbors around them didn't believe Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their looks, it didn't seem like he and Kiera were wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they really were rich, they wouldn't be renting an old apartment; instead, they'd be in a newer place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that they were saving a few hundred bucks on rent showed how unlikely it was they could deal with the deputy police chief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this way, many of the neighbors gave Marcus a skeptical look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had initially been impressed by his confident words, but now it seemed he was just full of empty promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the sharp sound of police sirens echoed through the neighborhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Helen heard it, she knew her husband had arrived. She walked to the corner of the staircase, leaning against the narrow window to look down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her massive backside was so large that it looked almost twice the size of a normal woman's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she caught sight of the police car's license plate, Helen straightened up and turned to Marcus and Kiera, panting from the exertion of the movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she shouted, "You country bumpkin, my husband's here. Now you're gonna beg for mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect timing. Let me see what your husband can do," Marcus said with a carefree smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, he had sent a message to Amelia at the City Hall, requesting help to investigate Dexter's criminal activities and to provide assistance if necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had eagerly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Marcus rescued Benjamin in Kingston, Benjamin had grown more respectful toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had even given Amelia more authority, telling her that no matter what request Marcus had, as long as it wasn't illegal, she was required to act immediately to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of power was nearly on par with Benjamin's own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Dexter, along with a few officers, arrived at the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the neighbors saw them, they quickly cleared a path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're finally here. That tramp and her useless boyfriend beat me up and threatened me!" Helen quickly stepped forward, her face showing an exaggerated, pitiful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter furrowed his brow. His gaze followed where his wife was pointing and landed on Marcus and Kiera.</span></p><div class="pagination">
