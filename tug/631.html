  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The keen-eyed could spot that, in addition to the people inside the private room, there were several tall and imposing men standing outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A closer look revealed that these men had handguns tucked into their waists, exuding an intimidating aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's... Ms. McHale! Ms. McHale has actually arrived!" someone murmured in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many felt a shiver of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Cecilia to show up so quickly with such a formidable entourage, all armed with handguns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how formidable Marcus might be, he seemed destined to be outmatched by Cecilia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. McHale, you've finally arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Cecilia, Albert's face lit up with surprise and deep respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Cecilia merely glanced at Albert before turning her attention elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She addressed Luna. "Luna, who has wronged you? I've told you that this is not our country. You should try to keep a low profile. Why provoke trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's face contorted with grievance. "Ms. McHale, I didn't provoke anything. It's this Uswadian man who schemed against my boyfriend. I just wanted to stand up for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia sighed with a hint of exasperation, "I can help you this time, but I hope there won't be a next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being the heiress to McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, she disliked using her influence to overpower others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even more averse to causing trouble in a foreign land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her status allowed her to act with impunity in Uswad, she preferred to remain discreet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Cecilia's gaze inadvertently fell on Marcus, she was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recognized him instantly as her savior. He had saved her life when she had a sudden heart attack on the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. McHale, this Uswadian man not only schemed against my boyfriend but also hit our people. Please teach him a lesson!" Luna urged when she saw Cecilia hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Cecilia slapped Luna across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's cheek immediately turned red and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching her face, Luna looked at Cecilia in disbelief. "Ms. McHale, why did you hit me? Did I offend you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's father was the executive president of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, and to outsiders, her status was incredibly prestigious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in front of Cecilia, she was nothing more than a servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the gap in their social standing was vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prosperity of Luna's family was entirely due to Cecilia's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Cecilia's family were to remove Luna's father from his position, Luna's family would be left with nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, the man with a beard next to Cecilia explained to Luna, "Ms. McHale had a heart attack on the side of the road earlier. If it weren't for this man's intervention, she would have been in grave danger. Luna, you should not offend Ms. McHale's savior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that Marcus had become Ms. McHale's savior so unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert was also astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade had previously mentioned that even Carter admired Marcus' medical skills, regarding him as a divine healer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the time, no one paid much attention to Jade's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought she was just exaggerating Marcus' medical abilities to make him seem less ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't expect his medical skills to be truly exceptional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, a sudden heart attack was difficult to treat, and even if the patient survived, they would need a long recovery period in the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Cecilia looked perfectly healthy, showing no signs of having recently suffered a heart attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Luna and Albert were skeptical of Cecilia's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna asked doubtfully, "Ms. McHale, are you sure you're not lying? Did he really save you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia responded firmly, "I'm not in the habit of lying. Regardless of your grievances with him, I forbid you to harm him. He is my savior. Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna nodded reluctantly, though she was still resentful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watched in astonishment. The dramatic turn of events seemed like something out of a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jade couldn't help but take a closer look at Marcus. She hadn't expected him to save someone on his way to her birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert, meanwhile, was seething with resentment, racking his brain for ways to make Marcus pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he couldn't swallow his anger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
