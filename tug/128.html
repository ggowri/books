  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Julius watched Marcus chatting on the phone, a mocking grin spread across his face. He sneered, "Oh, still pretending to call my uncle, huh? Do you even know who my uncle is? He's not someone you can just reach out to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Julius, Marcus was just a pathetic loser living off women&mdash;there was no way he could have any connection to someone as accomplished as his uncle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Julius Andrade, he tends to bluff. There's no way he actually knows your uncle. Let's just wait and see who he can really summon. We can deal with him then," Abigail interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius perked up at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This could turn out to be quite entertaining, and he was curious to see how Marcus would try to bluff his way through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jake, let them go for now. We'll deal with him later," Julius ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake cast a glance at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been busy with work for Stephen, who had assigned him to oversee things at Vertex Plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen couldn't just drop everything because Julius told him to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake didn't buy Marcus's claims either; he was simply enjoying the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another group rushed over to the Chaumet counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was Stephen, the new president of Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Mr. Stephen Andrade! He's really here!" someone in the crowd exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heads turned toward Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock spread across the faces of many, including Julius, Jake, and Abigail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My uncle actually came," Julius murmured, unease creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Julius Andrade. Mr. Stephen Andrade might have finished his work and come to check on you," Jake reassured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That made sense to Julius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen had no children and had always treated him like a son, showering him with affection since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it wasn't surprising that Stephen would come running when Julius called for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Stephen arrived at the Chaumet counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Julius, Abigail, and Jake, Stephen was stunned and asked, "Julius, you're really here. What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Stephen! Someone beat me up and is pretending to call you. You have to help me deal with him!" Julius exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen's expression darkened. "Who would dare do such a thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius pointed at Marcus. "It's him! Uncle Stephen, you can't let him get away with this. It would be best if you could cut off his legs&mdash;oh, and his tongue too! He's been so mean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen's gaze turned to Marcus, and his eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dea..." Stephen started to call out but caught himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sharp enough to piece together the situation quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius was about to say something nasty when Stephen slapped him in the face. "You idiot! How dare you offend Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius stood there, stunned, a look of confusion and innocence on his face. "Uncle Stephen, this guy is a freeloader. He's Abigail's ex-husband. After she kicked him out, he latched onto Josie and kept mooching off her! You've got him confused with someone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Julius's cluelessness, Stephen slapped him again and hissed, "Shut up! If you say another word, I'll sew your mouth shut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius couldn't believe it. Stephen, who had always spoiled him, had never been this harsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake sensed the tension and stepped forward cautiously. "Mr. Stephen Andrade, Mr. Julius Andrade is saying this guy beat him up and called for you. Please try to stay calm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shut your mouth too, you idiot. Believe me, I can fire you right now!" Stephen shot back, fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why were the people around him so dense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't grasp the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they completely angered Marcus, they would all be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Stephen stepped in front of Marcus and bowed deeply. "Hello, Mr. Fitzgerald. I'm Stephen Andrade."</span></p><div class="pagination">
