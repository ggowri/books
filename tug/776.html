  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the void, that ethereal voice echoed once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. A bloodthirsty smirk crept across his face as he said, "I choose to take on three more challenges!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Marcus, these trials were more than mere obstacles. They were opportunities to grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no intention of letting such a chance slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the allure of those 24 Return Essence Crystals was impossible for him to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, skipping the remaining challenges was simply out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent. I admire your determination. But let me remind you, the final three </span><span>challenges might be harder than you expect. Are you sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ethereal voice drifted into his ears again. Marcus nodded calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, the scene before him shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself in a vast desert, with fierce winds constantly howling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ahead, fourteen figures began to emerge, their powerful auras palpable even from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The sixth challenge had six opponents, and now the seventh has jumped to fourteen? That's just insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Marcus couldn't help but let out a helpless sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could fully process the situation, the figures on the other side launched an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying, destructive handprint descended from the skies, brimming with overwhelming Rune Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That attack carried a force of </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power. It was Marcus' own signature ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to think. He was forced to enter combat mode immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had gained significant combat experience in the earlier six challenges and elevated his strength to unprecedented levels, facing fourteen versions of himself all at once was still a monumental pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every move he made had to be calculated with utmost precision. He knew there was no room for error.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dodging and weaving through the waves of destructive energy, Marcus searched desperately for an opening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sheer number of opponents left him vulnerable. Two punches landed squarely on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sent flying, blood spurting from his mouth, his face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, he retrieved two healing pills from his Spatial Ring and swallowed them, suppressing his injuries for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his fourteen adversaries showed no intention of giving him a breather, launching an even fiercer barrage of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew that despite the odds, he had to stick to the same strategy he'd used before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to defeat one opponent first. Absorb </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>power. Then take on the rest, one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked his sights on the closest figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dodging the relentless attacks from all fourteen, Marcus found his opening and unleashed a ferocious assault on his target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his growth from the earlier challenges, his current strength far surpassed what it had been before entering the trials. His opponents, however, were stuck at the level he had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his fierce attack, the targeted figure quickly began to falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the other figures weren't about to stand idly by. Their attacks rained down in an attempt to shield their ally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Marcus ignored the incoming strikes and focused his energy on a devastating Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous boom echoed as his punch tore through his target's chest, leaving a basketball-sized hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure's organs were obliterated, and they collapsed lifelessly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus twisted his body to evade as much of the retaliation as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, five attacks struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was blasted backward, his body shaking from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his defenses hadn't been strengthened in the previous trials, those attacks would have surely ended him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his injuries, Marcus felt a surge of energy as the slain figure's power merged into his body.</span></p><div class="pagination">
