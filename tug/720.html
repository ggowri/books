  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, cast an indifferent glance at Atlas, and then made a phone call. "Based on my current location, tell Hector to come and see me within ten minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas was taken aback by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Marcus knew Hector's full name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Atlas smiled sarcastically, "You are a great pretender. You actually summoned Mr. Olson to come to see you. Who do you think you are? You're seriously overestimating yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Atlas, is Hector the vice president of Bayside Petroleum Company?" Edwin asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Natalie couldn't help but look at Marcus deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that even Bayside Petroleum Company had some connection with Marcus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Natalie knew that the company was owned by Lonnie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could it have any relation to Marcus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Natalie thought about the strange deaths of Lonnie and Joan that had occurred before, a shiver involuntarily ran down her spine. Simultaneously, a guess began to form in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy previously claimed that the Golden Group belonged to him, and now he's asking Mr. Olson to come and see him. It's really quite comical. I have no idea which of his words can be believed!" Edwin mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora smiled, "It's indeed comical. He probably has no idea of Mr. Olson's identity. He actually bragged about calling Mr. Olson. I'm eager to see if Mr. Olson will show up here within ten minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Cora. I think he is just pretending. How could he summon Mr. Olson over with just a phone call? It's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin immediately denied the possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring what these people said, Marcus waited quietly there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Hector ten minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But less than ten minutes later, there was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would knock on the door so late in the afternoon? How annoying!" Edwin grumbled before running over to open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door stood a middle-aged man wearing a windbreaker and a black tie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had slicked-back hair, exuding an imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following closely behind him were several other remarkable individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were both men and women, and it was evident at a glance that they were people of significance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin, who didn't know Hector, asked, "Who are you looking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector replied cautiously, "I'm looking for Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin narrowed his eyes slightly, turned to Marcus, and asked, "Hey, you are Mr. Fitzgerald, right? Someone is here for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he still did not realize that the man standing in front of him was the vice president of Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Atlas was extremely familiar with Hector's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Atlas couldn't help but tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face suddenly darkened, and he strode over to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Hector outside the door, he immediately froze. "M-Mr. Olson, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector quickly entered the house without even casting a glance at Atlas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of the astonished stares of the crowd, he approached Marcus with an air of </span><span>utmost respect and asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, may I ask what has prompted you to summon me here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector had a clear understanding of just how formidable Marcus was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus acquired Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, his industries had extended to nearly every corner of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> and Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Hector came to the realization that the deaths of Lonnie and Joan were closely and inseparably connected to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having killed prominent figures like Lonnie and Joan, Marcus didn't face any consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fact was enough to prove his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector would never have the audacity to offend someone as wealthy, powerful, and heartless as Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Marcus now had a 100% controlling stake in Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything about Bayside Petroleum Company could be decided by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Hector's actions completely dumbfounded everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces betrayed disbelief and horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vice president of Bayside Petroleum Company, Hector had an extremely distinguished identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus actually called him here with a phone call, and Hector showed extremely abnormal respect at the sight of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a complete shock to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas, in particular, widened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Olson, who is this guy? Why is he worthy of your respect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector glared at Atlas coldly and scolded, "You have no right to speak when I'm talking to Mr. Fitzgerald. Get out of here right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas' face turned ashen. He never anticipated that Hector would be so angry with him because of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, since he met Hector, Hector had never once shown anger towards him. He was completely at a loss as to what had gotten into Hector today.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
