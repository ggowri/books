  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Solomia Special Police Academy Tactical Unit operated independently, outside Benjamin's direct authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when Brenden Wilde arrived with his team, it completely blindsided Ryder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryder, what do we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar, surrounded by hundreds of heavily armed special forces, was starting to lose his nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen such an overwhelming display of firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many guns aimed at him, the thought of one accidental trigger pull sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax. They won't dare touch me," Ryder replied, forcing a confident smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, unease crept into his thoughts. Benjamin Mitchell wasn't acting on a whim&mdash;this was a calculated move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drop your weapons immediately, or we will take action!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A commanding voice boomed from a sniper team stationed on a nearby factory rooftop, their rifles trained on the officers below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The criminal investigation officers exchanged tense glances, their faces pale. Slowly, one by one, they lowered their weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the Solomia Special Police Academy Tactical Unit, the city's criminal investigation team was vastly outmatched&mdash;not just in authority, but also in individual combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their equipment was inferior by a wide margin, leaving no room for comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, they were simply following Ryder Cromwell's orders to make an arrest. There was no way they'd risk their lives in a fight they had no chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the situation fully under control, Benjamin and Brenden made their way toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, please forgive our delay. We should have arrived sooner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in front of everyone, the two high-ranking officials greeted Marcus with an air of deference that stunned the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A political powerhouse and a military leader were speaking to Marcus with visible respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was nothing short of surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder and Oscar looked on, their disbelief written across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Oscar, who never imagined Marcus held this kind of sway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you both for stepping in," Marcus replied calmly, offering a small nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Theodore Drake, the city's chief prosecutor, stepped forward to greet Marcus with equal reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching from a distance, Michelle Smith was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since when did Marcus have such powerful allies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief exchange, Benjamin turned toward Ryder, his expression hardening. "Ryder Cromwell, do you have any idea what you've done?" Benjamin's voice cut through the air like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder sneered, his composure unwavering. "Benjamin, don't think pulling in the Special Police Academy will change anything. If you want to accuse me, show me your evidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's smirk deepened as he signaled to two officials from the Department of Justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been waiting for Ryder to demand proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officials retrieved several documents from their briefcases and handed them to Ryder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These files contain evidence of your corruption&mdash;dereliction of duty, embezzlement, bribery. Your time as Deputy Mayor is over," Benjamin said, his tone firm and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder's expression darkened as he clenched his teeth in fury. "Benjamin, you've been lying in wait all these years, gathering dirt on me. You're a snake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he let out a bitter chuckle. "Still, my advice? Shred those files while you still can. You won't like what happens if you don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's eyes narrowed. He knew Ryder's confidence came from his father-in-law, a senior official with substantial influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Benjamin had anticipated this from the very beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder Cromwell was a threat that needed to be neutralized. Without action, Benjamin's position as mayor would always be undercut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryder Cromwell, your crimes are undeniable. No amount of connections will save you now. Arrest him and let the provincial authorities handle the case!" Benjamin commanded decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Ryder's rank exceeded the city's jurisdiction, Benjamin had no choice but to escalate the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden gestured to his team, who swiftly moved in to apprehend Ryder and Oscar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benjamin, you'll regret this! You've just signed your own political death warrant!" Ryder shouted as he struggled against the officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But against the highly trained special forces, his resistance was futile. Cold steel cuffs snapped around his wrists as he was hauled into a waiting police vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar, meanwhile, stood frozen, his face pale and blank with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected his greed to spiral into a crisis of this magnitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he realized Benjamin wasn't bluffing&mdash;he was ready to burn every bridge if that's what it took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the saying goes, "When the city burns, the fish in the moat suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Ryder's powerful connections saved him, Oscar knew his own career was finished.</span></p><div class="pagination">
