  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scanned the crowd and said, "I've said it before, from today onward, the Shadow Syndicate no longer exists. Let's rename it to Death Syndicate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four high-ranking managers dared not defy his order, so they respectfully replied, "Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Hank was instantly killed by Marcus, they didn't dare to resist him any longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Thomas, who was standing not far away, was completely terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That battle was something he had only seen in movies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Marcus was no longer human, but a monster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, the person who could easily kill Hank and made the high-ranking managers of the Shadow Syndicate kneel in submission had been someone he constantly mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even earlier, Thomas had once suspected that Marcus's Aston Martin key was bought on Amazon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, thinking back, Thomas found himself both ridiculous and ignorant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Marcus did not react to his insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, killing him would definitely be easier than stepping on an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip said excitedly, "Marcus, I've decided to give Catherine's hand in marriage to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I've already told you, Marcus and I are just friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine appeared at some point. She was afraid that Philip might say something even more outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip continued, "Friends can develop into lovers, and lovers can become spouses. Since the two of you have feelings for each other, why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's a gambling addict who could marry his daughter off to whoever had money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine glared at Philip fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip didn't dare to speak anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked over at Stanley, who was not far away, and said, "Does he still need to pay back the six hundred thousand dollars to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley was so frightened that he fell to his knees, shaking his head repeatedly. "No need, Mr. Fitzgerald. It's my fault; I couldn't gauge your strength. I deserve it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Stanley kept slapping himself, fearing that Marcus would kill him on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip angrily stepped forward and kicked Stanley several times. Stanley could only endure the beating passively, not daring to say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for the hospitality, Catherine. Please convey my farewell to Laura; I'll be leaving now." Marcus bid Catherine goodbye, got into the brand new Aston Martin, and drove off, quickly disappearing into the rainy night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Marcus leave, the four high-ranking managers of the Shadow Syndicate dared to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow Syndicate was the premier underground organization in Solomia, possessing exceptional strength and controlling one-third of Solomia's underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But such a top-tier force was destroyed overnight and fell under the control of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kind of psychological shock could only be truly understood by those who had experienced it firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Order all the subordinates immediately to refer to themselves as members of the Death Syndicate. All members of the Death Syndicate must swear unconditional loyalty to Death; any violation will result in immediate execution!" A high-ranking manager of the Death Syndicate instructed his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" The man immediately accepted the order and began to relay the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this moment on, there was no longer a Shadow Syndicate in Solomia, only the Death Syndicate, and they swore allegiance only to Death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't rush to impart the Magic Codex to the members of the Death Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since these people had just submitted, he planned to observe them for a while and then quickly eliminate those who showed signs of betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was driving his Aston Martin down the rain-soaked streets of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air outside was fresh. As he gazed at the enchanting night view of Solomia, Marcus pondered over his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the phone rang; it was Michelle calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered, and on the other end of the line came Michelle's somewhat anxious voice, "Marcus, can you come pick me up? I'm at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, wait for me, I'll be there in five minutes," he said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
