  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade knew one thing for sure&mdash;if Marcus had hit Aiden, then there was no way </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital was getting its hands on that batch of special medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald, standing beside them, roared in fury. "You hillbilly! You actually dared to hit Mr. Nelson? You're finished! Just wait until you face </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Jade, spitting venom. "And you, bitch! Of all the men you could have chosen, you went with this nobody? You've ruined everything. Our partnership is over! My position as vice president is gone! A slut will always be a slut&mdash;if I ever get the chance, I'll make you pay for this!" His rage spiraled into a stream of curses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' expression darkened. "Still got a filthy mouth, huh?" Without another word, he stepped forward and kicked Ronald&mdash;twice. Ronald crumpled to the ground, wailing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden, clutching his bruised face, was helped to his feet. His gaze toward Marcus turned ice-cold. "You bastard! You actually dared to hit me? Stay right here if you've got the guts&mdash;I'll have my father come deal with you!" With that, he pulled out his phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end was none other than Finley&mdash;Aiden's father and the current president of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden's arrogance had always stemmed from two things: Finley's powerful position and his uncle&mdash;Preston's even greater influence. Preston, Kingston military's </span><span>high-ranking officer, had no children of his own and doted on Aiden like a son. This endless indulgence had made Aiden the arrogant, untouchable figure he was today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Aiden call Finley, Jade tugged on Marcus' sleeve anxiously. "Marcus, he's calling for backup. Maybe we should leave? No need to take unnecessary risks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood the power dynamics&mdash;no matter how well-connected Marcus was in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, this was Kingston, not his home turf. She didn't want him dragged into this because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus simply took her hand, his grip firm and reassuring. "Don't worry. He's no threat to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade wanted to believe him, but she couldn't shake the unease gnawing at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Aiden sneered into the phone, "Dad, bring a lot of men. This guy's tough&mdash;he took down all my people. You need to make sure he pays, and I mean really pays." He, of course, exaggerated the situation, making himself sound even more pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the line, Finley's fury surged. He thought, "My only son has been attacked? That is unacceptable. Preston and I have always treated Aiden like a prince, sheltering him from harm. No one else has the right to lay a hand on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Finley mobilized </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> entire security team and rushed toward Aiden's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hanging up, Aiden smirked at Marcus, "Hillbilly, if you're a real man, stay right here. My </span><span>dad's</span><span> on his way to wipe you off the map. You think you're tough? You messed with the wrong person. I have a hundred ways to make you disappear&mdash;even if you run, you won't make it out of Kingston alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Aiden a cold, assessing look. "Your dad's Finley, right?" He'd heard the name before, especially since he had recently acquired </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>. He just hadn't met Finley in person yet. Well, now seemed like a good opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden mistook Marcus' calmness for fear. His confidence soared. "Oh, so you do know my father's reputation? Then why were you stupid enough to cross me? You got a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden's goons started laughing, already imagining Marcus groveling when Finley arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus just chuckled, his eyes gleaming with amusement, "What makes you so sure I'm the one who should be scared? Ever considered that maybe your father should be afraid of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden froze, as if he'd misheard. A second later, he burst into laughter. "You? My father afraid of you? Do you even know who you're talking about? My dad's the president of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And my uncle, Preston, is a high-ranking military officer&mdash;he's been working closely with Kingston's special advisory department. Either one of them could crush you. And here you are, running your mouth like an idiot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Marcus raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "His </span><span>uncle's</span><span> in the military? And he works directly under the Special Advisor Department? Interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just shut up and get ready to beg for mercy," Aiden smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a luxurious motorcade approached from across the street. Leading the convoy was a Rolls-Royce Phantom with an unmistakable license plate: Kingston A22222.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd had already gathered at the restaurant entrance, drawn by the earlier commotion. When they saw the Rolls-Royce, murmurs rippled through the onlookers. "That's Finley! </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> president just arrived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone sighed, "Yeah, that young guy messed with the wrong people. With Finley here, he's done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "He must be an outsider&mdash;anyone from Kingston would know better than to mess with Finley. That guy's finished." People whispered among themselves, casting sympathetic glances at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Aiden and Ronald's faces lit up with unrestrained excitement. Aiden stepped forward triumphantly. "Hillbilly, my dad's here. You're dead. If you get on your knees and beg now, I might consider letting you off the hook. But this is your last chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the Rolls-Royce came to a halt in front of the restaurant. A chauffeur quickly stepped out and respectfully opened the door. Finley emerged&mdash;despite being in his fifties, he exuded power and authority, the kind of presence only a seasoned businessman could command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, men in black suits exited the other cars. They moved with practiced precision, each exuding an aura of danger. It was clear they were armed and ready for action. The tension in the air thickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden hurried forward, playing the victim to perfection. "Dad, you're finally here. I was humiliated today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley's gaze swept over Aiden, dark and stormy. "Who did this to you? I will teach them a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden turned, pointing a trembling finger at Marcus. His voice dripped with hatred. "That hillbilly over there. And that bitch is his girlfriend. Dad, you have to teach them a lesson. Break his limbs! And as for her&mdash;send her straight to one of our nightclubs. Make her a hostess!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
