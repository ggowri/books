  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the powerful Devouring Power, Asher gradually ceased his struggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes became dull, his skin lost its luster, and his body rapidly dried up, turning into a desiccated corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus panted heavily, horrified and feeling as if he had narrowly escaped death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight of the desiccated corpse filled him with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never imagined the Devouring Power he had just comprehended would be so potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was an expert at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Five, and his strength was much stronger than Marcus'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had he not used Celestial Reversal to seriously injure Asher, who had initially underestimated him and fought earnestly, he would have been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, Marcus managed to turn defeat into victory, devouring Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made him think of the old man who had given him the pendant three years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire was a cultivation manual he gained after the pendant merged with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If such a simple gift has this kind of power, what strength does the old man possess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After absorbing Asher's energy, Marcus felt his meridians fill with power that didn't belong to him, creating an overwhelming sense of expansion in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His abdomen was extremely full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that with some refinement, this energy would significantly enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle had been witnessed by the remaining Ancient Martial Stage Four expert of the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Marcus in horror and attempted to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, unleashed a lightning attack and killed him instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Marcus defeated all three Astral Serpent Order experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took the Spatial Rings of the fallen and returned to Asher's corpse and recalled that Asher had mentioned wearing the Silkworm Armour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This powerful defensive armor would be invaluable for his survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he searched, he found the so-called Silkworm Armour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the surface, it looked just like an ordinary silk vest and was made of silk, just like the name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could be worn casually but transformed into body armor upon attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recognizing its value, Marcus removed it from Asher and stored it in his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to clean it before wearing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, he incinerated the three corpses with his flame magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Asher dead, the rune he had set up became ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus returned to the mountain pass near the Bayside Highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mountain pass remained undisturbed, and there was no trace of fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sea breeze blew slowly, the sun was shiny and mild, and it was a quiet and peaceful scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He marveled at the power of the rune, which was capable of creating independent spaces for various activities without outside interference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides mastering ancient martial arts, Asher was also a Rune Crafter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at the Bayside Villa, Marcus intended to search Asher's Spatial Ring to see if there were any secrets about the rune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was injured and needed to heal quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without much time to think, he drove his Aston Martin toward Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in the Astral Serpent Order's large hall, Phoenix sat on a futon to cultivate, surrounded by intense energy aided by pills and runes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had finally reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six, just one step away from the Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, three loud cracks echoed from a corner of the hall before he could recover the cultivation manuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned slightly and noticed the Soul Lamps representing the lives of three individuals shatter.</span></p><div class="pagination">
