  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, breakfast is ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, he heard Diana's voice from outside the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then realized that she had gotten up early to cook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly dressed up and walked out of the room, only to see the table already filled with various dishes that seemed nutritious and tasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Jane and Pearl also walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus near the table, Jane blinked her eyes and teased him, "Honey, I didn't know you were back. No wonder there was such noise in Diana's room last night. You two were really so loud that I couldn't fall asleep for three or four hours before dawn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was serving the last plate of the dish when Jane said that jokingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pretty face suddenly turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also felt a little embarrassed, so he cleared his throat and said to Jane, "Can you stuff your mouth with these wonderful foods instead of gossip, darling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blinking seductively, Jane deliberately chested out to show off her big breasts under her black nightgown. Her snow-white cleavage was faintly visible beneath the black gauze. Marcus had to admit that among so many stunning women he had met, Jane's </span><span>breasts definitely ranked high in terms of their size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I'm just telling the truth. You </span><span>gotta</span><span> let me speak the truth out," Jane talked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, replied with a glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that he was indeed a little irritated, Jane stopped teasing him and focused on breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for getting up so early in the morning to prepare for this wonderful breakfast," he then said to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all her late work at night, she still had to get up early to get breakfast done. Her schedule might be heavier than a head of the state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Diana hadn't been a Demon Fighter, Marcus would have been so worried about her health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Receiving his gratitude, Diana blinked her azure eyes and immediately shook her head. "It's not a big deal, Mr. Fitzgerald. I'm happy about cooking for you. I really do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her considerate behavior pinched Marcus' heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This loyal girl had always been serving as his most solid shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made up his mind to successfully inherit the position of Godfather so as not to fail her loyalty and effort and offer her a wealthy and easy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes a very small thing could have a profound impact on people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, Marcus felt more obliged to achieve his goal just because of some simple words from Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Marcus was to go back to his room to practice when his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Maxine's call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately recalled this beautiful and courageous policewoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a while for them not to see each other. He occasionally contacted Maxine only through WhatsApp. Specifically, they hadn't met each other for two months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was indeed an unexpected call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said after answering the phone, "Morning, officer. I thought you had wiped me off your mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, don't you start! That's my line. We haven't met for almost six months, have we? So, you want to never call me or what?" said Maxine with resentment of not hearing from Marcus for so long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her question embarrassed Marcus as he indeed snubbed her during this busy time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he apologized, "That's not true, Officer Burnett. I have been missing you. It's just been a little busy for me these days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his apology didn't work; Maxine became even angrier and said after a momentary silence, "You mean you didn't have time? But I think you have plenty of time dating other women in Kingston. Couldn't you spare some for me? Men are all bastards, especially you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
