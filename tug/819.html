  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could imagine that a seemingly frail girl could show such incredible strength with a casual move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It defied basic physics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like something out of a sci-fi movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace looked so petite but could unleash such power. Some even thought that she was a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia hurried to Nash's side. She looked concerned and asked, "Nash, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash saw stars from the blows. Luckily, he was physically strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been an ordinary person, they might have passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash struggled to his feet and said, "I'm fine. It's just some minor injuries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teeth were almost all broken. His words were slurred, but he still claimed to be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace looked at her hands again. She was amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only now did she begin to understand her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia asked bitterly, "What should we do now? That bitch slapped you twice. Are you just going to let it go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash spat, "That bitch not only hit me but also pretended to be the Special Advisor's woman. I'll call the Special Advisor Department right now and have them deal with these two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia immediately smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that with the Special Advisor Department involved, Grace and Marcus were doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia turned back to Grace with an arrogant expression. She said, "Bitch, Nash is about to call the Special Advisor Department. Are you panicking now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Special Advisor Department has high authority. Nash said they can mobilize a whole military division. I don't know where you learned your skills, but no matter how strong you are, you can't stop bullets, can you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait and see. Once the Special Advisor Department arrives, the two slaps you gave Nash will be repaid a hundredfold. You'll both be imprisoned for life for impersonating the special advisor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia was full of pride. She still didn't realize that the Special Advisor she was talking about was standing right in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she kept talking about imprisoning him for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was proud that Nash could work with the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the onlookers looked at Grace and Marcus with pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought the same as Kenia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew how prestigious the Special Advisor was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two had messed with the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Grace hit Nash, the Special Advisor wouldn't let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the troops arrived, these two were doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash called the Special Advisor Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He briefly explained the situation, then hung up the phone with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He returned with a smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "The Special Advisor isn't here, but his secretary, Lydia, is working in the department. She'll bring people over to handle these two and send them to the military court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia felt even more pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered at Grace, "Bitch, did you hear that? This is the consequence of offending Nash. Now you can meet your father in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brought this on yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, isn't Lydia the lady we saw earlier when we left the Ritz-Carlton Hotel?" Grace asked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She completely ignored Kenia's provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, when they left the hotel, Lydia had come with the Special Advisor Department to report to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had a good impression of the female officer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a child, she dreamed of joining the military, but her poor health disqualified her. She had to give up the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "Yes, it should be her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia was Marcus' secretary in the department. Even if they came, there was nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their conversation was overheard by Kenia and Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia sneered, "I can't believe they are still pretending when disaster is looming. How can they stay so calm? Aren't they afraid of being arrested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash laughed, "Maybe they don't understand the power of the Special Advisor Department. They'll regret it when Ms. Gray arrives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia turned to Grace and Marcus again. She sneered, "You two, stay right here. Don't run. When Ms. Gray arrives, you'll be done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was amused. Back in school, she thought Kenia was clever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Kenia looked so stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything seemed clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Kenia hadn't noticed anything unusual. She continued to act as she pleased, thinking highly of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, more people gathered in the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to see how Grace and Marcus would handle the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a line of military vehicles arrived. They parked neatly in front of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People looked at the vehicles, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, look at the license plates on those military vehicles," someone said. "They must be from the newly formed Special Advisor Department. Nash wasn't lying. He really is from that department."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, these vehicles look new," another person added. "The license plates are different from other Kingston units. They must be from the Special Advisor Department."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, this is going to be interesting," someone else chimed in. "I want to see what happens to those two. They hit someone from the Special Advisor Department and pretended to be the special advisor. They deserve to be punished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant was buzzing with conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the door opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many soldiers entered. They were fully armed with heavy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their leader was a woman in her late twenties. She wore a military uniform and had a strong presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Lydia who had met with Marcus earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was now Marcus' secretary. She would not let anyone impersonate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had come immediately after receiving a report from Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to see who dared to challenge the authority of the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Gray, you're finally here," Nash said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed to greet her obsequiously.</span></p><div class="pagination">
