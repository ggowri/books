  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake could no longer tolerate Ronan and covered his nose while ordering his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone present trembled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected Blake to be so ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the two subordinates who were holding Ronan received their orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pulled out their daggers and plunged them toward Ronan's groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan let out a tragic scream, cold sweat covering his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't! My penis! No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan rolled on the ground, blood pouring out everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others were stunned with fear. They had never seen such a horrifying scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara and Selina broke into cold sweats, trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's and Kristen's faces turned extremely pale as they struggled desperately to break free, but they found it was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, the Axe Gang members continued to swing their daggers, targeting Eamon, Kristen, and Ronan's remaining body parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of knives slicing through flesh echoed continuously as all four limbs of the three were brutally severed, resulting in a gruesome sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lamborghini dealership was engulfed in the stench of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many salespeople screamed and crouched on the ground, their expressions filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara and Selina turned pale, not daring to take a breath, fearing that Blake would come after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Blake didn't even glance at the two women and directly stepped in front of Marcus. In front of everyone, he respectfully said to Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, Blake is at your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked on in shock, thinking, "Blake is actually Marcus' subordinate. This means the Axe Gang belongs to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kristen and Ronan still regarded Eamon, who was just a member of the Axe Gang, as their savior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's no wonder Marcus appeared so calm when facing Kristen and Ronan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had long been within Marcus' expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he hadn't stopped Kristen and Ronan was to watch their predicament."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Blake and coldly said, "It seems you have forgotten what I told you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake trembled, cold sweat dripping from his forehead. "Mr. Fitzgerald, the Silver Horn Order has just submitted to us not long ago. I did instruct Eamon before, but he did not follow my orders. It is my fault. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Blake so respectful and cautious in front of Marcus, Lara and Selina were shocked once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selina felt a surge of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person whom Blake was willing to submit to was actually mocked by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought Marcus couldn't afford a Lamborghini. Selina felt incredibly foolish, even wanting to slap herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained silent, merely staring at Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake knew that Marcus was genuinely angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he took a dagger from one of his subordinates and brutally chopped off his little finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed out. Watching his finger fall to the ground, Blake dared not utter a sound and endured the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene terrified Lara and Selina once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake held his hand and said to Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I severed a finger as an apology. I hope you can forgive me this time. If there is a next time, I will pay with my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he did not pay some price, Marcus would undoubtedly not spare him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will remember your promise. I hope there won't be a next time." Marcus waved his hand at Blake, signaling him to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had a basic principle for managing his subordinates: to balance kindness and severity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He treated his subordinates very well, but once they made mistakes, he would not easily forgive them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your forgiveness. I will not disappoint you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake felt as if he had received a reprieve and bowed deeply to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang members were all frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their hearts, Blake was a towering figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet in front of Marcus, the imposing Blake appeared so humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This completely shattered the subordinates' perceptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Blake took his people and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also took Eamon, Kristen, and Ronan with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was shocked. She did not expect things to end this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake's humble demeanor also astonished Natalia greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I now qualify to buy your cars?" Marcus asked the staff at the dealership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selina, immersed in shock, finally snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hurriedly nodded, her face filled with fear, saying, "Of course, Mr. Fitzgerald. I will handle the paperwork for you right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus coldly glared at Selina and said, "You are no longer needed. Get someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selina's face turned unpleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her ignorance, the commission of 100,000 dollars was gone just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her feel even more regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, thinking that Marcus did not punish her for her insult brought her a hint of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you still standing there for? Hurry up and serve Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion earlier attracted the manager of the dealership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager immediately instructed the salespeople to serve Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young female salesperson promptly began processing Marcus' paperwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dared not delay at all and maintained a humble and respectful attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, under the manager's instructions, they offered Marcus the best discounts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, the top-spec Lamborghini Aventador would cost 15 million dollars, but in the end, it was only charged 12 million dollars, almost a zero-profit sale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was a person whom even Blake greatly respected, so the manager did not dare to profit off Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the car purchase encountered some twists and turns, Natalia ultimately succeeded in getting her beloved vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Natalia drove the new Lamborghini Aventador, she felt elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already given the Sync Group orders to buy a full set of furniture and appliances and move them into Natalia's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Natalia returned Majestic Pines Estate, the furniture and appliances were already in place, and the cleaning was done. Moreover, the villa had been carefully arranged, giving it a warm feeling of home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, is this our new home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was extremely happy, looking around the various rooms in the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Yes, this will be our new home from now on."</span></p><div class="pagination">
