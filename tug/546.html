To top it off, he decisively pumped 20 billion into acquiring 100% of Stellar Entertainment's shares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His methods were bold and effective, earning the admiration of everyone around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Dorian, a seasoned business veteran, couldn't help but feel a deep, silent respect for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His efficiency and decisiveness were qualities even the most experienced businessmen couldn't easily match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here was this young man, barely in his twenties, already showing such power. It was clear he would become a major force in the business world one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian recalled how Edmund had called Marcus Mr. Death earlier, and he now realized that the same mysterious figure had once acquired Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation shook him to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few months ago, Death had spent a whopping 350 billion to acquire four emerging industry groups in Kingston. Now, that same figure was right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the others in the crowd, familiar with the business scene in Kingston, were also beginning to put two and two together, their minds reeling from the realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is there anything else I can help with? Please don't hesitate to ask. I'll do everything I can," Dorian quickly suppressed his shock and spoke, his tone noticeably more respectful than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was careful not to call Marcus "Mr. Death," </span><span>worrying</span><span> </span><span>that revealing his true identity might cause trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's all for now. You can go ahead and get back to work," Marcus said, waving his hand casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian bowed again and excused himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Th-thank you..." Lila, still in a daze, stammered as she looked at Marcus, her voice quivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to her with a smile. "I'm a fan of yours. No need to be so formal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had stayed because he had been captivated by her singing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often listened to her songs while driving, and he genuinely admired her voice, making him an authentic fan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop teasing me! If you keep this up, I'll feel even more embarrassed." Lila blushed, unable to look him in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to her earlier behavior, she felt like crawling into a hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not teasing you. I really am a fan," Marcus grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's an idea. I've just acquired Stellar Entertainment. How about you join us as one of my signed artists?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's face lit up in surprise, and she eagerly nodded. "That sounds perfect! I've always wanted to sign with Stellar Entertainment, but because of Edmund, I never </span><span>agreed. Now, I finally get my chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As your fan, it's truly an honor to sign such a rising star," Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Lila received a text message on her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she opened it, she saw a transfer of 800 thousand dollars, and the sender was listed as Stellar Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what's this about?" Lila asked, already suspecting that it was Marcus' doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've signed with Stellar Entertainment, your base performance fee is now one million per song. And that's just for one song. If you sing more, each additional song will add another one million to your pay," Marcus explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's eyes widened in shock and delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her previous performance fee was around 100 thousand per song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it had been raised to 600 thousand because the event was hosted by Sync Group, and she had been asked to sing three songs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never expected that Marcus would increase her fee to one million per song, making a huge difference in her income.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you so much!" Her eyes sparkled with gratitude. She couldn't believe her luck in meeting Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To show my appreciation, let me treat you to a meal. I hope you won't refuse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought for a moment before nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the two of them got into Lila's BMW and headed toward one of the most famous restaurants in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they drove away, a group of Lila's fans watched them enviously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was she beautiful, but she was also talented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they could only admire her from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like her could only be claimed by someone as powerful as Marcus. They envied his position, knowing they could never compete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they arrived at the restaurant and enjoyed a pleasant lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the meal, they talked about many things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was during their conversation that Marcus learned about the struggles Lila faced before she became famous. He gained a deeper understanding of just how hard she had worked to get where she was today.</span></p><div class="pagination">
