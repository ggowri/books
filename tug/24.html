  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the POS machine beeped, Catherine stood frozen in disbelief, convinced she must have misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eighty million dollars had gone through successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald really has eighty million dollars! Am I dreaming?" Catherine wondered, doubt creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To confirm her reality, she pinched herself hard enough to make her wince. The pain was real&mdash;she wasn't dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighty... eighty million dollars! This poor chauffeur actually has that kind of money? How is that even possible?" Amy exclaimed, springing out of her seat as she stared at the successful transaction on the screen, rubbing her eyes in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emilia's expression mirrored Amy's shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Marcus' age and the car he drove, he certainly didn't fit the profile of someone who could casually drop 80 million dollars on a house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more astonishing was that none of them had ever seen a card like his, yet it had actually processed such a hefty amount!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amy, we might have misjudged him. That guy really is loaded... Eighty million dollars means a commission of at least one million dollars. Just like that, it's slipping through our fingers..." Emilia said, her voice tinged with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emilia mused, "If I had known he was this wealthy, I would have been the first one to welcome him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One million dollars in commission? That's more than what we make selling several smaller villas combined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now it's going to that Catherine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine had always thought Amy was intentionally making things hard for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had approached Marcus out of a sense of duty, not expecting much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did Catherine know, the biggest deal of the year was about to fall into her lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this sale, she wouldn't just keep her job; she'd likely secure the title of top salesperson for the year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Amy was filled with regret, realizing she shouldn't have underestimated Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had been the one to engage him first when he walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the sting of defeat, Amy quickly retrieved the sales contract, swaying her hips as she approached Marcus, her previous sharp demeanor replaced by a syrupy smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I must apologize for my earlier mistake. I didn't recognize your status and mistook you for a driver. I hope you'll forgive my oversight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine is new and still learning. Let me handle the contract for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Amy tried to reclaim the opportunity she had initially let slip away, quickly scribbling her name on the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's beautiful eyes betrayed her anger. "Amy, I was the one who served Mr. Fitzgerald. How can you just take over the contract? What about the commission?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy looked up, her expression turning fierce. "Do we really need to discuss this? You're my trainee, and Mr. Fitzgerald's case was originally mine. I let you take it to give you some experience. Now that it's time to close, the commission is rightfully mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine was hailed from a disadvantaged background with a father who was a chronic gambler and had lost the family's fortune and a mother suffering from a grave illness, bedridden and in urgent need of treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her gentle nature, she mustered her courage and spoke up, "Amy, you can't do this. You know my family's financial situation, and since this is my client, the commission should rightfully be mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Amy's temper flared. She stood up and slapped Catherine hard across the face, icy fury in her voice. "You little bitch, your family issues are none of my concern! Stop wasting my time with your sob story. If you dare to challenge me again, I'll make sure Mr. Hess fires you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine covered her face, her eyes red with humiliation. The threat of being fired loomed over her, forcing her to suppress her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson Hess, the head of the real estate office, had an inappropriate relationship with Amy, which meant that her job was only a word away from being taken away by Amy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Catherine had fallen silent, Amy resumed her self-satisfied scribbling on the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a second!" Marcus' voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy was taken aback, her smile quickly returning as she said, "Is there something else you need, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want your services anymore. Get lost. If the commission doesn't belong to Ms. Wilson, then I'm out!" Marcus declared, his tone firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy's expression darkened. She hadn't expected Marcus to stand his ground like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her chances of stealing the deal slipping away, Amy snapped, "It's just a house! What's with the attitude? I'm done dealing with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning her attention to Catherine, Amy sneered, "You little bitch, you look all sweet and innocent, but clearly, you're just a little temptress trying to steal my clients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me be clear: I control this deal. If I decide you get a commission, then you do. If not, tough luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Amy dialed a number. "Hey, babe, that little bitch Catherine is trying to steal my client. You need to come over and fire her right now. And make sure her commission gets deducted too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than five minutes later, a hefty man rushed in, clearly agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catherine, you little tramp! I was doing you a favor by hiring you, but now you have the guts to steal from my wife? You've got some nerve! You're fired&mdash;get out of here right now! And don't expect to see a penny of your pay this month, including the commission on that deal!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
