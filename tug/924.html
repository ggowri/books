  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus' response, Cecilia didn't seem too satisfied and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you think I'm the most beautiful woman in </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, but what about other countries? Say, your homeland, </span><span>Uswad</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she pouted and added, "I didn't take you for someone who plays with words. You only said I'm the most beautiful in </span><span>Acoton</span><span>. </span><span>So</span><span> I guess, compared to the women from other countries, I don't even make the cut."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus watched Cecilia puffing up in frustration, he could almost feel the headache forming. He thought, "So, women from Weston Land are just like the ones in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>&mdash;they love twisting words. I was clearly complimenting her, yet she somehow managed to take it the wrong way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Letting out a deep breath, he explained, "What I meant was, to me, you're incredibly beautiful&mdash;really, really beautiful. I just didn't know how to put it into words, so I blurted out what I did."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Cecilia heard that, a satisfied smile appeared on her face. Her gaze locked onto Marcus, and for the first time, those deep blue eyes of hers carried an unmistakable warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, without warning, she reached out her hands and wrapped them around Marcus' wrist. Before he could react, she lifted his arm and placed his large palm directly on one of her juicy breasts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a brief moment, all Marcus could register was softness&mdash;full, round, and unbelievably perky. But what truly caught him off guard was Cecilia's size.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hands were already large, yet they couldn't fully cover Cecilia's breast. Instead, his palm was pushed up, unable to contain the fullness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus blinked, caught somewhere between confusion and disbelief. "Ms. McHale, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia's expression remained soft. Her cheeks now flushed a delicate shade of pink. "Isn't this what you wanted, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus opened his mouth, trying to find the right words. "I&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yes, Cecilia was stunning, and yes, he was undeniably attracted to her. But just because his eyes had drifted in that direction earlier didn't mean he had any intention of taking advantage of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no need to explain," she interrupted, gently pressing a finger against Marcus' lips. Her gaze turned even more tender. "If you want this, then so do I."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And with that, Cecilia reached for the straps of her nightgown and let them slip off her shoulders. The silky fabric then effortlessly glided down her smooth, flawless skin, revealing more and more of her stunning curves with each passing second.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her smooth, delicate chest was fully exposed, revealing the perfect curves of her full, rounded breasts. The peaks were especially captivating&mdash;firm, rosy, and irresistibly alluring. It was the kind of sight that held one's gaze, making it nearly impossible to look away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, do you really think I'm beautiful?" Cecilia asked, her face growing even redder, like a ripe apple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus replied, "I've already said it before, you are really beautiful, so beautiful that it takes my breath away." In this ambiguous atmosphere, his desire gradually stirred. He felt a fiery heat in his lower body, and a certain prominent part even became slightly erect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then... do you want to have me?" Cecilia continued, her voice grew softer, laced with undeniable seduction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus responded, "If you truly want this, then yes. But if you don't, then neither do I."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't the kind of man to force someone. Even though he had saved Cecilia's life, he would never take advantage of her. If she wasn't willing, he would rather suppress his own desires than cross that line.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't say that. From the moment you saved my life, my heart already belonged to you. And today... seeing you like this&mdash;it's burned into my mind. I admire you in a way I can't even explain. I know that without you, I'd never be able to look at another man the same way. </span><span>So</span><span> believe me, I truly like you&mdash;there's nothing fake about it," Cecilia confessed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
