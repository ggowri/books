  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">And as the police chief of this district, he had full authority to make an arrest. Even if things escalated during the process, the higher-ups wouldn&#x27;t hold him accountable. If necessary, he could always charge Marcus with resisting arrest.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was well-versed in doing this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick turned back to Marcus, his expression dark. &quot;You really think you&#x27;re untouchable, huh? You didn&#x27;t just cripple my son—you also bought out my company and kicked me out like I was nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;ve cut off every path for me and my son. If you have the guts, stay right here. My brother&#x27;s on his way with reinforcements. Let&#x27;s see how cocky you are then.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And don&#x27;t even think about running. If you do, you&#x27;ll be a fugitive. If they catch you again, they&#x27;ll add evading arrest to your charges, and you can spend the rest of your life behind bars.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">There was a triumphant gleam in Garrick&#x27;s eyes as if Marcus&#x27; fate was already sealed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The crowd exchanged uneasy glances, some nodding in agreement with Garrick&#x27;s words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As shocking as it was that Marcus had acquired Faust Properties in mere minutes, there was no denying what had actually happened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had severely injured people here—not only destroying Sebastien&#x27;s manhood but also taking down all of Garrick&#x27;s men. Some were left with broken limbs. Others were barely clinging to consciousness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This wasn&#x27;t just a case of minor assault. Even with all the money in the world, Marcus might not be able to avoid legal consequences.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Morgana&#x27;s face turned grim, and she couldn&#x27;t help but worry for Marcus. She knew that once Regis arrived with his officers, this wouldn&#x27;t be easy to settle.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her thoughts drifted to someone she hadn&#x27;t seen in years—her father. They had cut ties over personal matters and hadn&#x27;t spoken to each other in nearly three years. But for Marcus&#x27; sake, she was prepared to swallow her pride and make a call.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had no doubt that if she reached out, her father would still be willing to help her. The only problem was that doing so would mean reconnecting with her family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before she could dwell on it any longer, the distant wail of sirens cut through the air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The tension in the crowd spiked as all eyes turned toward the approaching convoy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Within moments, over a dozen police vehicles came speeding down the road, stopping right in front of the Solomia Institute of Technology&#x27;s dormitory for female students.</p><p style="text-align:left;">From the lead car stepped out a stocky, graying man with sharp, piercing eyes. There was no mistaking the resemblance—he looked just like Garrick. This was Regis, the police chief of Solomia&#x27;s Westpine District.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As the car doors swung open, officers armed with firearms poured out, swiftly taking formation. Their movements were precise, their gazes sharp, awaiting Regis&#x27; command.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick&#x27;s face lit up with relief as he rushed forward like a drowning man clinging to a lifeline. &quot;You&#x27;re finally here!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Regis&#x27; expression was grim as he scanned the scene, his gaze landing on Sebastien&#x27;s battered form on the ground. His eyes narrowed, and a dangerous glint flashed through them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick knew this look all too well. Whenever Regis got like this, it meant someone was about to face hell.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Who did this to him?&quot; Regis asked, his voice dangerously calm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The sheer weight of his presence sent a palpable chill through the air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick pointed straight at Marcus, his voice laced with rage. &quot;That bastard right there. He&#x27;s trying to wipe out the Faust bloodline. You can&#x27;t let him walk away from this!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Regis didn&#x27;t hesitate. He gave a sharp signal to his officers. At once, they moved in, surrounding Marcus with guns aimed directly at his head.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The sight sent a wave of shock through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick might have lost his company, but his connections still held power. With a brother like Regis, he could pin any charge on Marcus and make his life a living hell.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marcus might have money, but against the law—against a man like Regis—wealth alone wouldn&#x27;t be enough. He had underestimated the Faust brothers, and now, it looked like he was about to pay the price.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Regis&#x27; voice cut through the silence like a blade. &quot;Take him in.&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
