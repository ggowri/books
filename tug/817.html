  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was always kind and forgiving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kenia had insulted her, she might have tolerated it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kenia insulted Marcus and Benjamin, Grace couldn't tolerate that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "My dad was framed. Besides, he will be out in three days. It was Marcus who saved him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia was visibly surprised. She asked Nash, "Is what she said true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash immediately showed a disdainful smile. He said, "I already told you. Benjamin was imprisoned by Pablo. He can't get out easily. Do you believe he was saved by this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia smirked, "Grace, did you hear that? You're trying to trick me. It's not funny at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you, my boyfriend, Nash, is a major. His father is a military commander. Now, he has been assigned by Commander Ashford to do important work in the Special Advisor Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he gets promoted by the Special Advisor, his future will be limitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, do you know how powerful the Special Advisor is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few days ago in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, the Special Advisor was incredibly brave. He saved Commander Ashford's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that battle, he was like a god. He killed more than a dozen foreign mercenaries hidden among the crowd. Every shot was fatal. Commander Ashford personally promoted him to the rank of major general. He became the Special Advisor of the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military. His record is even more impressive than Battle God Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nash is about to work with the Special Advisor. If you really want to save your dad, beg him. Ask him to plead with the Special Advisor. Maybe your dad still has a chance. Otherwise, he might be in jail for life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia's words immediately drew the attention of people in the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The incident on Sixth Avenue in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, where a man killed more than a dozen foreign mercenaries, spread in the form of rumors on the internet and became a viral topic despite the authorities' efforts to block the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were familiar with that legendary figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On military forums, he was regarded as a new legend, being worshipped by countless military enthusiasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Kenia mentioned that Nash was about to work alongside that man, many people cast envious glances at Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash displayed great pride, feeling honored to work with the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said smugly, "I can work with the Special Advisor because of my father's connections and my abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Special Advisor's status, he only needs to say a word to save Benjamin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia also smiled proudly. She said to Grace, "Did you hear that? Nash can be your savior. If you beg him, saving your dad won't be difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kenia and Nash's self-important attitudes, Grace and Marcus exchanged a glance. They both found it strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't understand why people could be so self-important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace took a deep breath and asked, "What is the name of that Special Advisor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash thought for a moment and said, "What a coincidence. The Special Advisor is also named Marcus. But </span><span>Uswad</span><span> has nearly 1.5 billion people. Many people have the same name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia didn't find anything unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nash said, many people in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> shared the same name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't connect Marcus with the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as Nash finished speaking, Grace said, "Let me tell you, he is the Special Advisor you mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My father was saved by Marcus. He will be out in three days because of some paperwork."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was always low-key. If Kenia and Nash weren't so self-important, she wouldn't have revealed Marcus' identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be flaunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia and Nash both laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their laughter was full of mockery. They looked at Grace with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, you mean he's the Special Advisor? Don't joke. It isn't funny at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With his looks, he dares to impersonate the Special Advisor? Just because he shares the same name, do you think he can pretend to be the Special Advisor? What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Kenia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's words also attracted the attention of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked at Grace with mocking eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Special Advisor held such a prestigious position. Not anyone could impersonate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some fans of the Special Advisor began to attack Grace with words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed she was insulting the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash said coldly, "Since you're Kenia's classmate, I thought maybe I could help you plead with the Special Advisor to rescue your father. But now, it seems there's no need for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at him. Just because of the same name, he dares to impersonate the Special Advisor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia seemed to have remembered something and quickly interjected, "I know why she dares to let him impersonate the Special Advisor. It's because you can't find any photos of the Special Advisor online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one knows what the Special Advisor looks like, so she dares to do this with no fear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash nodded, agreeing with Kenia's reasoning. He said, "Don't think that just because there are no photos of the Special Advisor online, you can take advantage of the legal loopholes. Let me tell you the truth. He's impersonating the Special Advisor, and he could be convicted. If I report him, we can arrest him at any time. A sentence of 10 or 8 years isn't impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement had a certain degree of provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as it was said, it quickly gained the support of the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Special Advisor was the new legend in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, admired by countless people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he protected the safety of </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> high-ranking leaders, but he had also restored </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> reputation in the international community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a figure was truly legendary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wouldn't allow anyone to impersonate the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Grace's actions were intolerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many began to speak in support of Nash, condemning Grace and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia said, "Grace, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and beg Nash to forgive you. Otherwise, just for impersonating the Special Advisor, you two could end up in serious trouble."</span></p><div class="pagination">
