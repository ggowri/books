  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the people Landon brought with him paid no heed to Patrick's pleas for mercy. In front of everyone present, they directly severed Patrick's arms. Blood poured freely, and Patrick, drenched in cold sweat, screamed in agony. His face was contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at the stumps where his arms used to be, despair and regret overwhelmed him. If he had known Marcus' true identity, he never would have dared provoke Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He certainly wouldn't have been so arrogant when Marcus arrived. But now, it was too late. His arms were gone, and the rest of his life would be spent as a cripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone here gasped in shock. The gruesome scene made cold sweat run down their faces, and some women let out terrified screams, their faces turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon, however, didn't pay attention to any of that. He walked straight up to Marcus and bowed deeply. "Mr. Fitzgerald, is this enough? I've dealt with him severely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus give Landon a brief glance and say, "Keep your Whitman family under control. Don't let them flaunt their status wherever they go. If I catch wind of it again, I'll wipe the Whitman family off the map."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus had said something like this before, many would have mocked him. But now, no one dared to speak out. Even Landon had admitted, with his own mouth, that Marcus was someone Valentin couldn't afford to cross. If members of the Whitman family continued to provoke Marcus, it really could mean the end for them. What else was there to question?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, rest assured. I'll make sure to discipline them when I get back properly. They won't cause any more trouble. If it happens again, I'll cut off one of my own arms as an apology," Landon sighed with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, he had feared that Patrick's stupidity might drag the entire Whitman family down with him. "Take him away and deal with him severely," Landon then ordered his men to carry Patrick off, his arms severed, and drag him to the car. After exchanging a brief word with Marcus, Landon left Kingston University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac was dismembered in Uswad. Please send someone to kill the perpetrator and avenge him." Almost at the same time, the Griffin member beside Isaac dialed the phone of the Griffin family in Crankhurst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had shown impressive status and authority, the Griffin family remained unaffected. This was a display of their unwavering confidence in their own standing. After hanging up, several others approached and quickly carried the dismembered Isaac away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone had left, Luke approached Marcus with a nervous bow and apologized, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I deeply apologize. I had no idea of your esteemed status. If I've offended you, please forgive me." If even Landon had shown such respect, Luke feared that if he didn't apologize, he might lose his job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast a cold glance at him and said, "As head of security, you should act fairly and justly. Your actions earlier have embarrassed Kingston University."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Luke would have been furious at such words, but now, he bowed his head and listened intently, not daring to argue. He nodded repeatedly, respecting Marcus' authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left everyone at Kingston University stunned. They all knew Luke's usual attitude around campus. With his small position, he had often walked around with his nose in the air, acting like he owned the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in front of Marcus, he was like a completely different person&mdash;humble and respectful&mdash;an absolute contrast to his previous arrogance. It was the classic behavior of someone who only knew how to bully the weak and fear the strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Luke had believed Marcus had no real status, no background, and no strength to back him up. But now, knowing Marcus' extraordinary identity, he had immediately changed his tune, bowing and scraping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such people always go whichever way the wind blows. They're just like fence-sitters, blowing whichever way the wind tells them. But Marcus didn't bother to pay any attention to him. He simply turned and left, taking Natalia by the hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus walked away, someone in the crowd couldn't help but whisper in shock, "Who is this guy? He's so powerful that even Landon, heir to the Whitman family, is terrified of him. What kind of person has such an identity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs reflected the thoughts of everyone present. They had all come to watch the spectacle, never expecting to encounter such a powerful figure. Marcus, however, paid no attention to the gossip, holding Natalia's hand as they left Kingston University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, why didn't you tell me you were at Kingston?" Natalia asked, looking at him with a smile. Seeing how commanding Marcus had been earlier, Natalia's admiration for him only deepened.</span></p><div class="pagination">
