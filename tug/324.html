  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Tony's name, everyone present couldn't help but shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That name was nothing short of a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For years, they had been unable to escape his shadow, living under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their meager monthly earnings were mostly swallowed up by protection fees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some had thought of moving out of there and tried to get as far away as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was futile. As long as they didn't leave Solariae, anyone who had lived in the slum would eventually be found by Tony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Threats and harassment were inevitable. For those residing in the slum, escaping Tony's influence seemed impossible in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fleet of vans pulled up near Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A burly man with a crew cut, broad shoulders, and a thick gold chain jumped out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was followed by a group of younger men, exuding an imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Vito, that's the guy! He beat us up and even had the nerve to demand your presence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tattooed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony's gaze shifted to Marcus, his eyes flashing with disdain and mockery. "Kid, you must be new around here. Clearly, you don't know the rules of the slum. You dare offend the people of the Black Tiger Gang? Do you have any idea what's going to happen to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Tony and his men advanced toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were hundreds of people, each with a gleaming machete in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing beside Tony were two men in black suits, each with a pistol tucked at their waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Witnessing this scene, the slum's residents and vendors didn't dare utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew this was only a fraction of Tony's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Tony's eyes, dealing with an ignorant outsider didn't require more than these men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cut the crap. I order you not to harass the people and vendors of this slum from now on and stop collecting protection fees. If you don't comply, you will only die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't be bothered to waste words, issuing a direct threat instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony and his men seemed to think they had misheard him. They froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a burst of mocking laughter broke out. "Mr. Vito, this kid must be scared out of his mind! Talking to you like that. Where the hell does he get the nerve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speaker was a gangster standing beside Tony with a pistol in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As this gangster spoke, he raised the gun, ready to aim at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus lifted a finger, and a burst of Numinous Energy shot forth like a streak of destructive light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, with a sickening sound, a hole the size of a bowl appeared in the gangster's forehead, and he collapsed to the ground, dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene instantly stunned everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had seen clearly how Marcus did it, yet he had effortlessly taken a life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! You dare kill one of our men? I'll turn you into a sieve today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another gangster shouted, unable to hold back, raising his weapon alongside others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!" Tony suddenly commanded, waving his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gangsters froze, confusion written on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony stepped forward and said to Marcus, "I didn't expect you to be a warrior. My apologies for underestimating you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, under the astonished gazes of many thugs, Tony bowed deeply to Marcus. "We, the Black Tiger Gang, were blind and offended you. Please, don't hold it against us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The request you made earlier, I will comply without question!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony's sudden change in attitude left his men utterly bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them, still unable to understand, asked hesitantly, "Mr. Vito, this guy killed one of us, and yet you're treating him with such respect? We have over a hundred men here, all at your command. No matter how strong he is, how could he possibly handle so many of us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could finish, Tony slapped him across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The slap left that man's mouth bleeding. "Didn't you hear me? I've already made a promise to this gentleman. If you dare speak again, I'll break your jaw!" Tony yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene made that man tremble again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, he was not used to seeing Tony this furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The slum's residents and vendors were equally shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, Tony was a ruthless killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Never had they seen him act so polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Listen up! This gentleman here is someone I respect. I've decided we will no longer collect protection fees from the slum. If anyone dares question me, they're going against me directly. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony turned around and spoke to those gangsters. Although he tried to suppress the fear in his heart, his forehead still oozed cold sweat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
