  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' Dual Cultivation kicked in, Josie's sense of bliss doubled instantly. She was enveloped in waves of pure happiness, and her moans grew more and more intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey... I'm about to... You gotta go faster... Make me feel good... I feel so good..." Josie wrapped her long legs around Marcus' waist, her body writhing, trying to guide his thrusts to hit that one sweet spot deep inside her for even more intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just hold on," Marcus said, feeling a sense of accomplishment seeing Josie so happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he picked up the pace, thrusting harder and faster than before. The intensity was so much that Josie's eyes rolled back, and she reached her second climax under one of his powerful thrusts. This time, her body convulsed even more violently, and a surge of liquid spilled out, soaking a large area of the bedsheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, you're really reactive," Marcus teased, seeing Josie's exaggerated expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathing heavily, Josie replied, "I... I just missed you so much. That's why I'm reacting so strongly. Honey, don't make fun of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "I wouldn't dream of it." As he spoke, he flipped Josie over and entered her from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This position allowed for deeper penetration, and with the increased intensity, many women would struggle to keep up. Josie was no exception. Under Marcus' fierce assault, she started begging for mercy, her body nearly collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While thrusting, Marcus unleashed his Dual Cultivation, using their intimate moment to boost his own abilities. He realized that since breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Stage, his Dual Cultivation power had become significantly stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It not only gave his partner more intense pleasure but also noticeably improved his own cultivation. Even though he and Josie had practiced Dual Cultivation many times before, this time, Marcus could feel an effect that was many times stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie also reaped great benefits from it. Marcus had previously taught her magical power, but perhaps because of her busy work schedule, she hadn't truly reached the Wizard Stage One until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Marcus' Dual Cultivation, while she was experiencing endless pleasure, her magic level had directly broken through to Stage One. She became a Stage One Wizard in the midst of her ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Stage One Wizard, Josie was now set apart from ordinary people. She would have some ability to protect herself in dangerous situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Josie's body convulsing around him, Marcus soon reached his own peak of desire. He couldn't hold back any longer, grabbed Josie's legs, and went into a final frenzy of thrusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he felt a jolt of electricity, his body convulsing as he released everything deep inside Josie. He vaguely remembered that she had been taking long-acting birth control pills recently, so he could freely pour his semen into her without any worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving Marcus' semen, Josie seemed extremely satisfied. Her body trembled as she lay on the bed, still panting heavily. It took her a while to fully come to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're so naughty... I told you I have to go to a class reunion, and you still did this to me," Josie said, her face flushed, and she gave Marcus a playful glare when she woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Marcus completely baffled. Women's minds were really hard to guess. She was the one who wanted it, but now that she was satisfied, she was blaming him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were just loving it, telling me to go faster and harder. How can you turn around and act like this so quickly?" Marcus said with a smile, not understanding what she was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie quickly covered Marcus' mouth. "Honey, don't say anything more. It's so embarrassing. Don't talk about it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow but dropped the subject. "How's your magic training going?" he asked instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's face showed a hint of embarrassment. "Business at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals has been so busy lately, and with taking care of Leia and her grandparents, I haven't had much time to practice magic. I still haven't broken through to the Stage One."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Try casting a spell now," Marcus suggested with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's eyes sparkled as she attempted to channel her magical power. A bolt of lightning appeared, quickly striking a nearby office desk. The next moment, with a loud crack, the heavy desk split right down the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was utterly shocked, her hand flying to her mouth in disbelief. "When did I become this strong? Honey, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Josie had tried to cast spells, but the lightning and fire she produced were only good for show, unable to cause any real damage to objects. Now, her bolt of thunder was incredibly powerful, which was just mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a Stage One Wizard now. It's perfectly normal to have this kind of power," Marcus explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was still extremely shocked, her eyes sparkling as she looked at Marcus. "How did this happen? I haven't been practicing lately. How could I have broken through on my own?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that you broke through on your own. You just practiced Dual Cultivation with me. It's all thanks to that," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's face turned red instantly. "Honey, you're just teasing me. How could we be practicing while doing that? That's impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "I told you before, but you didn't listen. Haven't you noticed that in the past couple of months, when we're together, it feels way better than before? That's all thanks to the Dual Cultivation power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dual cultivation power not only gives us ultimate pleasure but also helps us improve our abilities at the same time," Marcus continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Josie was even more astonished. She couldn't believe there was such a magical power in the world, and Marcus was the one who controlled it. She remembered that Marcus had mentioned something like this before, but she hadn't taken it seriously back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're amazing. I love you so much. We can actually practice and improve while having fun. I'm really afraid that other women might take you away from me," Josie said, planting a kiss on Marcus' cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intimacy they just shared had given her a sense of pleasure she had never experienced before. She felt like she was still floating on air, unable to get enough of that cloud-like feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was certain that even a woman who didn't feel anything for Marcus would become addicted to him after being with him just once, like having a drug addiction. This feeling was unimaginable unless they experienced it themselves. For a woman who loved Marcus deeply like her, it was even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before meeting Marcus, Josie had always been indifferent to romantic matters, never letting herself think too much about them. Even if she did, she could easily suppress those thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ever since she met Marcus, she found she couldn't hold back anymore. Even if she tried to satisfy herself, it only made her feel more empty. Only when she was with Marcus could she truly fill that void.</span></p><div class="pagination">
