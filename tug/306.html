  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Allan, and he said, "The facilities at Builder Market are outdated, and the business model can no longer keep up with current trends. That's why the company has been suffering losses year after year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here's the deal. I'll allocate 100 million Uswadian coins to you. You have one year to transform the Builder Market and turn it profitable. Do you have confidence in this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan was taken aback. He never expected that Marcus had the authority to allocate funds to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made him even more curious about Marcus' identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan replied, "I'm confident. If I can't do it, I'll resign as general manager myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good, the 100 million Uswadian coins will be transferred tomorrow. You can start thinking about your plans now." Marcus smiled as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus then turned his attention to Dylan, who was still keeping his head down. "I don't have any other matters to attend to. If you don't have anything else to discuss with me, you can go back to what you were doing. But remember, don't make the same mistake again. Otherwise, I can take your chairman position anytime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan felt as though a heavy burden had been lifted upon hearing Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly stood up and bowed to Marcus. "I'll keep Mr. Fitzgerald's advice in mind. If I make the same mistake again, I'll automatically step down as chairman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan finished his words and left with his bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan and Lisa were at a loss for words and looked at Marcus with gratitude in their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you truly are a savior to our family. I don't even know how to thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick's eyes welled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The events of the day had entirely shattered my preconceived notions about Marcus." thought Nick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria was also trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand. "As I've said, we're family. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to reach out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have other matters to attend to, so I won't stay here any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he nodded at Richard and his wife before leaving Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, whether it was treating Nick or promoting Allan to general manager of Builder Market, it was all just a matter of a few simple gestures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he saw potential in someone, he never hesitated to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After leaving Solomia Hospital, Marcus headed to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina was waiting in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she saw Marcus, she rushed into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're finally back! I sent you a message, but you didn't reply. I was so worried about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina hugged Marcus tightly as if afraid he would disappear if she let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There were some unexpected matters. I got delayed; don't mind it," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I was away for three days, which is a bit long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But I had no choice. I ran into Elder Dupont from the Astral Serpent Order, and after a battle with him, I had to take three days to heal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm returning to Kingston tomorrow. Can you stay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina asked, her voice full of tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't leave. I'll take you to the airport tomorrow," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina beamed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That night, of course, was filled with indescribable intimacy and passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't stop until he shared a private moment with her five times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By morning, Melina was utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She almost couldn't get out of bed the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, Ian was an excellent driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Driving Melina's Ferrari 720s, he navigated through traffic and ensured that she made it to the airport in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The airline Melina chose offered car shipping services and allowed her to send her car back to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After seeing Melina off, Marcus returned to Bayside Villa to rest for the night. The next day, he took the high-speed train to Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Solomia was only about 124 miles away from Solariae, the train took just an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus clearly remembered that when he first came to Solomia from his hometown, he had also taken the train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, as he sat on the train again, memories of the past flooded back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, don't rush me. I'll be there soon. Even if you keep pushing, it will still take me an hour to get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting next to Marcus was a young woman in her twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girl had long, flowing hair, a slender figure, and delicate features. Her fashion sense was impeccable, and she carried a faint scent of perfume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked like the perfect image of a modern city woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus remembered she had also boarded the train at Solomia's train station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girl ended her phone call, and the name displayed on her screen caught Marcus' attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It read: [Robert Cooper]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What was odd was that the girl had saved her father's full name as Robert Cooper on her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, I knew that a surgeon at Solariae Hospital was also named Robert Cooper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus opened his contacts and pulled up Robert's number, only to find that it was the same number as the one on the girl's phone!</span></p><div class="pagination">
