  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them would get married sooner or later, and they would also consummate the marriage eventually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser couldn't understand why Gertie refused him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, they had a big fight over that matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Gertie left the Kinton Mountains to visit the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was separated from Gertie, Yasser truly realized his mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Ada, the saintess of the Celestial Arc Order, Gertie was a well-known chaste and virtuous woman in the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she didn't want to sleep with him, but she wanted to save herself for their wedding night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl's first time often meant a lot. If a girl casually gave away her first time, she definitely wouldn't be worth cherishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser knew that he was extremely lucky to have found a fianc&eacute;e as self-disciplined as Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't appreciate his luck and quarreled with Gertie about that matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could even imagine how disappointed Gertie must have been with him at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie, I know you're here. Please come out. I won't make such a request again. I'm really sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Yasser thought about it, the guiltier he felt. He regretted having treated Gertie like that in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what he didn't know was that while he was regretting it, Gertie was having a good time with another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had set up an illusion rune in the surrounding area, Yasser's shouting still reached inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Gertie heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's body suddenly trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She desperately tried to struggle free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus didn't give Gertie any chance. He pressed his body against Gertie's and thrust wildly, and while doing that, he also sucked on her huge bosoms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie couldn't help but let out moans. She endured the pleasure coming from her lower body and said, "My fianc&eacute; is here. Let me go... I'll be damned if my fianc&eacute; sees us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she said these words, Gertie felt a pang of pain and a deep sense of guilt toward Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when she thought of the big fight she had with Yasser because she refused to sleep with him a few days ago, Gertie's sense of guilt became even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if he's here? No matter who comes, they have to wait until I'm done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said indifferently, his tone domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hated most being interrupted when doing a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, without waiting for Gertie to continue, Marcus started a more intense round of thrusting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's face turned ugly. She had never expected that Yasser would come to find her at such a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to get up, but then she felt Marcus' even more ferocious attack, giving Gertie's lower body an extremely intense sense of stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, she had an orgasm again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie, I know you're here. Why don't you come out and see me? I've really realized my mistake. I hope you can give me a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Yasser's voice sounded from the outside world again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this voice, Gertie felt like her heart was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the intense pleasure coming from her lower body left her longing for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also wanted to go out and meet Yasser, but at the moment, she was beneath Marcus and couldn't move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she could only let him continue, and the private part of her lower body had already been flooded with moisture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one hand, her fianc&eacute; was waiting outside, and on the other hand, Marcus was bringing her intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was put in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser shouted for a while, but there was still no response from Gertie. With an ugly expression, he asked Devon beside him, "Devon, are you sure that Gertie is in danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devon's eyes flickered, and after thinking for a while, he said, "I'm not sure. There is another possibility. Ms. Leah is currently in an illusion rune. So we can't detect her trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it must be a mysterious kind. Otherwise, with our cultivation state, we will surely detect it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
