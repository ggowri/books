  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening thud rang out as Edmund's arm was hacked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed in all directions, and he let out a piercing scream, his face contorted in agony and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, standing nearby, gasped in horror, her eyes wide with terror. Tears streamed down her face as she realized how far they'd fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going!" Blake's voice rang out, cool and unbothered, as if he were simply giving another order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew full well that for the crimes Edmund had committed, losing just one arm wasn't nearly enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang members immediately got to work, their machetes flashing in the dim light as they took down the rest of his limbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood pooled on the </span><span>ground,</span><span> the air thick with the metallic scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd around them was paralyzed with fear. Many women had covered their eyes, too horrified to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund passed out from the pain, his body going limp as he fell into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake turned to </span><span>Marcus,</span><span> his expression unreadable. "What should we do with the woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake hadn't touched Tina yet, but the look in his eyes made it clear what he was planning. Marcus nodded, as though he'd already expected this. "Do what you want with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and his men grinned eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina wasn't just any woman. She was a rising star in the entertainment world, and her looks had turned heads all around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the Axe Gang members had fantasized about getting close to her. Now, they finally had their chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take her away. Bring her with us," Blake ordered with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina cried out in desperation as she was hauled toward a nearby luxury SUV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew what awaited her, and her heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No amount of struggling could save her now. She was powerless, forced to accept whatever came next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake gave Marcus a respectful nod. "Mr. Fitzgerald, if there's something else, we'll take our leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded </span><span>back,</span><span> his expression unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd come here expecting to meet Blake, and now that he had, there was no need to stick around any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Blake and his men left, they left behind the grotesque scene of Edmund's dismembered body, sprawled in the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was still in shock. No one could have predicted that the once-powerful Edmund would meet such a brutal end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but wonder about Marcus' identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila, standing nearby, was frozen in place. Her face was pale as she tried to process </span><span>what she had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... you actually know people from the Axe Gang..." she </span><span>murmured,</span><span> her voice barely audible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shrugged nonchalantly, a slight smile playing on his lips. "It's not that I know them... I own them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in shock. Though his words were simple, they carried immense weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had made Dorian bow to him with a single call, the same one who had forced the Burnett family to pull their investment and then easily acquired Stellar Entertainment for 20 billion, was also the secret mastermind behind the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a level of power Lila had never even dreamed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard whispers about powerful figures in Kingston, but someone like Marcus, legendary, untouchable, was beyond anything she had ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here he was, standing before her. Her mind was racing, her heart unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you eaten yet?" Marcus asked, casually glancing at her. "Let's go once you're ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila, still in shock, nodded absently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned and began walking toward her car, and she followed, almost in a trance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if by accident, she stumbled, her ankle twisting painfully as she hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp, agonizing pain shot through her, and she grimaced as her ankle began to swell visibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spun around at the sound of her fall, his eyes immediately scanning her injuries. "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I twisted my ankle. It hurts so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus moved to her side, his hands gently but firmly lifting her off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scooped her up effortlessly and carried her to the car, opening the passenger side door and placing her carefully in the seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were inches apart, and for a moment, Lila could feel the heat radiating off him. Despite the pain in her ankle, her heart fluttered at the closeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slid into the driver's seat and started the engine, pulling away from the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My performance is tomorrow..." she muttered under her breath, irritated. "And now this happens. Great...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you taking me to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' </span><span>gaze</span><span> briefly lingered on her swollen, bruised ankle. "The hospital won't be able to fix it right away. I know a quiet place that can help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila blinked, clearly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words implied he could do something to make her better on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't shake the thought. "Is he lying? A quiet place? What does he mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind raced with possibilities, and despite her unease, she felt an odd sense of anticipation building up inside her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
