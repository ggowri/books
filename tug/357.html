  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his way to the pharmaceutical park, Benjamin couldn't help but reflect on the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that, as the mayor of Solomia, he'd be racking his brain to figure out how to handle a young man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the blaring of police sirens cut through the air outside the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city's criminal investigation unit had deployed dozens of officers, swarming into the industrial park with swift precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armed with guns, the officers surrounded Marcus, every barrel pointed squarely at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To an outsider, it might have looked like they were dealing with a dangerous, cold-blooded criminal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't just the police&mdash;prosecutors from the city's legal office had also arrived in force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a large-scale operation hadn't been seen in Solomia for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left Michelle frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that what was supposed to be a routine inspection would escalate to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of regret washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted ever involving Marcus in this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By offending Ryder Cromwell, it seemed Marcus was about to be charged with espionage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Mayor Cromwell, the criminal investigation unit is in position and awaiting your orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged officer in his forties snapped a sharp salute to Ryder, his face full of deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apprehend this foreign spy and hand him over to the prosecutors," Ryder commanded with a grand wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Deputy Mayor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer responded immediately, signaling to his team to move in and detain Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice rang out from the direction of the park's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder's face darkened as he turned to look, only to see Benjamin striding toward him with several government officials in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryder Cromwell, what do you think you're doing? Planning a coup?" Benjamin's tone was icy, cutting through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder's expression shifted briefly before he let out a sarcastic laugh. "Mayor Benjamin, shouldn't you be hosting foreign delegates right now? What brings you here to meddle in my affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your affairs? I'm the mayor of Solomia. Everything in this city falls under my jurisdiction," Benjamin replied, his tone unusually commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin was known for his calm demeanor, rarely showing the imposing authority he now exuded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder was taken aback but quickly recovered, a mocking smirk creeping across his face. "Mayor Benjamin, I suggest you stay out of this. This man must be apprehended. If you interfere, it'll only embarrass you&mdash;and none of us want that, do we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words dripped with thinly veiled threats, making it clear he wasn't about to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying you're refusing to follow the mayor's orders?" Benjamin asked, his voice sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder sneered. "I've made myself clear. This man will be arrested, no matter what. Even if someone from Kingston comes, they can't stop me. Besides, the criminal investigation unit answers to me, not you. Mayor Benjamin, you'd be wise not to humiliate yourself further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder's arrogance was on full display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though technically Benjamin's subordinate, Ryder showed no respect for him. His confidence stemmed from his powerful father-in-law, whose influence allowed him to act with impunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, really?" Benjamin's laugh was cold as ice. "So, the police and prosecutors are here. What if I told you this entire park is now surrounded by my people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder froze, disbelief flashing across his face. "Mayor Benjamin, don't be ridiculous. The city police and criminal investigation unit are under my command. What could you possibly use to surround the park? This is absurd!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryder Cromwell, this is the Solomia Special Police Academy Tactical Unit. The industrial park is surrounded. Drop your weapons and surrender immediately, or bear full responsibility for the consequences of any further escalation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Ryder finished speaking, a booming voice rang out over a loudspeaker from outside the park. It was Brenden Wilde's commanding tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the sound of heavy, synchronized footsteps echoed as a wave of special police officers closed in on the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder's face turned pale as he instinctively looked up. To his horror, not only was the industrial park surrounded, but the rooftops of several factory buildings and other vantage points were occupied by special police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armed with assault rifles and sniper gear, every officer had their sights locked squarely on him, Ryder Cromwell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Brenden Wilde, the head of the Solomia Special Police Academy, and Theodore Drake, the city's chief prosecutor, strode into the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder's face twisted with fury and disbelief. He never imagined that Benjamin would go to such lengths to protect a young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bringing in the Special Police Academy's Tactical Unit was an unprecedented move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though based in Solomia, the academy reported directly to the central government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its tactical unit was typically only deployed for major crises, rarely collaborating with the city's police force.</span></p><div class="pagination">
