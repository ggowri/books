  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been over a month since they last saw each other, and Marcus couldn't help but notice how much more alluring Josie had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women in their early thirties like her had a unique charm&mdash;a blend of maturity, sophistication, and elegance that exuded the aura of a successful woman. This only intensified Marcus' desire to conquer her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about putting on makeup," Marcus said softly, looking at Josie's delicate face. "You're thinking about whether to be with me first before you even bother with your makeup. I know you missed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this not through guesswork but through thought reading, a skill that allowed him to access people's fleeting thoughts without expending any Numinous Energy. It was both useful and fascinating, and best of all, it came at no cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's cheeks flushed even more as she glanced deeply into Marcus' eyes. "Honey, I feel like I have no secrets in front of you anymore. You can guess everything about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Josie began to actively respond, her longing for Marcus having built up over the past month. Her thoughts of him grew more intense at night, sometimes driving her to use a vibrator to ease her loneliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the temporary pleasure never truly filled the void inside her. Instead, it only made her feel emptier afterward. The moment she sensed Marcus' strong masculine presence, Josie was overwhelmed with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled, her eyes filled with desire, and without hesitation, she reached into Marcus' pants, gripping and stroking his growing erection. "Honey, you're so big... so hard... I've missed you so much," Josie whispered, kissing Marcus while helping him take off his shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' well-toned, bronze muscles were now more defined after his physical transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he wasn't a professional bodybuilder, his physique exuded strength and masculinity, making Josie almost dizzy with attraction. She took one of his nipples into her mouth, causing Marcus to let out a muffled groan and his erection to stand even more firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could react, Josie had already pulled down his pants, revealing his impressive size. She took him into her mouth and began to suckle vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa," Marcus couldn't help but gasp, his body trembling slightly. The sensation was so intense that he almost climaxed on the spot. Josie continued to suckle, teasing him with her tongue, driving Marcus' desire to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you were right. I do want you. I want you to make love to me. I can't stand it anymore. Please, hurry up and take me," Josie said, her face flushed with desire as she removed her nightgown, revealing her flawless skin and ample breasts. Marcus couldn't restrain himself anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Josie had a baby, her body was just as stunning as that of a teenage girl, if not better. Marcus' hands immediately found their way to her breasts, kneading them firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie let out a high-pitched moan, her body electrified by the touch. Her lower body grew wet as Marcus took her other nipple into his mouth, teasing the sensitive nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie clung to Marcus' head, her body instinctively seeking closer contact. Marcus lifted her and placed her on the vanity, tearing off her black lace panties to reveal her glistening, intimate area. He began to caress her, his touch sending waves of pleasure through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... Honey, I can't take it anymore. Please, stop teasing me like this. I can't handle it," Josie pleaded, her body trembling with every touch. Marcus' fingers found her most sensitive spot, and with just a few strokes, she was on the verge of climax. Her body released a flood of moisture, filling the air with her unique, feminine scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back any longer, Marcus positioned himself and thrust into her. Josie felt her emptiness finally filled, and she let out a high-pitched cry. She looked at Marcus with a mix of longing and desire. "Honey, it's been over a month. It feels like you've grown even bigger. Am I just imagining things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled but didn't respond. Instead, he began to thrust, his movements powerful and rhythmic. As Josie had noticed, his size seemed even more impressive after his transformation, and his hardness was like steel. Each thrust sent Josie into waves of pleasure, and within minutes, she was trembling and climaxing for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus increased the intensity of his thrusts, the sound of their bodies colliding filling the room. "Honey, listen to that... those are the sounds of my desire. You're making me so wet," Josie said, her face flushed with embarrassment and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped her legs around Marcus' waist, pulling him closer. Marcus lifted Josie's hips, changing the angle of his thrusts to reach even deeper into her. Josie's moans grew louder, her body writhing with pleasure. "Honey, you're making me feel so good. I can't take it anymore. Don't stop. Go faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally laid Josie down on the bed and took control, thrusting into her with even greater force. Josie felt like she was floating on a cloud, waves of ecstasy crashing over her. Her body was covered in a sheen of sweat, and the sound of their lovemaking filled the room like a symphony of passion.</span></p><div class="pagination">
