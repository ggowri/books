  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the phone, Noel entered his membership number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, he was attended to by the dedicated customer service team assigned to black diamond members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black diamond membership represented the pinnacle of the brand's membership tiers. Considering Noel's expenditure, he was on the verge of securing a spot among the top ten spenders in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> that year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the brand, customers like Noel were of utmost significance. As soon as he voiced his complaint, the customer service team sprang into action to handle it without delay and promised to reply to him within half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Noel hung up, Hadley immediately asked, "Noel, what did the brand's customer service say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "I've just discovered that my spending last year had already landed me in the top ten in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. They're taking my complaint extremely seriously and promised to get back to me within half an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley immediately became excited and chuckled, "I knew it. With your membership level, let alone a mere store manager like her, even if you complain about a store, it will have to shut down for a few days for rectification."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but frown slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, Natalie had worked with a woman like Hadley for several years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though young and beautiful, Hadley was ruthless and scheming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she growled with a smug expression, "Natalie, this is the consequence of your attempt to take my boyfriend away. Noel is devoted to me. No matter how much effort you put in, you won't be able to win him over, and now you're in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will lose your position as store manager. Do you regret what you did before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie gazed at Hadley and Noel in a strange way and said, "I stepped down as the store manager an hour ago. There's no point in you lodging a complaint against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Hadley asked subconsciously, "Are you no longer the store manager? Did you resign? Were you fired or demoted because of some mistakes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie smiled, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley let out a scornful laugh. "I can't believe that even now, Natalie, you're still up to your tricks. I'm sure you're devastated right now. Go ahead and cry if you want. When I snatched away your opportunity to work in Kingston, you burst into tears. You can just act like you did back then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie ignored her, turned to Marcus, and said, "Marcus, people always said that I was a bit off before and that there were all sorts of oddities about me. Actually, after I spent years working alongside someone like her, it would be strange if I could be normal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "We're all shaped by those we're close to. The environment matters a great deal. There are times when you start out as one sort of person, but when you're the odd one out among those you interact with regularly, you'll inevitably transform into someone else. This is a really crucial point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's precisely why numerous individuals are eager to socialize within certain circles and even strive to insert themselves into groups that aren't naturally theirs. Sure, building connections is part of it, but more significantly, being in a more elevated social stratum can serve as a powerful motivator, pushing them to progress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation between Marcus and Natalie wasn't overly laced with sarcasm, yet Hadley's brows knitted together tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley snarled icily, "Natalie, what are you talking about? How dare you taunt me? You are in trouble now. Believe it or not, I will make sure you can't even be a shop assistant. Then, you'll be left to starve and thirst!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie glanced at her again and asked, "Hadley, I don't understand why you are so confident that I will be demoted by the brand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley snorted, "Noel is the highest-level member of the store, and he is from the Ortega family in Kingston. Have you heard of them? They are the first of the four major families in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. It's utterly pointless to share this with someone as low-class as you. You have no opportunity whatsoever to interact with people of this caliber. And there's no way you could possibly fathom just how powerful they are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus appeared to have reached his breaking point, unable to endure the haughty demeanor of the woman before him any longer. He then stated, "It's true that the Ortega family from Kingston ranks first among the four major families. However, the Ortega family is further divided into direct and collateral branches. He's not among </span><span>the people I've ever interacted with. I'd wager that he's, at most, a member of a distant collateral branch. A man like him has no real connection to the direct branch. How dare he act so presumptuously outside, relying on the reputation of the Ortega family? Doesn't he fear that the direct branch will deal with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's brows instantly knitted together. However, instead of flying into a rage right away, she turned her gaze towards Noel and asked, "Noel, is what he's saying actually true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened. He never expected that Marcus could guess his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he remained proud and said, "Despite coming from the collateral branch of the Ortega family, I'm still immeasurably above a lowly individual like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, his words suggest that he has come into contact with many people from the Ortega family. This is a bit too ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone in the Ortega family is of noble status. There's no way we'd have any dealings with someone from a small place like </span><span>Solomia</span><span>."</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
