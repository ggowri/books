  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered, his lips curling into a cold smile. "I'll be right here waiting. Let's see what kind of freaks you can bring to the party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then casually found an empty bench, sat down, and began to wait, as if nothing could faze him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry, his face pale with fury, scrambled to gather his men and quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian wiped the blood from his lips and approached Marcus with a look of concern. "Mr. Fitzgerald, Jerry's uncle is the head of the Solomia city government office. He's a powerful man. After what you did, he won't let this slide. We should leave now, before things get any worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Ramona and Kiera, the two sisters, walked over, their faces etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera spoke up, her tone serious. "Darian's right, Mr. Fitzgerald. Jerry's no slouch. Good men know when to walk away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus merely chuckled, his gaze unwavering. "Head of the government office, huh? If he's brave enough to come after me, he'll learn quickly that his time as a government official is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words hung in the air, and the three of them exchanged nervous glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Marcus had proven to be more powerful than they had expected&mdash;able to casually part with billions without flinching&mdash;Director Rollins wielded an enormous amount of influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, Marcus had just severed Rollins' nephew's hand. There was no way Rollins would let that go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus quickly dialed Michelle, asking about any business dealings between Golden Group and Director Rollins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He learned that Rollins' son, Jaxon, had secured a position at Golden Group due to some underhanded dealings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Rollins frequently tried to sabotage Golden Group's efforts, and during the holidays, Michelle personally arranged for expensive gifts to be sent to him&mdash;gifts worth no less than a million dollars each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This had crossed the line into corruption, something Marcus had also confirmed with Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On top of that, the Department of Justice had begun quietly investigating Rollins, already holding significant evidence of his crimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This matched what Aniya had hinted at, and the pieces of the puzzle were starting to fall into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, a convoy of official vehicles sped toward their location, halting on the side of the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Director Rollins, wearing a business jacket and exuding an aura of authority, stepped out of a Toyota Coaster. Though in his fifties, his thinning hair and gold-rimmed glasses didn't diminish the commanding presence he carried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beside him, Jerry, whose arm had been bandaged after Marcus' attack, scowled with murder in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they approached, the distant sound of sirens broke the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of uniformed officers disembarked, and Director Rollins waved his hand in command. The police quickly surrounded Marcus and his group, their presence suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uncle, this is the guy who cut off my arm. You can't let him get away with this!" Jerry's voice was cold, his words laced with a thirst for vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then turned to Marcus, sneering, "You actually dared to wait here for me? Well, today's the day you're going to rot in a cell for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Director Rollins' voice was calm, but carried an undeniable authority. "This man is charged with intentional harm. Officers, arrest him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the officers moved to take action, Dustin Lloyd, a seasoned detective, raised his hand to halt them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Director Rollins shot him a sharp look, clearly taken aback. "Captain Lloyd, why haven't you made the arrest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dustin looked at him, his tone polite but firm. "I'm sorry, Director Rollins, but I can't arrest this man. I can't afford to make an enemy of him. You may want to find someone else to handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Dustin waved his hand, signaling to the officers to disperse. They quickly fell in line and withdrew, leaving the scene in an uneasy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dustin's decision wasn't one made lightly. He had crossed paths with Marcus before, not long ago, during the chaos at the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation had escalated quickly, drawing the attention of the mayor and the vice mayor, not to mention the special forces from the Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scale of it all had been staggering. Every official present had treated Marcus with the utmost deference, as if he were a man beyond reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For someone like Dustin&mdash;an experienced but relatively low-ranking detective in the grand scheme of things&mdash;to take action against a man like Marcus would have been unthinkable. He vividly remembered the air of power and influence Marcus exuded that day. Even Mayor Benjamin, the most powerful man in Solomia, had been forced to show him respect. And here was Dustin, a mere captain, standing in front of him. It wasn't just about hierarchy; it was about survival. The kind of power Marcus had wasn't something you simply challenged without understanding the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Understanding that Marcus would never willingly reveal his true identity, Dustin chose to leave the situation unresolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave no further explanation, simply turning and signaling his men to retreat. The police, reluctant but obedient, followed his lead without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the officers dispersed, Director Rollins' face darkened, clearly frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's face twisted with rage. "Uncle, what are we going to do? Lloyd's pulling back&mdash;are we just going to let this guy go free?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rollins' expression hardened. "Don't worry, Jerry. You're the only nephew I have. I won't let you suffer like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He made another call, his tone turning icy as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, is this Mr. Orion Webb? It's Director Rollins. I need a little... assistance. There's someone here who needs to be dealt with. I'd appreciate it if you could come over and help me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, Director Rollins' confidence seemed to surge. "Don't worry, Jerry. Mr. Webb from the Death Syndicate is on his way. After Marcus chopped off your arm, I'll have him dismembered."</span></p><div class="pagination">
