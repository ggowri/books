  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the sight, everyone's hearts pounded violently. No one had ever imagined&mdash;even in </span><span>their wildest dreams&mdash;that Marcus' strength had reached such a terrifying level. Joel, in particular, furrowed his brows even deeper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel knew all too well how powerful Axel was. Axel was an advanced fifth-generation cyborg&mdash;far beyond what even some of the strongest warriors, wizards, or metahumans could handle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet now, Axel had lost an arm in front of Marcus with almost laughable ease. Joel couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of fear, wondering, "Just how powerful was Marcus, then?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel wasn't the only one shaken. Cecilia, standing right beside Marcus, had an even clearer view of what had just happened. Her heart trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, suddenly, it all clicked. She pondered, "That explained why Marcus had been so calm this entire time. With the kind of </span><span>strength</span><span> he just showed, he could've fought back when he was captured in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. Hell, he could've even killed that ponytailed bastard right then and there!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So that means... Marcus really did let himself get caught on purpose&mdash;just like he said&mdash;to help me wipe out Uncle Joel and the rest of the rebels. To solidify my position as the rightful head of my family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As these thoughts sank in, Cecilia felt a wave of shock wash over her&mdash;but alongside it, a deep sense of gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She and Marcus had only met twice. If she were being honest, they were barely more than acquaintances. Sure, he had saved her life once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even in a situation like this, he had still chosen&mdash;without hesitation&mdash;to stand by her and help her. Something deep inside Cecilia softened at that thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus swept his gaze over the two men in front of him before letting out a cold, mocking laugh. "I thought you two were going to keep hiding like cowards forever. Didn't expect you to be this eager to die. Fine, I'll grant your wish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Marcus said that, another wave of unease rippled through the crowd. A lot of people still believed that he had only managed to cut off Axel's arm because he'd caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They figured that if it had been a fair fight, there was no way Marcus could've taken him down so easily. Hell, some even wondered if Marcus could have won at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, he was up against two fifth-generation cyborgs&mdash;both even stronger than the last one. Yet he still had the audacity to make such a bold declaration? That was either arrogance or sheer stupidity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, the two cyborgs had mocking smiles. One of them sneered, "You </span><span>Uswad</span><span> people always preach about humility, but I don't see a shred of it in you. If you want us dead, then come on&mdash;show us what you've got!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the fifth-generation cyborg spoke, the surface of his body morphed in an instant, sprouting multiple massive gun barrels. A split second later, a hail of oversized bullets tore through the air, all aimed straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These bullets packed a punch far beyond anything available on the market. Their power was on par with armor-piercing rounds&mdash;meaning that even if Marcus had been encased in tank-grade plating, it still wouldn't have been enough to withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gasps filled the banquet hall as panic erupted among the guests. People scrambled for cover, afraid of getting caught in the crossfire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus? He just let out a sneer. Instead of retreating, he lunged forward. Shadow Step propelled him through the barrage, his figure flickering like a mirage as he weaved through the storm of bullets.</span></p><div class="pagination">
