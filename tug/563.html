  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry. It's okay now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently stroked Josie's hair, his touch comforting her like a calm breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she felt his strong arms around her, Josie finally allowed herself to relax, the tension in her body starting to ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you need to leave. Those guys, they kidnapped me because they wanted to kill you. I don't want to drag you down with me," Josie said, her voice trembling as memories of the Black Hawk Legion flooded her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Marcus sticking around made her uneasy&mdash;those men were dangerous, and she feared that if Marcus stayed any longer, he'd be walking straight into a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," Marcus said, his voice calm but chilling. "I've already taken care of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile tugged at his lips as he spoke, his eyes glinting with a dangerous fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Hawk Legion had made a fatal mistake by going after Josie&mdash;going after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a line they shouldn't have crossed, and now they were paying the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie froze. Her eyes widened in shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen firsthand how formidable the Black Hawk Legion was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't just armed with guns&mdash;they had heavy artillery, helicopters, tanks, you name it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power was something that no ordinary person could even fathom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Marcus was claiming to have wiped them all out? It didn't make sense. But looking into his eyes, Josie knew he wasn't lying. He had done it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she trusted him with every fiber of her being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus leading the way, they exited the Black Hawk Legion headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie had braced herself, but even then, the sight of the dead bodies strewn across the ground hit her like a punch to the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to process&mdash;impossible, even. She couldn't wrap her head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could one person have done all this? The sheer scale of destruction was beyond her comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, Marcus had magic. She shouldn't have been surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside, Marcus casually cast a Firebolt, sending a stream of flame that engulfed the entire building, reducing it to ash in seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus, this wasn't just revenge&mdash;it was justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Hawk Legion had been nothing more than a criminal organization, causing chaos and bloodshed across the globe. They were a weapon for </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, targeting the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military and anyone else who got in their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world would be better off without them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the flames died down, Marcus and Josie boarded a private jet, making their way back to Kingston without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of the Black Hawk Legion's headquarters being destroyed spread like wildfire across </span><span>Acoton</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwaves hit the upper echelons of </span><span>Acoton's</span><span> government hard, igniting a firestorm of anger and outrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple, while the Black Hawk Legion was technically just a mercenary group, it had been sanctioned and secretly supported by the </span><span>Acoton</span><span> elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The government had used the Legion as a tool for carrying out operations too sensitive or risky for official forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Missions like stealing classified information from the </span><span>Solomia</span><span> data archives&mdash;something the government couldn't risk having tied to them directly, as it could jeopardize international relations or even spark a war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Legion doing the dirty work, they had the perfect deniability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Hawk Legion was a blade the </span><span>Acoton</span><span> government kept sheathed, ready to strike at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, that blade had been shattered. In their own territory, the Black Hawk Legion had been wiped out&mdash;obliterated. To the </span><span>Acoton</span><span> government, this was more than just a loss; it was a direct slap in the face, a challenge to their authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't care. International relations and diplomacy had nothing to do with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only concern was his own boundaries. If anyone dared cross that line, no matter who they were, he would make them pay dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Josie had moved into Flourish Manor, a secluded, luxurious estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had brought her home and immediately set to work healing her wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him an hour, but by the time he was finished, Josie's physical injuries had all but disappeared, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you feeling?" Marcus asked, his voice soft but serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm better physically," Josie replied, her voice quiet, a shadow crossing her face. "But my mind... that's another story."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you need?" Marcus pressed, concern evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that being kidnapped by the Black Hawk Legion must've left scars far deeper than any physical wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emotional recovery would take time, if it ever came at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked up at him, her eyes searching for comfort. "Baby, just hold me. If you hold me... I'll be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was almost a whisper, sweet and fragile. Before Marcus could respond, Josie was already in his arms, pressing herself against him. She kissed him gently, the softness of her lips speaking volumes of the vulnerability she still felt.</span></p><div class="pagination">
