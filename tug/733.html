  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, keep your eyes on the road. What are you doing?" Natalie gave Marcus a disapproving look, though there was a hint of playfulness in her expression that only made her more captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand began to rub Natalie's sensitive spot more rapidly. Each movement caused Natalie to experience a wave of excitement that she had never felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... so good." She let out a gurgling moan sound, and her skin became flushed red, becoming even more tantalizing. Soon, that soft mysterious spot moistened. A hot stream surged and soaked Marcus' finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This also made his fingers smoother, making it easier for him to go in and out. The sensitive spot in that mysterious slit seemed to firm up at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fingers just wantonly tweaked it a bit, and Natalie couldn't bear it at all. A more intense high-pitched cry came out of her mouth, and her body trembled as if she was electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Natalie reached her first organism, and her mysterious slit contracted crazily, causing Marcus' finger to be wrapped very tightly around her. His fingers were even restricted from freedom. It was obvious how strong Natalie's organism was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, stop teasing me. I can't take it anymore. Please focus on driving, it's not safe," Natalie said between breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and said, "How about we pull over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it sounded like a question, Marcus didn't actually give Natalie a chance to respond. He turned onto a side street that led behind the night market to the warehouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warehouses were busy during the day but deserted at night. Marcus parked in a secluded spot and turned off the engine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie couldn't hold it any longer. She rolled over on Marcus, lowered her head and kissed Marcus passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Natalie kissed him, Marcus felt like he was in heaven. Marcus didn't understand why, when he first reunited with Natalie, he thought he disliked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet when they were together, he felt an unprecedented satisfaction. Perhaps it was the childhood memories&mdash;he had been infatuated with Natalie back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now as adults, though that infatuation had been buried deep inside, once rekindled, he found unparalleled joy with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie kissed Marcus with abandon, and Marcus was all too eager to match her intensity. His hands found their way to Natalie's breasts, firm and inviting. He massaged them gently, his fingers teasing her nipples, which were already hard with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each touch sent Natalie into a euphoric haze as if she were soaring above the clouds. Her body felt weightless, and a warmth spread between her legs, growing more intense with every caress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he kissed her, Marcus slowly pulled down Natalie's light-colored dress, revealing her smooth, radiant skin. Her breasts were full and perfectly shaped, not quite as large as Hadley's, but every bit as captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way her bra cradled them created a beautiful curve that Marcus couldn't resist. He leaned in, his tongue tracing the soft skin, and inhaled the sweet, intoxicating scent that made his head spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The urge to be closer was overwhelming. Marcus carefully unhooked her bra, revealing her breasts in all their glory. Her nipples were delicate pink, and he took one into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie let out a soft gasp, feeling a jolt of pleasure shoot through her body. Her hips instinctively moved against him, her desire growing more intense with every touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat between them was palpable, and Marcus could feel the dampness from her body seeping through his thin clothes. He couldn't hold back any longer and, with a swift motion, tore off her underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie let out a surprised yelp. "Marcus, you're being so rough. You just tore my panties. What am I supposed to wear later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't paying any attention to her words. His hands slid under her, gripping her firm, rounded bottom and lifting her up. He positioned himself and thrust into her with a sudden, powerful motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a soft, muffled sound, followed by Natalie's sharp cry. At that moment, Natalie felt completely filled, the intense sensation of fullness making her gasp and pant uncontrollably. Her body arched, and she clung to him as waves of pleasure coursed through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus began to move, his thrusts steady and deep. Each one sent a jolt of pleasure through Natalie, the friction against her most sensitive spots driving her wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus continued, his hands wandered up to her breasts, his fingers teasing her nipples. Natalie's body writhed beneath him, her moans growing louder with each touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for her to reach another climax, her body convulsing with pleasure. </span><span>Her inner muscles clenched tightly around him, and her wetness began to spill onto the car seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' movements grew more intense, his thrusts deeper and more forceful. At the same time, Dual Cultivation intensified their pleasure, making the experience even more electrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie felt so overwhelmed with ecstasy that she almost blacked out. Marcus, feeling the need for a better angle, gently rolled them over so that Natalie was beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reclined the seat, and her legs naturally parted, revealing her glistening, swollen core. Even in the dim light of the car, the creamy fluid glistening between her thighs was unmistakable, giving Marcus an even stronger urge to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrust into Natalie again, this new position allowing him to reach deeper within her. Every movement sent waves of pleasure through her entire body, making her sensitive nerves tingle with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're incredible. I feel so good. You're so hard... I can't take it anymore," Natalie moaned, her body moving in perfect sync with his, her inner muscles tightening even more around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt an intense pleasure he had never experienced before, as if every thrust was meant to fill her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, the car was filled with the sounds of their lovemaking, creating an almost symphonic atmosphere of passion. This intense, intimate moment lasted for </span><span>one and a half hours</span><span>, until finally, with a series of violent shudders, Marcus released his climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was one of pure bliss as he filled Natalie, who experienced another powerful climax, her fifth peak. This time, she felt as if she had lost all consciousness, lying back against the seat, gasping for breath, completely drained of energy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
