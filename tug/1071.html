  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne had caught snippets of Marcus' conversation with Lydia, and a sneer formed on his lips as he scoffed, "So, from what I'm hearing, you're planning to investigate my father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, utterly unfazed, replied, "I don't have time for pointless conversations with you. Just wait for the news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne's smirk deepened, filled with mockery. "You may be the head of SiliconWave Technologies, but do you seriously think you have the power to take down my father? Do you even know who you're up against?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, Marcus' phone lit up with a message from Lydia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The report was clear&mdash;after a thorough investigation, they had uncovered numerous violations committed by Magnus during his tenure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just minor infractions&mdash;serious offenses, including embezzlement, bribery, and abuse of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was enough for immediate dismissal and a full-scale investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing left was for the Customs Bureau to issue the official order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this confirmation, Marcus looked back at Thorne and said indifferently, "Save your breath. In less than five minutes, you'll get the news that your father has been removed from office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne burst into laughter, shaking his head in amusement. He had to admit, Marcus was a fantastic actor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he said it, with such conviction, almost made it sound believable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Thorne didn't know his father's power firsthand, he might have actually fallen for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, your boyfriend is hilarious," Isolde sneered. "Does he really think he can get Thorne's father fired? What a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as her words left her mouth, Thorne's phone rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression stiffened. His father was calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just spoken a few minutes ago&mdash;why was he calling back so soon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a sudden sense of unease, Thorne hesitated before answering. "Dad, why are you calling again? What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A trembling voice came from the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I've been dismissed and placed under investigation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne froze, his entire body stiffening. His mind blanked out completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What did you just say? Say it again&mdash;I didn't hear you clearly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice shook uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Magnus' voice, still trembling, repeated, "I said, I've been dismissed and placed under investigation. It's over, Thorne. Our family is finished. Everything is gone... and the increased tariffs on SiliconWave Technologies? Forget it&mdash;that's not happening anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Thorne heard every single word, loud and clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face drained of color, turning an ashen gray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body collapsed onto the couch, completely limp. His eyes stared ahead, empty and lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. No&mdash;this can't be happening. My dad has been a Deputy Director for years. How could he just get fired so easily? What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trembled as he spoke, trying to convince himself that this was all a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation took hold as he redialed his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, do you know who did this? Who was behind it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Magnus replied, "They said it was the military. I don't know the details, but I heard a man named Fitzgerald was involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne's entire body went rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head snapped toward Marcus, his eyes filled with horror and disbelief. His voice shook as he stammered, "You... you're with the Uswad military?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire room fell silent. Eulalia and Isolde were utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If learning that Marcus was the head of SiliconWave Technologies had been shocking, then hearing that he was somehow connected to the military was downright surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This completely shattered their perception of reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could one person be both a billionaire tech CEO and a high-ranking military figure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two worlds had nothing in common. They had always believed that business and the military were entirely separate.</span></p><div class="pagination">
