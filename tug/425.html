  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ramona, I told you! I knew Darian's luck would turn around. You and Mom didn't believe me. You both always thought he was too incapable," Kiera said, looking at Ramona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of the three women, only Kiera seemed to be truly objective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona's eyes flickered, and her heart felt heavy with guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought back to all the times she had doubted Darian, even planning to divorce him not long ago. Now, with everything that had changed, she couldn't help but feel remorseful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking back on their five years of marriage, Darian had always been dedicated to his work, doing whatever it took to support their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He worked late into the night, waking up at four or five in the morning, barely getting more than four hours of sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On top of that, he took care of their son. What kind of man could anyone possibly ask for more than that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she heard that Darian had become a millionaire, Aniya's attitude shifted dramatically. Her eyes became flatter, more calculating. "Darian, I'm sorry, I was wrong about you. Please, don't hold it against me. You and Ramona have a good life together. I won't bring up divorce anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian nodded at Aniya, knowing she was nothing more than a fair-weather friend, always opportunistic and sharp-tongued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Ramona's sake, he tolerated her faults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Cal's condition had been cured by Marcus, Darian was planning to help Cal with the discharge procedures tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps it was the fact that Darian had come into money, but Aniya's attitude toward him had completely changed. That night, she volunteered to take care of her grandson for the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona and Kiera didn't object, leaving Aniya at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them, along with Marcus, walked out of the hospital doors together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a convoy of cars rolled up in front of the hospital. The lead car was a sleek, black Mercedes S-Class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The door opened, and out stepped a tall, impeccably dressed man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man's name was Jerry Rollins. He was the nephew of Director Rollins, the cousin of Jaxon, and the owner of a well-known nightclub in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry had made his fortune not only with the club, but also through his connections in Solomia's city government, making millions of dollars annually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On top of that, he also dabbled in high-interest loans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The 100 thousand dollars Darian had borrowed came from Jerry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Darian saw Jerry, he immediately walked over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jerry, here's the 100 thousand dollars I owe you," Darian said, handing over the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry gave Darian a quick, dismissive glance, a sneer playing at the corner of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for the fact that Ramona was married to Darian, Jerry wouldn't have even spared him a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, what's this? You don't need the money anymore? All of a sudden, you're flush with cash?" Jerry taunted, his tone dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's lips curved into a tight smile. "Yeah, I don't need it anymore. The guy I crashed into won't be asking me for compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, since you no longer need the money, paying me back the 100 thousand dollars still isn't enough. I'm charging you interest for today," Jerry sneered, his eyes briefly scanning Kiera, who stood next to Ramona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze lingered with a clear, greedy hunger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jerry, how much interest are we talking about? I'll pay you right now," Darian gritted out, trying to control his rising anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, interest wasn't charged unless a loan was extended for more than a day, but Jerry was clearly trying to make things difficult for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, however, wanted to clear up this mess as soon as possible, even if it meant swallowing his pride and agreeing to whatever Jerry asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For just half a day, I'll give you a discount," Jerry said with a mocking grin. "You can pay me 100 thousand dollars in interest. That'll make the total 200 thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's face went pale at the figure. "100 thousand dollars for half a day's interest? Jerry, that's way too high!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's smile faded, his expression turning cold and cruel. "Too high? If you think the interest is too much, maybe you should've thought of that before you borrowed money from me. Don't like the interest? Don't come to me for a loan next time. Now, if you don't come up with 100 thousand dollars in interest, the amount due tomorrow will be 200 thousand dollars. You'd better think this over before you come crawling back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's face turned a deep shade of red, his anger bubbling up, but he knew he couldn't confront Jerry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He understood how dangerous Jerry was&mdash;this man had deep connections in the local underworld and wasn't someone you crossed lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A confrontation could end badly for Darian, but it could also put Ramona, Kiera, and even little Cal in harm's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ten billion Uswadian coins in his account wasn't his&mdash;it belonged to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So the money Jerry was asking for? Darian didn't have it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With gritted teeth, he forced himself to speak, "Jerry, 100 thousand dollars is way too much. I can't come up with that. Is there any way you can lower it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before Darian could finish his plea, Jerry slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're a fucking joke. You don't have the cash to pay the interest, but you still have the nerve to borrow from me?" Jerry's voice was a low growl. "Here's the deal. If you can't pay the 100 thousand dollars, then send Kiera over to me for the night. I'll forgive the interest, and we'll call it even."</span></p><div class="pagination">
