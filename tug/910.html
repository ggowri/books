  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want nothing more than to make these ungrateful traitors pay right now, but we're their prisoners at this point. We can barely protect ourselves, let alone deal with these backstabbers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out another heavy sigh, her voice tinged with resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' face lit up with a confident smile as he responded, "Ms. McHale, I told you before. As long as I'm around, Joel won't get his hands on the position of family head. That position belongs to you, and today, I will help you clear every obstacle in your path, including those two-faced snakes who've been stabbing you in the back while pretending to be on your side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus' unwavering confidence, Cecilia felt a flicker of hope despite herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she quickly squashed that spark of optimism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, over ninety percent of the people in this banquet hall had already pledged their loyalty to Joel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had completely turned their backs on her, the eldest daughter of the McHale Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like sharks smelling blood in the water, they were all too eager to turn on someone who was down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia glanced at Rhett sitting in the main seat, her heart heavy with sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Marcus and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you don't need to try to comfort me. I've already prepared myself for the worst. As long as they don't harm my grandfather, </span><span>I can accept not being the family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for you, if I voluntarily step down from the position and do everything I can to ensure your safety, they won't move against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't worry, Mr. Fitzgerald. Even if it costs me my life, I won't let them drag you down with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking these words, Cecilia fixed Marcus with an intense gaze, her eyes full of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia hated dragging others into her problems, especially Marcus, who had saved her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel, Tobias, Luna, and Albert approached where Cecilia and Marcus were standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel's lips curved into a smirk as he said, "Well, well, Cecilia. When you left the McHale family for </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, did you ever imagine it would come to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words dripped with smug satisfaction and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the victor, Joel had every right to gloat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia fixed Joel with an icy stare and replied, "Uncle, I'll keep this brief. To the victor go the spoils. You've won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can't understand why you plotted so ruthlessly to take the leadership position from your own family. Have you forgotten the McHale family's ancestral teachings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel let out a harsh laugh. "Family? When did you ever treat me like family? Why were my children always overlooked in the McHale household if we were family? You never once considered me part of your inner circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave everything I had to the McHale family, only to watch my children cast aside. What's the point of living like that? I'm a direct descendant of the McHale bloodline, and if we're talking legitimacy, my claim is more substantial than yours as a mere woman. So don't question my right to lead this family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia angrily trembled as she confronted Joel, "Uncle Joel, how dare you speak like that! I gave your children a golden opportunity by offering them important positions in the family business, but what did they do? They became nothing but bullies, throwing their weight around and harassing people in public. They've tarnished the McHale family's reputation by abusing their status as direct descendants. How could I possibly trust such people with power again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued intensively, "Let's talk about the McHale family. Where would McHale Pharmaceuticals Group be without my father's hard work? We wouldn't be ranking in the global top three today!</span></p><div class="pagination">
