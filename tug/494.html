  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy sprawled before Marcus, struggling desperately to get back on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus released an invisible wave of force that pressed down on Jeremy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy felt hundreds of pounds were weighing him down, leaving him utterly immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honor your promise and kiss my boots," Marcus said coldly. "Otherwise, you can stay on the ground and forget about standing up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To someone like Jeremy, Marcus had to put him in his place. If he didn't teach him a lesson, Jeremy would never stop causing trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Marcus wasn't just acting for himself. He was here to help Shannon make Kyle and Penny give up on matchmaking. Having promised Shannon his help, Marcus was determined to make an impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's face turned ashen. Still sprawling on the ground, he felt as if his dignity had been stripped away. Hatred boiled within him as he snapped, "You country bumpkin! Let me up now, or you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know who I am? My parents are senior engineers at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, and I'll soon be working at Golden Group's pharmaceutical industrial park. My family's connections are way out of your league!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Golden Group? BioFusion Pharmaceuticals? Wow, that's impressive!" Marcus leaned back in his chair, crossing his legs, and gave Jeremy a mocking round of applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy, mistaking the sarcasm for awe, smirked even more smugly. "Now that you know how powerful we are, you'd better let me go. Maybe I'll spare you out of respect for Shannon. Otherwise, it won't take much for me to ruin your chances of surviving in Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy thought, "Marcus' wealth must come from shady dealings. If he truly had an impressive status, wouldn't he have flaunted it by now? Especially earlier, when Kyle and Penny pressed him for answers, he refused to say a word. That has to be suspicious. Besides, with my family's connections, a single phone call could bring Marcus to submit to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's confidence soared even higher after securing a lucrative position at Golden Group's pharmaceutical industrial park. He thought, "Golden Group is Solomia's leading conglomerate, a household name. Once I start working there, I'll not only enjoy a handsome salary but also rub shoulders with the company's elite, further expanding my already impressive network."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts, Jeremy dismissed Marcus as entirely beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, take my advice and let Jeremy go right now," Kyle said, trying to reason with Marcus. "Otherwise, you'll regret it. Jeremy's parents have a wide network of contacts in Kingston and Solomia. Don't say I didn't warn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "The more I hear from you, the more I think Golden Group's recruiters must have terrible judgment. How could they possibly hire someone like you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy sneered, "Who do you think you are to question Golden Group's interview process? I'm a PhD in medicine, educated overseas. Golden Group's pharmaceutical industrial park is brand new and needs top-tier talent like me. What could you possibly understand about that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, right, you barely have a middle school education. I can't expect you to comprehend things so far out of your league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny also looked at Marcus with disdain. They prided themselves on being intellectual elites, thoroughly dismissive of those uneducated country bumpkins. To people like that, no matter how much money they had, it was useless because their vision and mindset were not on par with their assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you seriously proud of getting into Golden Group's pharmaceutical industrial park?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy tilted his chin up smugly. "Of course I am! Golden Group is Solomia's top-tier conglomerate, and its pharmaceutical industrial park is one of the most advanced in the country. Landing a position there is something to be immensely proud of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Are you envious? Well, it won't do you any good. With your kind of education, the best you could hope for at Golden Group is a frontline worker or maybe a security guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jeremy's smug expression made Shannon fume. She was about to defend Marcus, but he raised a hand to stop her. Marcus said, "Let me make this official for you. Your interview is canceled, and Golden Group has rejected your application."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, Penny, and Jeremy froze, exchanging incredulous looks before they looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy sneered, "What nonsense are you talking about? Do you think you're some bigshot executive at Golden Group? You, a middle-school dropout, have the nerve to brag in front of me? Whether or not I join Golden Group is not for someone like you to decide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penny chimed in with equal disdain, "Shannon, you really need to reconsider your taste in boyfriends. This guy's delusional! He is spouting weird claims like he's living in some fantasy. Are you sure you want to stick with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon bit her lip, choosing to stay silent. Marcus' actions today had been baffling, and she decided that after this gathering, she'd sit him down and get some answers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
