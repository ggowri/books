  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falcon's muscles swelled with terrifying speed. Every fiber bulged, veins pulsing beneath his skin in a display of overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His punch cracked through the air like thunder, creating sonic booms as he launched himself at Marcus like a human missile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even blink. He met the attack head-on, their fists colliding with enough force to shake the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falcon stumbled backward, struggling to keep his footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking out his numb arm, he grimaced. "Damn," he muttered in disbelief. "You're a warrior too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Warriors were categorized into nine distinct ranks. Though both of them stood at the threshold of Stage One, Marcus held the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mastery of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire far exceeded Falcon's cultivation techniques, granting him an undeniable supremacy in raw strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk," Marcus snarled. "Time to end this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, he unleashed a devastating kick. Falcon barely managed to leap clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he dodged, Falcon let out a roar. A fiery red light glowed brightly, crimson flames erupted from his right arm, the intense heat turning the air around them into an inferno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames twisted and danced as Falcon launched a blazing punch, sending a massive fireball straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyebrow twitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He can do fire attacks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hmm,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> i</span><span style="font-style: italic;">nteresting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">H</span><span style="font-style: italic;">e's got some potential</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> as a w</span><span>arrior</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But still nowhere near my level</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> now</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no time to waste, he dove sideways, avoiding the fireball by inches, then immediately counterattacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing on the full power of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, his fist blazed with a terrifying aura of Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pure horror froze Falcon in place as the impending punch found him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flew through the air like a rag doll, hitting the ground with a sickening thud and coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward, planting his foot on Falcon's chest, pinning him down hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning in, he demanded, "Who sent you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that punch, Falcon lay there broken, his whole body screaming in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared up at Marcus in terror. "It was Anthony Wesley," he answered. "He ordered me to kill you. Please spare my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony, huh?" Marcus echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp gleam flickered in his eyes. Without another word, he brought his foot down hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falcon let out one last groan as his chest caved in. Then nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky had darkened completely, but a faint glimmer of light flickered from Falcon's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus bent down and began to search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers brushed against something hard in Falcon's pocket. Pulling it out, he found a red crystal the size of an egg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he touched it, heat shot through his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire Elemental Power Crystal," Marcus muttered, recognition dawning on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had described such crystals. This crystal held fire attribute power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder Falcon could have thrown those flame-powered punches earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's got such an impressive treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But his cultivation was far too shallow that he couldn't take full advantage of it yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If he'd managed to merge the crystal's power with his body, he'd have been way more dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Well, it's mine now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The fight is not that bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pocketed it. He'd planned to absorb its power later when he had time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would take his fighting skills to a whole new level. Plus, Fire Attribute Power would give him an edge if things ever went south.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had ascended to the ranks of warriors, he wasn't about to get cocky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Godfather's heir, he knew his two unknown brothers wanted him dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To survive and claim the position of Godfather, he needed to be the strongest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falcon and his crew had wasted him some time, but he still had to catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jumped in his Ferrari and raced toward his next destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, he reached the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door, he saw a figure hunched over, sweeping the yard in the moonlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad!" Marcus called out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
