  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recording revealed everything: Michelle gifting Adam money, step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond accepting Michelle's 10 million, Adam had repeatedly harassed her, making suggestive remarks and even hinting she could "repay" him in other ways&mdash;advances Michelle flatly rejected. The room erupted when the recording ended, the scandal spreading like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers and judgmental glances immediately fell on Madeline, who looked utterly livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others might not have recognized the voice in the recording, she knew it all too well&mdash;it was her husband's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had told her about the bribe but conveniently left out the part where he propositioned Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of bitterness surged within her, though Madeline was too poised to let it show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly shot back, "You think a recording is enough to frame my husband? Who's to say it's even real? What if it's been doctored?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her deflection gave the gathered parents pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a point&mdash;these days, with AI technology so advanced, even recordings, photos, and videos could be faked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, remained unfazed, his voice calm yet laced with sarcasm. "Why would I frame Adam? I don't even know the guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So where did you get the recording, then?" another parent demanded. "A friend of mine recorded it," Marcus replied with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, Madeline turned to Nora. "Teacher, this country bumpkin forged the recording to slander my husband! I suggest you call security and hand him over to the authorities for questioning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nora nodded, clearly intimidated by Adam's status as the head of the construction bureau, a man with considerable power. Even the school principal had to tread carefully around him. In her eyes, Marcus&mdash;a nobody from a rural background&mdash;had no chance of ever crossing paths with someone like Adam, let alone obtaining legitimate evidence against him. The recording had to be fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, security guards arrived and moved to apprehend Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus stayed seated, his gaze unwavering. "You're just security guards. Who gave you the authority to detain me? If you want to arrest someone, call the police. Otherwise, you're overstepping your bounds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled a chair closer and sat down, exuding an air of defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The parents watching the spectacle couldn't help but be impressed. Despite his rural roots, Marcus carried himself with sharp wit and unshakable confidence, making it impossible to dismiss him as an uneducated nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards hesitated. Since the school was under government jurisdiction, their protocol required them to act within legal limits. Marcus' challenge left them no choice but to stand down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Madeline fumbled for her phone and dialed the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see how long you can keep up that smug attitude! Just wait till the cops haul you off in cuffs for defaming my husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion drew an even larger crowd, with parents and teachers from neighboring classrooms craning their necks to see what was happening. The school principal, alerted to the disturbance, arrived with the dean of students in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The principal gave Marcus a cursory glance before turning his attention to Madeline, greeting her warmly. "Mrs. Parker, your child is an outstanding student. Rest assured, we'll provide all the resources necessary to support their education." He patted his chest as if making a solemn vow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline basked in the principal's assurances, her earlier anger giving way to smug satisfaction. The ongoing confrontation seemed insignificant now. She was certain Marcus was doomed the moment the police arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the sound of sirens blaring in the distance signaled the arrival of law enforcement. Several squad cars pulled up to the school's entrance, and uniformed officers made their way toward the classroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There! That's the one slandering my husband!" Madeline shouted, pointing at Marcus. "Take him away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead officer gestured for his team to move in. "Cuff him," he ordered, his eyes locking onto Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
