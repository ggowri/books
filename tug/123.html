Marcus asked, lighting a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lit a cigarette as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We await your guidance, Death," the Sync Group president replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man in his forties, he looked somewhat weathered but gave off an air of shrewd efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I acquired your four companies because I saw potential in you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to bring your companies to the number one spot in their respective industries in Uswad within a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever achieves this goal will be handsomely rewarded," Marcus said, glancing at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swept his gaze over them as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four exchanged glances before replying in unison, "We won't let you down. We'll do our best to complete the task!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded with satisfaction and added, "Starting today, your base salaries will be doubled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the four presidents immediately lit up with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were already earning millions annually, and doubling their salaries meant an additional million dollars or more each year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The incentive was incredibly enticing for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, their motivation skyrocketed upon hearing Marcus's decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" they said in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four presidents expressed their gratitude together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's expression turned serious. "As long as you perform well, not only will your salaries double, but your year-end bonuses will also be doubled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let me make one thing clear&mdash;since you chose this role, you must fulfill your duties and excel in your jobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about betrayal. If I find anyone leaking secrets, committing fraud, or taking company technology to another firm, the punishment will be severe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus balanced rewards with warnings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had only recently met the four and didn't know them well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Handing over such large companies required setting clear expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the four nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was their first meeting with Marcus, his commanding aura made it clear that he was a decisive and ruthless leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that crossing him would have dire consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, without my permission, you are not to reveal my identity to anyone. Do you understand?" Marcus continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus used the alias "Death" for these acquisitions to avoid drawing unnecessary attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" they replied in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four presidents collectively agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After discussing a few more matters with them, Marcus left the presidential suite at the Hilton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he got into a taxi, Marcus received a call from Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, what are you up to? I want to go shopping this afternoon to get some essentials and a necklace," Josie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since her relationship with Marcus began, Josie had noticeably become more cheerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also seemed to enjoy life and dressing up more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A necklace? Which one?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his memory, Josie wasn't particularly fond of wearing jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A limited edition from Chaumet. I've liked it for a long time, but I've been too busy with work to get it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The store assistant just posted that one came in today. I want to go check it out. Honey, can you come with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's voice was soft and sweet, making it hard to imagine she was a billionaire entrepreneur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaumet, a top luxury jewelry brand, reflected Josie's excellent taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure. Where are you now?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no reason to refuse. With no plans for the afternoon, a relaxing shopping trip with Josie sounded appealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm at the office. Where are you? I'll drive to pick you up," Josie replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. Just tell me which mall, and we'll meet there," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus was already in a taxi, he didn't want to trouble Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vertex Plaza."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, see you there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"See you there!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
