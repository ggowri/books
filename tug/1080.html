  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien was the only son of the Faust family's direct line. Not only did Garrick spoil him rotten, but Regis&mdash;who had no sons of his own&mdash;also treated him like his own child. Between the two of them, there was nothing they wouldn't do for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I got attacked at Solomia Institute of Technology. That bastard ruined me&mdash;he made sure I can never have kids! Our family line ends with me! Dad, you have to get over here right now.</span><br><span>"I want this guy crippled&mdash;I want him hacked to pieces and dumped in the ocean. Get here. Now!" Sebastien's voice was thick with rage, his breath hitching between gasps and sniffles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick fell silent for a moment before erupting in fury. "What did you just say? Someone crippled you down there? Who the hell did it? Tell me right now&mdash;I'll tear him to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien was the only male heir of the Faust family&mdash;their entire bloodline depended on him. Now that he was permanently ruined, it was nothing short of a disaster for the entire family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick had no intention of letting this slide. Without hesitation, he gathered dozens of security personnel from Faust Properties and stormed toward Solomia Institute of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His success in running a massive real estate empire wasn't just because of business acumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick had deep connections in both the legal and criminal worlds. He used to be a big name in the underground scene before "going legit" and shifting into real estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant he wasn't just any businessman&mdash;he was ruthless. And the men he hired as security weren't ordinary guards either. They were ex-thugs and mercenaries, people who weren't afraid to get their hands dirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A convoy of black SUVs roared through the city streets, heading straight for Solomia Institute of Technology. Within ten minutes, they arrived outside the women's dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick stepped out of the lead vehicle, flanked by his men. Despite being in his fifties, he carried himself with authority, radiating an aura that made people instinctively move aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers rippled through the crowd. "He's here. That's Mr. Faust, the CEO of Faust Properties. That man who threw the punch is done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I bet he never thought a single fight would get him into this kind of mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Faust probably will kill that man mercilessly. He isn't just rich&mdash;his brother, Mr. Regis Faust, is the police chief around here. Even if he kills someone, no one's going to touch him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of unease spread through the onlookers as their gazes shifted toward Marcus, filled with pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana, standing nearby, felt her heart hammering in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when she confronted Sebastien, she hadn't been afraid. He was just another spoiled rich kid&mdash;entitled, arrogant, and used to getting his way. Sure, he had stormed into the women's dorms demanding a girl to take to bed, but that was nothing she couldn't handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this? This was a whole different level. If Garrick was personally stepping in, things had spiraled out of control. This wasn't just some brat throwing a tantrum&mdash;this was a serious situation, one that could have devastating consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick was in a completely different league from Sebastien. He was the chairman of Faust Properties. He had wealth, power, and the kind of influence that made him untouchable. Marcus had no idea what he was up against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana's anxiety deepened as she turned to look at him&mdash;only to find him still lounging in his chair, looking completely unbothered, as if none of this had anything to do with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana rolled her eyes in frustration.</span><br><span>Is this guy an idiot? Does he not realize how much trouble he's in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father! You're finally here!" Sebastien pointed straight at Marcus, his voice dripping with venom. "That bastard humiliated me in front of everyone and ruined me for life! You can't let him walk away from this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I want him dead now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the state Sebastien was in&mdash;his pants stained with blood&mdash;Garrick's face twisted in rage. His vision swam for a moment, nearly making him black out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Sebastien's outstretched finger, his gaze landed on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know Marcus. His eyes darkened. "So, you're the one who crippled my son. Do you have any idea who you just messed with? He is my son! Do you have a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Garrick's words, Marcus finally stirred from his relaxed posture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat up, meeting Garrick's gaze with a calm, unwavering expression. "Your son barged into the women's dorms at Solomia Institute of Technology and tried to assault my sister," he said, voice steady. "I could've killed him. Consider yourself lucky I only made sure he'd never do it again."</span></p><div class="pagination">
