  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene frightened all the people present as they rushed to check on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike's body trembled uncontrollably, his face turned ashen with a faint purple hue spreading across his lips, and within moments, he fell into a deep coma!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mike, what's the matter with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Mike faint, Jordon immediately went forward to check, and his face clouded with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike was rushed to the hospital because there was no medical equipment at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike was thoroughly examined by the best doctor in Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The results showed abnormal insulin levels and severe pancreatitis symptoms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at this report, Jordon's eyes filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It suddenly occurred to him what Marcus said to his grandson in Robert's house during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That boy has actually been right? Impossible, this is absolutely impossible. There's no way he could diagnose an illness just by looking! This must be caused by environmental differences and his excessive drinking!" Jordon thought so and asked to use the equipment in person to examine his grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hospital readily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Jordon was a world-renowned professor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After more than an hour of secondary inspection, Jordon finally captured the tiny tumor growing on Mike's left pancreas through the ultrasound image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This tumor was only the size of a soybean and was covered with a layer of fat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was this fat layer that had obstructed previous scans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he were not experienced, it would be difficult to find anything unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of Mike's binge drinking, the tumor had mutated internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rupture of small blood vessels had led to the rapid spread of cancer cells, which had begun to spread all over the pancreas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If left untreated, Mike would likely not survive more than three days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, what happened to me? Why am I suddenly in a hospital? My stomach hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike woke up and asked Jordon feebly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mike, listen to me. Don't get excited. There's a hidden tumor on the left side of your pancreas. It has already spread, but don't worry. No matter the cost, I'll find a way to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon knew he couldn't hide it and confessed the truth to his grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The news hit Michael George like a thunderbolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike's body, which had just regained some strength, collapsed in the hospital bed again. He stared blankly at the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is it possible? I've always been healthy. How could I get cancer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, that Uswadian people... he was right! Who on earth is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon also looked gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, Marcus' words came true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, I am still young. I don't want to die. Since that man can predict my illness, he would have a cure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He even said that he could cure patients with terminal cancer. Grandpa, please ask him to come and save me. I don't want to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the thought that his life was coming to an end, Mike could no longer control his emotions and completely broke down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his only grandson in such agony, Jordon also looked distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a world-renowned top medical professor, he never thought that he would ask for help in his own field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for the sake of his grandson's life, he had to swallow his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he didn't have Marcus' contact information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to come to Robert's house again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Robert was cooking in person for her daughter, Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon's arrival made Robert look stunned. He asked unexpectedly, "What brings you back? Where's Mr. Mike Cole?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon's expression was heavy. The arrogance he once carried had vanished, replaced with a humbled and desperate demeanor, "I'm here to ask for your help, Professor Cooper!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade also heard the noise at the door and came out of the room curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please, just say what you need. If I can help, I won't refuse," Robert said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My grandson Mike's pancreatic cancer has spread. If he is not treated, he will not live for more than three days. I'm here to beg you to ask Mr. Fitzgerald to treat my grandson!" Jordon said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment these words left his mouth, both Robert and Jade froze, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pancreatic cancer? Wasn't that what Marcus predicted before? They hadn't expected it to come true!</span></p><div class="pagination">
