  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene made people more curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Maxine, the best student in Solomia Special Police Academy, had no such treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person didn't even wear a police uniform. How could he be so solemnly introduced by Brenden?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young police officer of Kingston Special Police Brigade took the initiative to stand up and ask Brenden, "May I ask which police department is this colleague from, and does he deserve to be introduced by Mr. Wilde?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately attracted many people's echo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also wanted to know the true identity of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is not a member of the police department. Because Mr. Murphy was injured, he was unable to participate in this operation, so I took the initiative to invite Mr. Fitzgerald to replace him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This arrest brought together the best elites of the Uswad Police Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The organization attached great importance to it, and all police departments wanted to make contributions and take the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the participation of Marcus, Solomia Special Police Academy instantly became one of the favorable contenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was what Brenden wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This person does not belong to our department? Is here just to make up the numbers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, as a layman, why is he here? More importantly, can he resist the hit of those gangsters in the Black Hawk Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If any ordinary person can take part in the arrest, then what is the meaning of us being trained for many years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden's words immediately aroused the dissatisfaction of many team members present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To take part in this action, they conducted a rigorous trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being selected at different levels, they entered the final list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many elites had been screened during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Solomia Special Police Academy found an ordinary person casually and let him join the operation without any training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their view, such behavior was extremely irresponsible and unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it easy, everyone. Mr. Fitzgerald is not what you think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although he is not a member of our department, he is not an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must have heard about the hijacking of the Black Hawk Legion last time. Mr. Fitzgerald is one of the important heroes who arrested the hijackers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden explained to all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people still looked disdain. A member of the Concord Special Police Brigade sneered and said, "I remember that the main contributor to the hijacking incident was Maxine. Even if this person had contributed, he must have only played a supporting role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to convince us, let him show his strength, otherwise, all of us will not agree with him to take part in this action!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately attracted the approval of many people present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, let me test this person's strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a member of the Solariae Police Brigade, Kobe, stepped forward and came to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Marcus in disdain and said, "Since you are the main hero of the hijacking incident, you should be good at fighting. Try taking a punch from me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished his words, Kobe directly punched Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch was so overbearing that it went straight to Marcus' face. Kobe had no intention of being merciful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gasped and didn't expect Kobe to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, many people were watching the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took the chance to see Marcus' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Kobe's fist arrived, Marcus' hand was stretched out and caught that man's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kobe was stunned. He never dreamed that Marcus' speed was so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the punch of Kobe was so strong. He didn't intend to be merciful, but he couldn't move forward after being caught by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also punched Kobe like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kobe was stunned but couldn't hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Marcus' fist stopped a centimeter away from Kobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kobe was surprised out in a cold sweat and looked grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Marcus deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus seemed to be powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't speak but casually shook off Kobe's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kobe was suddenly dumped and almost fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although we come from all corners of the country, since we are gathered, we are a collective, and we should be unite. I don't want anyone to have such disharmonious behavior again. Otherwise, I will report it to his original unit and let the original unit punish him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden said in a cold voice, and his words could not be doubted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others didn't look very good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought that Marcus would be suppressed when the member from Concord made a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never thought that Marcus was not only good but also showed his power!</span></p><div class="pagination">
