  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked with a smirk, "How do you wanna play?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon chuckled, replying, "For men like us, ordinary guns are nothing but scrap metal. Do you really think that machine gun in your hand can hurt me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scoffed, "I've heard all about you, Brandon. Once the top fighter in Solomia. Seems like you still think you're as invincible as ever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon waved a hand dismissively. "Let's not waste time with idle chitchat. I've sized you up. Out of everyone here, only I can give you a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to save your parents? You'll have to get past me first. If I bite the dust, you get 25% of the shares. If not, Golden Group falls entirely under my control!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, appreciating the straightforwardness. "I like you. No beating around the bush. Let's finish this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the last word even left his mouth, Brandon moved. It was as if a gust of wind had swept across the floor. Brandon was standing several feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, his palm was flying toward Marcus's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus threw a punch to meet the incoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision of their fists sent shockwaves through the air. Marcus staggered back, feeling his arm go numb from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon announced arrogantly, "You took that hit and only stumbled? Not bad. But don't forget, I was holding back. I only used 70% of my strength. Push me further, and you'll see what real power feels like. You'll die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was at Ancient Martial Stage Two. In his mind, brats like Marcus were nothing more than speed bumps on his road to total control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then try me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tightened his stance, channeling the full power of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon's eyes flashed with a dangerous light. His aura exploded, filling the air with a suffocating pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists moved like thunder, crashing down toward Marcus with earth-shattering force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus ducked under the first punch, his leg lashing out in a vicious kick aimed at Brandon's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon was stunned. He hadn't expected Marcus to be so fast. In a flash, his hand shot out, forming a claw that dug toward Marcus's shoulder, completely ignoring the incoming kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resounding bang, Marcus's kick, powered by the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, landed but utterly failed to harm Brandon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus' shock, Brandon's claw grabbed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon smirked, his voice dripping with sarcasm as he taunted, "Hey, kiddo, you're just a newbie at this ancient martial arts, and you think you can lay a finger on me? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sneered those words, he yanked Marcus off balance with sudden force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could recover, Brandon's fist slammed into his abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grunted, doubling over as blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in their strength was immense, though they were only separated by one level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer impact of being a warrior at a higher level was far greater than Marcus had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon pressed his advantage, launching a flurry of attacks like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus defended with everything he had as he desperately used the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to block the relentless barrage. For a moment, Marcus managed to hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon's expression soured. Gritting his teeth, he growled, "You think you can keep this up? Might as well give up now, and I might just leave you in one piece!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the words left his mouth, he unleashed an onslaught that was fiercer than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus threw out his fist in defiance, his body trembling violently under the strain. Yet, with his teeth clenched tight, he stood his ground, enduring the ferocious assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the same breath, with a swift motion, he scooped the dagger from the ground with his left hand and drove it with all his might into Brandon's left shoulder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Brandon's mastery over Ancient Martial Stage Two, he was not made of stone; he could bleed, and he could feel pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade pierced through flesh, and blood burst forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon gaped at Marcus in shock, a snarl of pain escaping his lips. He hadn't expected Marcus to be so reckless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a vicious backhand, Brandon slammed his palm into Marcus's chest. Blood spurted from Marcus's mouth. His insides felt like they'd been turned to mush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon declared, "Still hanging in there, huh? Guess I'll have to pull out a few tricks of my own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though confident in his ability to take down Marcus in close combat, Brandon was wary of a pyrrhic victory; he didn't fancy the idea of both of them limping away from this fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Brandon stepped back, a sharp exhale escaping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, his body appeared to encase itself in what looked like a thick, rugged layer of bark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vines grew rapidly, like living tentacles, lashing out and wrapping around Marcus before he could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each vine was tipped with sharp, blade-like edges, glinting in the dim light of the factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus shot up his eyebrows in sheer surprise; he never imagined that Brandon was a cultivator of the Wood Attribute Power, nor that he could command it with such finesse!</span></p><div class="pagination">
