  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo grabbed onto Julian's leg like his life depended on it, his voice cracking as he pleaded, "Dad, you can't do this to me! I'm your son, for God's sake! How could you strip me of my position?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian shoved him away with a firm kick, his voice cutting like steel. "I've spent my entire life serving my country&mdash;fighting wars in my youth, leading in peace during my old age. And to think I fathered a son like you. You're a disgrace to the Ashford name. Don't bother begging me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without sparing him another glance, Julian steadied himself and walked toward Marcus. He gave a faint smile, though his eyes held a glint of apology. "My son has made a grave mistake by offending you, Marcus, and violating organizational discipline. I've taken appropriate action. May I hope this resolves your grievances?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a small nod, his expression calm but respectful. "Commander Ashford, your sense of justice is truly admirable. I'm impressed. If there's ever anything I can do for you in the future, don't hesitate to ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't expected this outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Julian might simply release Benjamin and give Pablo a stern rebuke. That would've already been more than enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to everyone's astonishment, Julian had publicly dismissed Pablo from his position as director of the OIG.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level of principle and integrity demonstrated by the older generation was something worth applauding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their moral compass was leagues above the average person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian chuckled warmly. "Marcus, if you'd consider joining the military, that would be the greatest favor you could do for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had always had an eye for talent, having mentored numerous military leaders who later achieved great heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Marcus was a diamond in the rough&mdash;the last prodigy he wanted to shape before his retirement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the one contribution he believed could still make a difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus opened his mouth to politely decline, Julian spoke again, his tone almost conspiratorial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's what I propose, Marcus. I'll appoint you as a Special Military Advisor with the rank of Major. You'll retain full autonomy to pursue your work outside the military. All I ask is that, should the military require your expertise, you step in to assist. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian understood the importance of timing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just made a bold move, and he was counting on Marcus finding it hard to turn him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As predicted, Marcus hesitated briefly, looking as though he were weighing the options, before nodding. "Since you've extended such a generous offer, Commander Ashford, it would be rude of me to refuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's laughter echoed through the room, full of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Marcus was beyond </span><span>just being a marksman</span><span> at the Sixth Avenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something more, something formidable beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as an unbound Special Advisor, Marcus could become a trump card, the kind of ally who could turn the tide in a crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Julian to not only disown his son publicly but also immediately extend such an invitation to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear from Julian's every word and action that he held Marcus in high regard&mdash;perhaps even a bit of fatherly pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo, though fuming on the inside, didn't dare say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Arabella stood frozen, the color draining from her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't anticipated that one phone call from Marcus could lead to Pablo's dismissal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse, she'd been actively stirring the pot. If Marcus chose to retaliate, even her own connections wouldn't stand a chance against Julian Ashford's authority.</span></p><div class="pagination">
