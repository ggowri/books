  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Travis didn't consciously release any aura upon his arrival, most of the people around him could still sense the immense power emanating from him, a clear sign of his mastery at Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Liam and Ada were visibly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam spoke up first, his voice respectful, "Mr. Sullivan, it's good to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a slight bow, his expression betraying a quiet sense of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world of Ancient Martial Art, the experts commanded respect, and Travis, being the first to reach Ancient Martial Stage Nine, was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis, however, seemed more interested in Ada. His gaze landed on her with a grin. "Ms. Wakefield, I didn't expect to see you here. What a coincidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned back to Liam, his tone shifting to something more inquisitive. "From the reports I've gotten, the space-time gate at </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall was supposed to open yesterday. If it was scheduled to stay open for three days, that means there's still a day left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised an eyebrow, curious. "So, shouldn't you all be inside the gate, exploring its secrets? Why are you still up here on the surface waiting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam gave a small laugh. "Mr. Sullivan, you might not be aware, but the dangers within the space-time gate are far greater than we anticipated. None of us have entered to explore yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured to Marcus and Ada. "Only Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Wakefield have just returned from their journey inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of Liam's voice, Travis' gaze shifted toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that he noticed the young man standing next to Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis immediately released his spiritual powers, probing Marcus' cultivation level, trying to discern his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a moment, he couldn't get a clear read. The power radiating from Marcus remained elusive, impossible to penetrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing Travis could confirm was that Marcus was in his early twenties&mdash;far too young to have lived through multiple lifetimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization sparked a sense of condescension in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world of Ancient Martial Art in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, anyone who hadn't lived through samsara was typically considered to lack the experience necessary for serious achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Travis' view, strength was largely a matter of time&mdash;most people built their power through years of grinding, accumulating it slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Few, if any, could reach the highest levels quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, young one," Travis spoke, his voice laced with a faint air of superiority. "What did you find inside the space-time gate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes looked down at Marcus, his tone dripping with an unmistakable sense of disdain, and there was a commanding note to his words, as if expecting an answer without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, his expression unfazed. "I don't know you, so why should I answer your question? If you're so curious about the space-time gate, you can go in and find out for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Marcus refused to answer&mdash;it was that Travis had shown him no respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To come at him with such a condescending attitude, demanding answers like an arrogant superior, was enough to make anyone want to turn away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And besides, the dangers of the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall's space-time gate were well-known. Every person who had ventured inside did so knowing it was a gamble with their life, </span><span>a dangerous opportunity that could be lost in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would anyone casually share their experiences from such a perilous journey with someone like Travis?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Marcus could finish speaking, Travis' expression darkened, his brow furrowing in irritation. He spoke coldly, "With my status, it's a privilege for you to be asked questions by me. You really don't know how lucky you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured toward the group around them, his voice laced with arrogance. "Everyone here would consider it an honor to be in my circle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a sharp, mocking laugh. "Sorry, I'm not interested in joining your circle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he turned to Ada. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada nodded quietly, and as Marcus reached for her hand, they prepared to leave the scene.</span></p><div class="pagination">
