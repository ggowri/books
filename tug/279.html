  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bayside Amusement Park claimed the title of Airsia's largest amusement park, with an unprecedented scale of construction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, the bidding war had drawn major construction firms from all the major cities of Uswad, making the competition incredibly fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Melina was from Kingston, the Flourish Group was a local real estate business there, with operations yet to expand nationwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its reputation wasn't widely recognized, at least not among the construction firms present here. It didn't hold any advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For this bidding event, the higher-ups in Melina's family had high hopes for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they could win the bid, the Flourish Group would successfully enter the domestic market, further expanding their business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I apologize. I represent Kingston's Flourish Group," Melina said with an apologetic look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many appeared bewildered, seemingly unfamiliar with the Flourish Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One person spoke up, "Whether you're from Kingston or Solariae, the bidding has already begun. You're not punctual, let alone lacking the basic spirit of contract. I suggest we disqualify them from the event!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speaker was Ethan, from Rivera Construction Group, a large listed company that integrated real estate construction, engineering construction, real estate sales, and real estate business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chairman of Rivera Construction Group, Mark Rivera, ranked in the top ten of Solariae's rich list, a true billionaire heavyweight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this bidding event, they were determined to secure the amusement park project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting beside Ethan was an exquisitely beautiful girl. She sat casually yet exuded an elegance that was hard to match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She appeared to be in her twenties but radiated an imposing vibe that was beyond the reach of ordinary people, indicating her extraordinary status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was Emma Rivera, Mark's second daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Rivera Construction Group was led by Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Ethan made his remarks, Emma remained composed, not even sparing a glance at Marcus and Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps, in her eyes, a real estate company from Kingston had no right to compete with Rivera Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rivera Construction Group was the most formidable bidder present. Therefore, Ethan's words immediately garnered support from many in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People began to call for the disqualification of Melina's bidding rights, a classic case of "piling on when someone was down".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina frowned at the host, "I'm new here and not familiar with the roads in Solomia, and we encountered traffic, so we were five minutes late. We've rushed here as fast as we could. Please give us a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, Melina bowed to the host on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female looked somewhat embarrassed and hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But under pressure, he could only say to Melina, "I'm sorry, ma'am, but the bidding has rules. Everything must be done according to the rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The troublemakers wore smug smiles on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They clearly don't know the ropes. Now they've been disqualified. Let's see how they explain themselves back home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, if it weren't for Rivera Construction Group to uphold justice, these miscellaneous people would have slipped in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many whispered, casting sarcastic glances at Marcus and Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina pouted, "Marcus, this is all your fault. If you hadn't insisted on... in the car, we wouldn't have been late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she was blaming Marcus, he couldn't get angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus awkwardly laughed it off. She was right. It was his fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Melina, don't worry. Let me make a call. I think I can sort this out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' words reached everyone present, and Ethan scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where did this guy come from? The host already said their qualifications were canceled, and he thinks he can fix it with a phone call. Does he really think he's someone important?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many agreed with Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't care about their ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just stepped aside and dialed Michelle's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He learned through the call that Golden Group was a highly reputed enterprise in Solomia, one that had been actively invited to the bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But recently, with the expansion of Golden Group's business, Michelle was overwhelmed and had to decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To save face for the bidding, Michelle had sent a few people to support the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those few were now seated in their designated spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus hang up the phone, Ethan inquired with a teasing tone, "Sir, have you finished your call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I have. Is there something you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ethan's tone and expression made Marcus feel somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when Ethan protested to the host, Marcus only thought it was his and Melina's fault. After all, they were indeed late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ethan not only kept stirring up the crowd's emotions but also spoke to him with a mocking attitude, which was tantamount to provocation!</span></p><div class="pagination">
