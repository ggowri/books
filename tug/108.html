  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana called out as Marcus prepared to leave early the following day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Brown family in Kingston actively hunting for opportunities to take Marcus's life, stepping outside had become a dangerous gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading to Kingston," Marcus replied flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Going to Kingston right now? Have you lost your mind, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Brown family will always be a threat. Instead of waiting around to die, I'm taking the fight to them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm walking straight into their den. Let them try to kill me! I want to see what they've really got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's voice was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes fixed on Marcus, struggling to understand his reasoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew better than anyone that once Marcus set his mind to something, no amount of persuasion would change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While his actions seemed reckless to her, she couldn't help but admire his boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the third son of the Godfather, Marcus had an extraordinary background at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he'd never once considered using Godfather's influence to smooth over his troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he constantly strives to improve and strengthen himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, last night, Diana only revealed her magic skills to reassure Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Ricardo indeed attacked Marcus, Diana could handle it for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus still chose to face Kingston alone; such courage and boldness are the marks of a true man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Diana admire him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting off the plane, Marcus found himself drawn to Sunshine Estates as if by some invisible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Kingston, Josie was the only person he knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just one woman who couldn't offer him any real help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Josie was the first person who came to his mind, stirring something in him he couldn't quite explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood across the street from the complex just as Josie walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked elegant and professional in a navy blue trench coat, fitted jeans, and heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without noticing Marcus, she got into her Mercedes and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hailed a taxi and followed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, her Mercedes pulled up in front of a kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally realized that Josie was here to pick up her daughter, Leia Anderson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd had gathered at the kindergarten entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could hear a woman's shrill voice cutting through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little bastard! Look what you did to my daughter! Apologize right now or I'll beat the hell out of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you're such a poorly raised brat without a father! Didn't your mom tell you how your dad died? Teacher... just expel this bastard child already! She's bringing down the whole school's reputation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The insults were as harsh as could be, and the woman's voice grew louder and louder, attracting the attention of many parents who had come to pick up their children from the kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between the curses, the cries of a little girl could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recognized those cries and instinctively pushed through the crowd. There he saw a heavyset woman who looked like a typical slumlord screaming at a little girl no more than five or six years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl was crying inconsolably, her tiny frame shaking with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy-set woman wouldn't let up, even grabbing the girl's hair. "You little bastard! I told you to apologize to my daughter! Are you deaf? If you don't apologize right now, I swear I'll beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the woman raised her hand to strike the child, Josie caught her wrist mid-swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell do you think you're doing?" she snapped. "You're really going to beat up a little kid in public?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
