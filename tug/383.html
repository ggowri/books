  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This bloody scene made everyone feel fear, and some women even gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought those people from the underground world were indeed ruthless, severing their subordinates' ligaments of hands and legs in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought no wonder these subordinates were so afraid of the gang's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And it was all because of this young man in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was hard to imagine how respected his status was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After doing all this, Tony again smiled flatteringly at Marcus and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, it was my poor management. When I get back to Solariae, I'll definitely clean up the Black Tiger Gang and won't let this riff-raff hold important positions anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand to Tony and said, "If you have other things to do, go ahead. I'll handle things here myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony's eyes flickered as he glanced at Randy not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately understood Marcus' meaning. Marcus' influence was mainly in Solariae, and Randy was the mayor's son in Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was doing this to protect their Black Tiger Gang, which made Tony feel some gratitude towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After bowing deeply once more, he dragged Nicholas, whose ligaments in his hands and feet had been severed, away from the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy and his group trembled with fear. Despite their prestigious statuses as billion-dollar heirs, witnessing the severing of tendons was something they had only seen in movies and TV shows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing it with their own eyes was far more shocking than any on-screen depiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me, you blocked me and smashed my car. How are you going to settle this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked Randy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy's face darkened. Without Nicholas and the others to back him up, he felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looked like he had no choice but to call his cousin for help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Randy snarled at Marcus. "Don't get cocky. So what if I smashed your car? Just wait. I'll call my cousin right now, and he'll come take care of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll show you what Battle God Oliver is like. Just don't come crawling to me on your knees!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly, "Oh, go ahead and call him. I'm really curious to see what Battle God Oliver is all about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Marcus sat down on a public bench by the roadside, lit a cigarette, and crossed his legs, waiting patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Battle God Oliver? This guy is actually his cousin. Looks like he's part of the Deleon family too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn, what a legend. The Deleon family is known as the top family in Uswad. I never expected this young man to be part of the Deleon family. This is going to be interesting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, I thought it was impressive that he brought in members of the Black Tiger Gang, but I didn't realize he was involved in Battle God Oliver!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even though this guy is someone Tony respects, compared to Battle God Oliver, he's nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Comparing him to Battle God Oliver is just an insult to the Battle God himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, various opinions filled the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more people stopped to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Word spread that Battle God Oliver was about to arrive, and some people even called their friends to come see the spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After some back-and-forth, Randy quickly hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you have the guts, don't run. My cousin is on his way. You're just hanging out with a few gangsters at best. When my cousin arrives, I'll make sure he beats you so badly your own mother won't recognize you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy glared at Marcus, his eyes full of hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he had suspected earlier, Randy and Oliver were both members of the Deleon family, yet there was such a huge difference between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was a rebellious and arrogant heir, while the other was a revered Battle God. The contrast was stark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Randy, I bet this guy is really nervous, but he's still pretending to be calm. Once your cousin arrives, he'll probably be scared out of his mind..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within ten minutes, sirens sounded from the other end of the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several SWAT vehicles sped towards them and quickly parked in front of Marcus and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're here. Battle God Oliver has really arrived. It looks like this young man is truly a member of the Deleon family. I want to see how he handles this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What else can he do? Kneel and beg for mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people discussed this loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doors of the police cars opened, and Battle God Oliver, along with a dozen other SWAT officers, jumped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus recognized them from previous operations, especially those involved in the capture of Abel and Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they were all here with Battle God Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver had one arm wrapped in bandages, but his presence was still powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he arrived, countless people around them gasped in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Uswad's Battle God. As expected, he's truly impressive!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
