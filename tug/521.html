  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's cheeks burned with embarrassment as regret flashed through her mind&mdash;why had she screamed so loudly earlier?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sarah already knows what we were doing. Whether she heard it or not doesn't matter anymore," Marcus said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina lowered her head, too shy to respond. Her bashful demeanor reignited the fire in Marcus. A certain part of him throbbed with desire. Without hesitation, he pressed Melina beneath him again, entering her in one swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barely recovered from the overwhelming waves of passion, Melina was once more filled to the brim. The sensation seemed even more intense this time like her whole being was on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their heated battle resumed, more fervent and untamed than before. This time, it lasted two hours before finally coming to an end. Marcus brought Melina to the peak six times, utterly leaving her spent, unconscious in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at the young woman beneath him, Marcus felt a wave of satisfaction as his eyes took in her glistening skin and flushed, soft body. He sat at the edge of the bed, closing his eyes to begin cultivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a recent period of diligent practice, Marcus' mastery over his cultivation manuals had seen significant improvements. Among them, his progress in Lightning and Firebolt was particularly remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the result of the two elemental energy crystals he had fused earlier, allowing his comprehension of these magics to skyrocket. Through this continuous surge, Marcus had directly elevated his magic level to the fifth tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, aside from his mastery of Ancient Martial Arts, Marcus was now officially a Fifth-Tier Wizard. Such a level placed him among the experts in the world of Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the wilderness outside Kingston, a figure in a sleek black suit sat cross-legged, an overwhelming aura surrounding him. The oppressive energy warped the air, making it hard to breathe. This man was none other than Phoenix of the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two elders from the Order had been killed by Marcus, Phoenix had personally set out to track down him. By now, Phoenix had gathered enough information about Marcus and was simply awaiting the right moment to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a faint disturbance rippled through the void. A figure emerged from the shadows, cloaked in a black robe, and his face was obscured by a hood. Only a pair of blood-red eyes glimmered from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix, still in his meditative state, did not open his eyes. His voice, steady and commanding, broke the silence. "Who are you, and why are you here?" For someone to approach unnoticed meant they were no ordinary foe. Phoenix remained vigilant but refrained from acting recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The robed figure's voice was cold and distant, as though echoing from the depths of the abyss. "The one who killed members of the Astral Serpent Order is in Kingston. Why aren't you moving yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix's eyes snapped open, and cold light flashed in his pupils. "This is an internal matter of the Astral Serpent Order. Whether I deal with the killer or not is none of your concern." As the master of a sect and a pinnacle expert of the Ancient Martial Stage Six, Phoenix would not allow himself to be dictated by anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what if I insist you act?" The figure's chilling tone carried an aura of absolute authority, making it impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix's expression darkened, and his battle-hardened instincts ignited. "Then let's see if you have the power to force me." With his unparalleled strength, there were few in the entire Uswad Ancient Martial Arts world who could match him. He was eager to see just how much skill this arrogant braggart truly possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could act, however, the robed figure raised a hand. A crimson glow burst forth, piercing through the air and entering Phoenix's body with lightning speed. Phoenix's body trembled violently, his face twisting in agony. He quickly mobilized his Numinous Energy, trying to expel the foreign power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the crimson energy was like a relentless demon, wrapping around him, binding him from within. His body convulsed, and his face was contorted in pain, and within moments, he ceased struggling. His eyes dulled, and a crimson light flickered in his pupils before vanishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you are but a dog under the command of Mr. Roger Gellar. Do you understand?" the robed figure said with a sinister grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix, now an empty shell of his former self, nodded mechanically. "I am Mr. Roger Gellar's loyal servant. Awaiting orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Head to Kingston immediately and kill Marcus," the figure commanded coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix nodded once more before walking down the mountain, and his steps were stiff and mechanical. The robed figure stood still, and a wicked smile crept onto his obscured face. As crimson light enveloped him, his body gradually faded into the shadows, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus remained deep in meditation, his energy resonating with the surrounding elements. Suddenly, a powerful wave of spiritual energy surged toward him, locking onto his location with an unmistakable intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' instincts flared. The danger was approaching fast. Without hesitation, he executed a teleportation spell, disappearing from the Thurman Villa and reappearing atop a remote mountain outside Kingston. But the pursuing energy signature shifted once more, locking onto him again with frightening precision. It wouldn't be long before the presence arrived.</span></p><div class="pagination">
