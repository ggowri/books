  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia was thoroughly exhausted by Marcus' passionate lovemaking, but this time, she was noticeably more uninhibited than the first time. She was also more aware of how to savor the pleasure they shared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, breathing heavily, pulled Cecilia into his arms. Her skin was flushed, her body glistening with a delicate sheen of perspiration, and she rested her head against his broad, muscular chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," she murmured, "are you returning to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gently nodded. "Yes, there's nothing else for me to attend to with the McHale family, so it's time for me to go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will you come visit me in </span><span>Acoton</span><span> again?" Cecilia asked, her eyes filled with anticipation. She was terrified that Marcus would forget about her once he returned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "Of course, don't worry. I'll come see you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia pouted, a hint of resentment in her expression. "I'll hold you to that. You mustn't lie to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stroked her silky hair. "Don't worry, how could I ever deceive you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell you what," he said, "whenever you miss me, just send me a message, and I promise I'll appear before you within five minutes. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll remember that," Cecilia replied with a sweet smile, not taking his words seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Acoton</span><span> and </span><span>Uswad</span><span> are thousands of miles apart, and even by private jet, the fastest flight takes six or seven hours. So, how could Marcus possibly appear before her in five minutes? Though Cecilia suspected he was </span><span>joking,</span><span> she was still thrilled by his promise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They spent the night together, indulging their desires. Only after sending Cecilia to </span><span>the peak of ecstasy once more did Marcus finally end their lovemaking and slip into a meditative state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though his cultivation had reached the Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Four through his dual cultivation with Alison, his foundation wasn't yet solid. Under the influence of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, Marcus not only stabilized his state but also consumed several pills, pushing his cultivation towards the perfected stage of Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, Marcus got up and headed to the airport, choosing not to teleport. He believed it was best to avoid using such secret techniques casually, lest he attract unwanted attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia offered to send him off in her family's private jet, but Marcus declined. Not wanting to trouble her, he opted to take a commercial flight back home.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The international flight from </span><span>Acoton</span><span> to </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, was eleven hours long. Marcus settled into a business class seat and enjoyed a good sleep. And before he knew it, the plane had landed at </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Airport.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he left the airport, he spotted Diana's youthful and radiant figure in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Diana asked, her bright blue eyes blinking curiously, "what were you doing in </span><span>Acoton</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just taking care of some personal business, nothing important," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, right, you just don't want to tell me," Diana pouted, "but I can guess. You were off chasing after another pretty girl, weren't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They got into a waiting car, and it sped off towards Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What pretty girls am I chasing?" Marcus retorted, trying to deflect the conversation. He'd never sensed Diana being jealous of his interactions with other women. But lately, something had changed, and her words carried a distinct tang of bitterness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was wearing a fitted professional dress that accentuated her already stunning figure. Her long, slender, and smooth legs were encased in black stockings, sparking the imagination. From Marcus' vantage point, he could even see what lay beneath the hem of her skirt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't resist placing a hand on her leg, gently caressing it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
