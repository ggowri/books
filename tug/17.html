  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth through the pain, Anthony refused once more. "I'm not signing!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drove the broken bottle deeper into his hand. Glass ripped through flesh with a sickening crunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing pain shot through Anthony, threatening to steal his consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last chance," Marcus growled. "Sign it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony met Marcus's gaze and saw something terrifying - the cold, dead eyes of someone who'd danced with death and come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pure fear clawed at his gut as his survival instincts kicked in. All fight drained from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I-I'll sign! Please, I'll sign anything!" he choked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he pressed his fingerprint onto the document.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hard-earned shares and power for decades were now all Marcus'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anthony is Mr. Roger Gellar's man. Do you really think you can treat him like this and get away with it?" Laird's voice turned icy. "Mr. Gellar's going to destroy you for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing Anthony's miserable condition, Laird felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood up slowly. With a flick of his left hand, he revealed a pistol and pulled the trigger in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet hit Anthony's temple. Blood erupted from the wound like a geyser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in shock and glazed over as his body slumped to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze locked onto Laird. "You're under Roger Gellar's wing as well," he asserted with a steely conviction. "And that means you can join Anthony now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he even finished his sentence, Marcus fired again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he had foreseen this moment, Laird dodged just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate. He kept shooting and the endless bullets tore through the air toward his target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Laird moved like a ghost, evading every shot with supernatural agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bullets can't kill me, fool!" Laird sneered. "Let's see who survives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Laird started to murmur an arcane incantation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, the air twisted around him, his aura turning dark and evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He removed his glasses. His once blue eyes now glowed a menacing blood red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice turned into a savage growl as he lunged at Marcus with inhuman speed, sharp fangs bared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Jeez, he's a vampire from Weston Land!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Those vampires are known for their evil power, feeding on human blood to amplify their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And this monster, with all his terrifying strength, is just Roger's errand boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looks like my biological brother is even more of a badass than I imagined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Laird lunged at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His claws sliced through the air with lethal intent, aiming directly at Marcus' chest in an attempt to dominate and seize control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus threw a powerful punch at Laird with a thud. But Laird's body merely quivered, like a ripple on the water, showing no sign of harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, one of his razor-sharp claws raked across Marcus' chest, leaving behind a bloody gash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar wanted Anthony to handle you," Laird sneered. "But since you're here, I'll kill you myself. Don't bother struggling. Even as a warrior, you're nothing more than food to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks came fast and furious. His defense was impenetrable, his strength overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus found himself backing up, struggling against the vampire's raw power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this vampire wasn't fully mature. Marcus still had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the surprise - Laird wasn't just using vampire powers. He was casting spells like a seasoned wizard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Purple lightning bolts crashed down around Marcus in a deadly storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't expect wizard powers, did you? Your death is well-deserved!" Laird's voice dripped with arrogance. "I want to see how you can kill me now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always sensed something peculiar about the lightning Laird unleashed; it didn't strike him as conjured by magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, Marcus pushed his body to its limits. He dodged between lightning bolts, closing the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he got close enough, he switched on his X-ray vision.</span></p><div class="pagination">
