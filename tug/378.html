  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only then that Marcus realized there was a unique scent to Grace's essence, one that reminded him of lilies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was fresh, calming, and uplifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As more of the fluid continued to flow, the entire room seemed filled with the delicate fragrance of lilies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... I think I'm going to die... I can't move anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's body went limp, completely surrendering to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the continuous flow of Marcus' Timeless Numinous Energy, Grace's second clogged energy channel gradually started to open up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her complexion seemed to become rosier, and her skin visibly improved, regaining some of its previous radiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, clearing the energy channels really does help with skin's texture and glow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus finally confirmed this for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Grace trembling on the bed, he removed his coat and gently covered her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't notice, though, that as he did so, a faint smile appeared on Grace's flushed face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, Grace slowly regained her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression softened as she looked up at Marcus. Her voice was tender as she said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm cold... could you hold me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus paused, caught off guard by her request, but then nodded and pulled her gently into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace rested her head against his broad chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt a strange sense of comfort and security, as though everything was right in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you've seen everything about me... even my most embarrassing moments... I don't think I'll ever be able to marry anyone now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace looked up, still flushed with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Marcus could respond, she continued, "I've decided... I'll never marry. My body can only belong to you, Mr. Fitzgerald. I won't change my mind, not in this lifetime..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was struck by a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt what a sweet, innocent girl she was, so pure and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't say that, silly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus pulled her closer, gently stroking her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At one point, Grace unexpectedly kissed him on the lips, blushing fiercely before quickly running into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of water soon filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she came out, her hair was damp, and she wore a simple pink dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked like a lotus flower just plucked from the water, pure and full of youthful charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said to her softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace nodded with a small smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They both got into Marcus' Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they arrived at the neighborhood where Benjamin lived, someone called out from behind them just as they were about to enter the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace! Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voice belonged to a young man dressed in trendy clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was accompanied by a few of his friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all looking equally fashionable and wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace furrowed her brow, turning reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man gave her a cold, mocking look, scanning her up and down before glancing at Marcus. He sneered, "I've been texting you on WhatsApp, and you haven't replied, huh? So you've moved on to another guy? You're really a whore, Grace. Acting all innocent and pure in front of me, but as soon as you're better, you're hooking up with someone else? I never thought you'd be such a hypocrite, a shameless flirt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's brow furrowed further, her face flushing with anger. "Randy, how many times do I have to tell you? I'm not interested in dating! We're just not right for each other. Can you please stop pestering me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And please don't slander Mr. Fitzgerald! He's my friend, not some random man. You owe him an apology right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy seemed taken aback, clearly surprised by Grace's anger for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, a more mocking smile spread across his face. "Heh, so now you're defending him, huh? You're saying he's not some random guy? I bet you two slept together. A slut's still a slut, no need to explain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Randy, this kind of woman isn't worth getting upset over. We'll introduce you to better ones. By the way, Solomia's red light district is great. You can spend a few thousand dollars there and have a much better time than with her. Why are you so cling to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A young man with colorful dyed hair sneered beside him, his gaze toward Grace full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, Randy, with your status, you could get any kind of woman you want. Why are you fixated on this girl? She's probably already been with this guy and isn't a virgin anymore. Let it go. There are plenty of other women for us to have fun with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another young man chimed in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they were talking to Randy, each of their remarks subtly insulted Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face darkened as she replied, "What nonsense are you talking about? If you have nothing better to do, just stay away from me. Seeing you makes me sick!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
