  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't the Luminara Awards supposed to be fair and impartial? What you're doing is downright unjust! Where does this leave the organizers, Royal Entertainment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe stood her ground, refusing to bow to pressure, her face dark with anger as she confronted the men before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had debuted at sixteen, spending the past eight years carving out a place for herself in the industry. And now, finally, she had a song that could cement her status as one of the country's top female artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Winning the Best Female Singer award at the Luminara Awards wouldn't just boost her prestige&mdash;it would send her booking fees skyrocketing and solidify her standing in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a female artist, this was a game-changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way she was going to just hand that award over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could say another word, a tall, imposing man struck her across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap landed with a sharp crack, instantly reddening and swelling one side of her face. If she hadn't been leaning against the parking garage wall, she would've been knocked to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You stupid bitch. You really don't know what's good for you, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sneered, "Let me spell it out for you&mdash;the one telling you to step aside is none other than Vice President Miles Donovan! And you're here talking about fairness? What fairness? You've been in this business for years. You really think this industry isn't rotten to the core? If you want fairness, go sleep with Mr. Donovan. Satisfy him, and forget Best Female Singer&mdash;you'll have awards thrown at you left and right. Hah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes shamelessly raked over Chloe's body as he chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe was undeniably one of the most beautiful women in Uswad's entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face, her figure&mdash;she was perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Miles had had his eye on her for a long time. He had hinted at his interest repeatedly, but Chloe had ignored him every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Evander, another executive vice president at Royal Entertainment, Miles had been with the company for years. He had far more connections, more influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, despite Evander being in charge of daily operations, it was Miles who truly held the power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not that he cared much about running the company. Miles' interests lay elsewhere&mdash;visiting sets, wining and dining actresses, and funneling company money into his own pockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being an executive VP, he was worth billions, and not just because of his Royal Entertainment salary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leveraging his position, he had set up multiple production companies, from short films to music studios, all while embezzling funds on the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with his personal fortune approaching the ten-billion mark, Miles was a true industry kingmaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he controlled numerous award shows, including this year's Luminara Awards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Royal Entertainment as the host, he was pulling all the strings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to turn a nobody into a Best Actor or Actress overnight, he could. And no one would dare object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the woman he wanted to push to the top was Selena Marlowe&mdash;a rising pop star with a handful of hit singles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her song Gravity had been dominating the charts, consistently ranking in the top three&mdash;right behind Chloe's Midnight Serenade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So if Miles forced Chloe to step aside, the audience wouldn't even have much room to protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Selena was popular in her own right. Just... not quite at Chloe's level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the man's words, Chloe's expression twisted with disgust. She clenched her jaw.</span><br><span>"You people are absolutely shameless," she spat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
