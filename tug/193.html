  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the powerful force, Harvey's mouth was severely injured. His teeth were broken, and the blood constantly oozed out, staining a large area of his clothes on his chest red!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Burnett..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alvin, who was not far away, started and turned pale at the sight of the tragedy.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a member of a branch, Harvey still represented the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was beaten badly, which was a disgrace to the Burnett family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Marcus was ruthless, showing no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he had said, Harvey's mouth was soon destroyed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips were swollen and turned outwards, and all his teeth were broken. His face looked unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was creepy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, Judy, and the other girls covered their mouths in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected things to escalate to this point!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, whom they had always admired, was now being brutally abused in his villa, and no one dared to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those thugs who had been beaten by Marcus could only watch helplessly. It was too cruel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey mumbled, "Country bumpkin... I-I will definitely kill you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what he had done before, Marcus could have taken his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Maxine's sake, he decided to spare his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus and Maxine were friends, and killing people from her family was a bit inhumane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After throwing Harvey to the ground casually, Marcus approached Natalia, who was already in a daze, and took her smooth hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded and mechanically walked out of the villa with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester finally reacted and hurried forward, asking respectfully, "Mr. Fitzgerald, where are you going? I'll take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and said, "No need. Tell the other three people to meet me at the presidential suite at the Hilton Hotel at ten o'clock tomorrow night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester nodded in agreement obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, standing beside Harvey, trembled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he was very glad that Marcus did not attack him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, his end would be miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why Marcus ignored him was simply because he was disdainful of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina came back to her senses and said, "Judy, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen girls nodded and left the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's experience completely shocked them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps from today on, their attitude towards Natalia would change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after everyone left did Peter dare to call an ambulance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey and some injured thugs were sent to Kingston Hospital for treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because his facial injuries were too severe, he underwent surgery that night. Even though the best plastic surgeon in Kingston was hired, his face probably wouldn't be able to recover to its peak condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning that Harvey had been beaten, his father, Donald Burnett, immediately returned to Kingston on a special plane from abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waking up from the surgery, he first asked Donald to avenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of his injuries, Donald felt extremely sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hatred reached its peak, and he vowed to avenge Harvey!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no idea of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Harvey's villa, he hailed a taxi to take Natalia back to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat in the back seat. She held his arm and leaned her head on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From time to time, she looked up at his handsome face with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you are heroic today. I like you very much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Natalia didn't like to cause trouble, it did feel good to be protected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, her admiration for Marcus grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "They are all powerless. I haven't shown my real strength yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I attended the party today to teach them a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his words, Natalia felt warm inside and blurted out, "Marcus, are you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Why am I jealous? I'm just afraid that they will harm you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia made a face at him and said, "Marcus, I thought you were jealous of Harvey. It seems that I misunderstood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed, "Am I such a fool in your eyes that anyone makes me jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia smiled happily, "You are right. Harvey is nothing. How could he make you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, where is the taxi going?" she asked, a little expectantly, her delicate face blushing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
