  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson was a cyborg, and even with his arm broken, he still felt intense pain. He let out a blood-curdling scream, his expression instantly turning to one of terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone </span><span>present</span><span> froze in shock. No one had imagined that, with the fight barely underway, Marcus would completely gain the upper hand. Maxine, in particular, was captivated, her eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly </span><span>Uswad</span><span> scum! How dare you break my arm? I'll kill you!" Gibson roared with fury, swinging his remaining hand viciously toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus saw it clearly&mdash;sharp claws sprouted from Gibson's fingers, aimed straight at his vitals. But Marcus was no ordinary opponent. Not only was he a formidable Ancient Martial Stage Three warrior, but he also wielded the power of a Wizard. A mere cyborg was nothing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus punched straight at Gibson's remaining arm, shattering its bones instantly. The overwhelming force sent Gibson flying, and another agonized wail tore from his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Gibson could react, Marcus was already upon him. Gibson struggled to rise but was slammed back to the ground by another punch, knocking him unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned. No one could have imagined that someone as powerful as Gibson would be so easily defeated by Marcus. As the onlookers stared in disbelief, Marcus pulled out a dagger and sliced open Gibson's abdomen. Moments later, a mechanical device the size of a watermelon, glowing with a red light, appeared before everyone's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... Gibson really is a cyborg. Eldoria is absolutely shameless, using a cyborg to compete against regular humans!" The crowd erupted in </span><span>outrage,</span><span> their scorn directed at Pete on the podium. Pete's face turned ashen; he had never expected Gibson to be no match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's face was equally grim as he demanded, "Mr. Hudson, how do you explain this? A normal combat match, and you send a cyborg into the ring? What is the meaning of this?" It was now clear to him why Edward had been so easily defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's expression darkened ominously. "A cyborg is still human! They represent Eldoria's superior technological prowess. What's wrong with that?" As he spoke, he abruptly stood, clearly intending to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Pete could take a step, Marcus' cold voice rang out behind him. "Stop right there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete froze, his expression sour, and turned back. "You've won the match. Gibson is dead. I have no reason to stay here. Mayor Benjamin, everyone, I'll take my leave now." With that, he turned to go, but Marcus grabbed his shoulder firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat beaded on Pete's forehead as he asked, "What are you doing? Are you trying to restrict someone's freedom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "Did you forget the bet we made earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flashed across Pete's face. "What bet? I don't know what you're talking about. Let me go now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to leave, leave an arm behind first." Without warning, Marcus slammed Pete's arm onto the table. Pete screamed in terror, struggling desperately to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa, standing nearby, called out in warning, "Marcus, Mr. Hudson is a direct heir of Eldoria's Hudson family. If you dare lay a finger on him, the Hudson family won't </span><span>let you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus paid no attention to her words. With a swift motion, the dagger came down&mdash;slash. A sickening sound accompanied Pete's arm being severed, blood spurting out in torrents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the crowd turned pale, some instinctively stepping back in fear. None of them had expected Marcus to actually follow through and cut off Pete's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus released Pete, who was barely conscious from the pain, and said icily, "You made the bet yourself. You should honor it. Now get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's face was ashen, his gaze filled with hatred as he glared at Marcus. "Marcus, mark my words! This grudge won't end here. I'll make you pay tenfold for this humiliation!" With Alyssa's support, Pete stumbled out of the arena, humiliated and defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire scene had unfolded so suddenly that the crowd was left stunned. It wasn't until a while later that thunderous applause broke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Pete had been insufferably arrogant&mdash;not only had he allowed Gibson to cripple Edward, but he had also openly insulted the people of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. Everyone had been holding onto their frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus defeat Gibson with his own hands, expose Pete's treachery, and even cut off Pete's arm, the crowd felt a collective release of their pent-up anger. They looked at Marcus with newfound admiration as though he were a hero.</span></p><div class="pagination">
