  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' single punch knocked back Nathan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent had reached the absolute peak of Ancient Martial Stage Seven, just one step away from advancing to Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that Nathan possessed an extraordinary ability to fight above his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his cultivation was much lower, he defeated a family elder at Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such strength was far beyond what ordinary people could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even with the advantage of a surprise attack, Nathan was pushed back by Marcus' casual punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from his appearance, Nathan seemed to have sustained some injuries. Could Marcus' power surpass Nathan's?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's blood boiled with rage, and his face darkened with displeasure. His eyes filled with disbelief as he stared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brows furrowed as his gaze swept over Nathan. "Before, I showed restraint because you were Ada's friend. I didn't expect you to take advantage of my courtesy. Since that's the case, let me show you what true power means!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus took a step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelmingly terrifying aura burst forth from Marcus' body. Heaven and earth seemed to change color instantly as fearsome coercion descended from the sky above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire space appeared to freeze at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan felt his body locked in place by the coercion, like a tiny leaf boat caught in a raging storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each wave threatened to drag him under, to swallow him whole!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned ghostly pale, cold sweat beading on his forehead as he stared at Marcus with growing terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel!" Marcus commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though barely above a whisper, the word crashed into Nathan's ears like the verdict of a final judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body trembled as primal fear gripped his very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His knees buckled, and he collapsed to the ground before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took another step forward, his crushing coercion intensifying as he looked down at Nathan like an ant beneath his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan couldn't take it anymore. He fell forward onto his hands, shaking uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great effort, he lifted his head to look at Marcus. "How... how is this possible? </span><span>How can you be this powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers stood frozen, stunned by the scene unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' oppressive coercion, everyone present felt suffocated. No one expected that even a casual display of Marcus' power would be too much for Nathan to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in strength between them was astronomical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, Marcus could easily take Nathan's life if he wished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he had mentioned, he had previously agreed to accept three moves from Nathan purely because of respect for Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had assumed that after taking those three hits, Nathan would keep his word and let the matter rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Nathan had chosen to continue the fight, attempting to strike Marcus underhandedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he realize that Marcus' power was far beyond his ability to challenge. He had essentially dug his own grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance at Nathan as he spoke, "An insect like you has no right to know my business. If you dare provoke me again, you'll pay dearly for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, Marcus walked over to Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada stood there, stunned by what she had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Nathan was no match for Marcus, but she hadn't expected the gap between them to be so vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant that Marcus had grown even more potent in just a few days she hadn't seen him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation shocked Ada even more. Not only was Marcus mighty, but the speed at which his strength increased was simply mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada finally snapped out of her daze and expressed her gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Why are you thanking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for sparing him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada knew Marcus had only let Nathan live because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's nothing but a pushover. Killing him wouldn't make any difference to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His casual exchange only made Nathan's heart colder as he stood far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been proud, never imagining that one day his life would be spared because a woman pleaded on his behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, this was the ultimate humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he had no choice but to swallow his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. During their earlier confrontation, he had truly experienced the terrifying extent of Marcus' power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was outmatched entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he wanted to tear Marcus to pieces, he was powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This massive gap in strength wasn't something he could overcome with sneak attacks or clever tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was stunned, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard rumors about Marcus before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he'd been somewhat skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought those rumors must have been exaggerated. Still, seeing it with his eyes, he realized they had understated reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Nathan was nothing compared to him</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>no wonder all those powerful fighters died at Marcus' hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a Swords Sect member approached Liam and whispered something in his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's face immediately darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news was about two Swords Sect elders killed in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the report, Marcus was the one who had killed them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage instantly flared up in Liam's heart, and his gaze turned ice-cold as he looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two elders had been pillars of the Swords Sect, having reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given time, they would have advanced to Ancient Martial Stage Seven, joining the ranks of the most elite fighters in the world of Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, both of them had fallen at Marcus' hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an enormous loss for the Swords Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be a lie to say Liam wasn't furious after receiving this news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Liam had to suppress the rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists were clenched, his jaw locked, and his face turned red as he tried to contain his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. Based on Marcus' recent display of power, no one in the Swords Sect could match him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Liam fought Marcus himself, he wouldn't fare any better than Nathan. He might even end up worse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under these circumstances, if he didn't control his temper and provoked Marcus, the entire Swords Sect might face a bloodbath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patriarch, is everything alright? You don't look well. Are you feeling sick?" asked one of the Ancient Martial Art family elders beside Liam, his voice full of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam smiled and said, "It's nothing, just an old condition. A few pills will take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the elder fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something still felt off about Liam's behavior, though he couldn't quite put his finger on it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
