  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said it before. I will only marry Marcus in this lifetime. Our Burnett family has a rule. Only the head of the family or my grandfather has the right to decide the marriage of the younger generation. Uncle Malcolm, although you're my elder, you have no right to decide my marriage life!" Maxine said stubbornly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's dominance had forced her to invoke the rule of the family to counter him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Maxine's words, Malcolm suddenly sneered, a wild, mocking grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with sarcasm as he looked at her and said, "You almost made me forget. Today, aside from your relatives, I also have an important announcement for all the distinguished people of Kingston!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this day forward, I am the head of the Burnett family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into stunned silence, many people unable to believe their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suspected that Malcolm was attempting to seize power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Malcolm to announce this publicly meant he had clearly prepared for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malcolm, what do you mean by this?" Owen's face darkened as he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Malcolm had always harbored ambitions to become the family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had even been willing to hand over the family's position to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, during Matthew's birthday banquet, with so many prominent figures from Kingston in attendance, Malcolm's sudden declaration seemed to overshadow the occasion and had the feeling of usurping control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen realized that this wasn't just about competing for the head of the Burnett family; Malcolm was aiming to publicly humiliate him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Owen, with his usually calm demeanor, was beginning to lose his temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, didn't you say yourself that you'd hand the family leadership over to me? Today, I'm just using this occasion to announce it. What's wrong with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm sneered, his tone dripping with provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, he had worked diligently for the Burnett family, building his own reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all this time, his shine had been overshadowed by Owen. Now, at this very moment, Malcolm was ready to vent all the resentment he had accumulated over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did say that, but you're announcing it in such a public manner, giving me no face. Don't you even see me as your older brother?" Owen's voice turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the entire banquet hall fell eerily silent. Everyone's gaze was fixed on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that a birthday celebration would turn into a battle for the head of the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, you've often said that face must be earned, not given by others. Why, then, have you forgotten your own words?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm said smugly, then turned his gaze to Matthew. "Father, you also promised me that you would fully support me in taking the position of family head. Please, speak up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words left Malcolm's mouth, the room erupted in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that Malcolm had secured Matthew's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Owen's position as the head of the Burnett family even more precarious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew sighed deeply, his gaze toward Owen filled with a touch of guilt. "Owen, I did promise Malcolm. Please don't be angry with me. I didn't want to see you two brothers fighting over this position and tearing the Burnett family apart. I hope you understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, a look of deep pain appeared on Owen's face. He clutched his chest and gasped for breath, his face turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, Owen... Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, Hazel, and Stella rushed over to support him, their faces full of worry and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm fine. It's just that I'm so heartbroken... my heart hurts so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he had agreed to hand the leadership over to Malcolm was because they were family. He believed that it didn't matter who held the position as long as they were all working for the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that Malcolm had been plotting for this position all along and that Matthew had even agreed to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What hurt him even more was that Malcolm had no regard for his face and had chosen to announce it publicly in front of everyone. It was as if he was deliberately humiliating him to establish himself as the new family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had always placed a great value on brotherly affection, even though he knew Malcolm was ambitious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been wary of Malcolm, but now, it was precisely because of his trust in their sibling bond that he found himself in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm sneered. "Owen, you can step down now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malcolm, your older brother has always wanted to give you the position of family head. Why are you being so aggressive? If you want it, take it!" Hazel said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I want more than just the position of family head. I want all of your and your wife's shares in the Burnett family businesses. Today, you must give them to me as well!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
