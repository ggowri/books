  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Defeat me and you'll know," Marcus said with a sneer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slowly rose up and confronted Alison in the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation had just broken through to the peak of Acquired Return Essence Realm level three, and he was still in a vague state about his own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could take this opportunity to test his strength with Alison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus knew that Alison was a Level Seven Demon Fighter a month ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a month, even if her strength improved, it would not be much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if she really encountered some miracle and her cultivation broke through the Level Seven Demon Fighter, Marcus would have a certain ability to protect himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in addition to Marcus' absolute confidence in his own strength, he could also teleport.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he couldn't beat her, he could run.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could teleport back to </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. Even if Alison wanted to chase him, it would be very difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing what Marcus said, Alison even thought she had heard it wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A strange look immediately appeared on her pretty face. She looked at Marcus as if looking at a fool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She then said sarcastically, "Are you having a fever or are you crazy? You don't think that you are qualified to compete with me just because you killed two of my men, do you? You saw my strength a month ago. How dare you be so arrogant to me now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Marcus could kill her two men in seconds, Alison felt that he would not be able to withstand her attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "You are pretty, with such big breasts, but no brains. Your vision is too narrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, Marcus raised his hand and made a small gesture.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a lot of teasing in Marcus' words that mocked her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison couldn't help but look down at her breasts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, as a girl, Alison knew the disadvantages of big breasts better than anyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were not as beautiful as they looked on the surface. They fell down when walking normally, especially when going down the stairs, which hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she had to wear a thicker bra than normal girls. Otherwise, it couldn't support this pair of huge breasts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, big breasts only looked good, and the rest were all disadvantages.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, after hearing what Marcus said, Alison even believed him a little.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was she really as brainless as he said?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she quickly suppressed this idea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said to Marcus, "I know you are sharp-tongued. You don't have to argue with me. Now I will show you what the true strength of a Level Seven Demon Fighter is!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, Alison's body was full of magic light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The purple-gold Magic Light surrounded her body, making her like a magic angel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her perfect face and hot body were even more charming and beautiful under the light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Alison waved her hand, and a strong purple-gold Magic Light descended on Marcus like a punishment from heaven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus licked his lips and seemed to be interested.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Fist Ray was directly blasted out and collided with the opponent's purple-gold Magic Light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rumbling sound of an explosion broke out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of destruction spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a fist of Marcus, the purple-gold destructive streamer exploded. His body was also shocked, and stepped back, and his arms were numb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's pretty face showed a bit of surprise. She didn't expect Marcus to be able to compete with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It seems that I underestimated your strength. But don't think that you can compete with me just by taking my attack. I only used 70% of my strength in the previous attack. If I'm serious, you will definitely not be able to compete with me!" Alison said to Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
