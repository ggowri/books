  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine couldn't really blame Marcus, though.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back at her own words, she felt utterly ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a sister, she had never been fair, always siding with her wealthy eldest sister to bully their poorest younger sibling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been the worst excuse for a middle sister and the most despicable one of all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This outcome was entirely her own doing, and she had no one else to blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, these thoughts filled Christine with bitter regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She especially regretted being such a social climber. If she hadn't been, Henry could have had a limitless future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the adult world, you have to face the consequences of your choices. She'd backed the wrong horse, and now she had to swallow this bitter pill alone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, there's no reason to stay here any longer. Let me take you both back to Solomia," Marcus said, turning to Richard and his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda nodded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This visit home had completely shattered any lingering attachments she had to her blood relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether she'd ever return was now uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drove off from Yolanda Village in his Alpha minivan with Richard and his family in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you were actually Mr. Fitzgerald's relatives," Jalen sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head in disgust. "And you managed to blow a winning hand completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Mr. Fitzgerald's status, one word from him could've set you up for life. But instead, you looked down on him like garbage, bullied and insulted him, totally ignored family ties. Serves you right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those parting words, Jalen left with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise collapsed to the ground, her eyes vacant and lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fall from grace would likely haunt their family for generations to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took Richard's family back to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Solomia Construction was the city's largest contractor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan's firing barely caused a ripple. Losing a project manager was nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when Jalen had him dumped in the river, no one batted an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this city where the underground world held sway, murders, and disappearances were just business as usual. It was too familiar for anyone to care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Marcus headed to the construction site for another inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was filled with anticipation about the completion of the pharmaceutical company's plant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he arrived, something was off - the crane had stopped moving, and the usual roar of heavy machinery was absent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large crowd of workers had gathered at the site entrance, clustered around something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pushed through the crowd and found several uniformed enforcement officers holding official sealing notices, lecturing the site manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This site is being shut down. You have three days to remove all cranes and equipment. No construction is permitted without approval from the enforcement bureau!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The site manager protested angrily. "Our construction is completely legal! What grounds do you have for shutting us down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enforcement officer sneered. "We received complaints about incomplete paperwork. The order came down from Kingston. I'm just doing my job, so don't yell at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The site manager turned to his secretary. "Bring our permits and documentation right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary scurried off and quickly returned with the paperwork, presenting it to the officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enforcement officer barely glanced at the documents before tossing them to a man in plain clothes standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug-like man, his face twisted in an ugly smirk, proceeded to tear up all the documents and throw them on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your paperwork's complete? I don't see anything. Guess it's not complete anymore, huh?" he said with a smug grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager suddenly realized they were being deliberately targeted. "I'm reporting you for abuse of power!" he declared defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached for his phone to make the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The law enforcement officer grabbed his wrist and sneered, "What's your monthly salary worth compared to your life? Listen carefully! This isn't your fight. These are direct orders from the Brown family of Kingston. Even if you work for Solomia Construction, you're no match for the Browns. Get it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager's face fell as the officer's words sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he knew about the Brown family. They were legendary in Uswad, a powerhouse you didn't mess with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His construction company, as big as it was, couldn't afford to get on their wrong side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning this, the site manager didn't dare say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jared sent you, didn't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's voice cut through the crowd as he approached the officer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the officer and the thug with the beefy face looked surprised. They hadn't expected this young man to figure it out so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug let out a cold laugh. "So what if he did? Your site's illegal and we're shutting it down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus's eyes turned to ice as he stared down the thug. "I'm giving you three seconds to get out of my sight. Go back and tell Jared to prepare himself. I'm coming for his head. Unless you'd rather deal with my anger right here, right now."</span></p><div class="pagination">
