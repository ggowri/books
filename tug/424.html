  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, in particular, looked utterly shocked, his face filled with disbelief. "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you saying you want to invest in me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes," Marcus said with a slight smile. "I want to start a logistics company. You have experience in the logistics field, and you've proven to be responsible, hardworking, and willing to put in the effort. You fit exactly what I'm looking for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya scoffed, clearly dismissive. "How much are you really going to invest? A hundred thousand? Two hundred thousand? Oh, I know the courier station down the street is up for sale&mdash;only 150 thousand dollars. But that place doesn't even make much money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Ramona and urged, "Ramona, just get that divorce with Darian over with. Jaxon's been fired, and I'll find you someone better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't react to Aniya's mocking. He simply continued, "Let's start with ten billion Uswadian coins. If you manage the business well and things go smoothly, I'll invest even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words hit like a bombshell, leaving Darian, Ramona, Kiera, and even Aniya frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten billion Uswadian coins? You're really going to invest ten billion in Darian? Is this for real? Do you even have that kind of money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya was completely flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten billion Uswadian coins. She'd never even seen that much money in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, she'd thought Jaxon's six-figure salary was impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Marcus could actually invest ten billion Uswadian coins, Darian's salary would surpass Jaxon's by far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya could hardly believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona and Kiera shared the same skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Darian and Marcus were barely acquaintances&mdash;no matter how rich Marcus might be, why would he invest such an amount in Darian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, too, thought he must have misheard. "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you serious? This isn't some kind of joke, is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled. "Of course not. Just give me a bank account number."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without thinking, Darian wrote down his bank account number and handed it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus quickly accessed the app on his phone. As a platinum user, his transfer limits were far higher than ordinary people's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than a second, ten billion Uswadian coins were transferred to Darian's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian stared at the successful transfer notification, frozen in shock. His whole body felt like stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten billion Uswadian coins... is this really happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian held the phone so tightly it almost slipped from his hands, his mind completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona, Kiera, and Aniya were all staring at Darian's phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they saw the overwhelming balance in his account, they too were utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their gaze toward Marcus had completely shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm leaving the logistics company setup to you. I trust you'll do well," Marcus continued, his tone confident. "Once the company's up and running, you'll be the CEO."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your salary will have two parts, a fixed annual salary of ten million Uswadian coins, plus a 5% commission on the company's net profits if they exceed five billion Uswadian coins. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked, his eyes steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The commission-based salary structure was designed to motivate managers and foster mutual benefits for both parties. The proposal hit like another thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten million Uswadian coins, plus a 5% commission on profits? Mr. Fitzgerald, is this for real? Isn't that a bit too much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian couldn't believe what he was hearing. The entire situation felt surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pinched his leg hard to make sure he wasn't dreaming. The pain confirmed that it was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not too much. If you successfully set up and manage the logistics company, your salary could increase even more down the line," Marcus replied with a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wasn't just investing to make a profit&mdash;he also wanted to secure better logistics services for his own business ventures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With online shopping booming, if he didn't have his own logistics company, he'd be at the mercy of others for deliveries&mdash;and shipping costs were steep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By having his own company, he could reduce costs and provide a better experience for consumers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had been thinking about this for a while, but until now, he didn't know anyone in the logistics field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian may have been just a delivery driver, but Marcus had noticed his solid work ethic, integrity, and determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These qualities were far more valuable than a fancy degree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald, for believing in me. I promise I'll build this company and make it a success!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian bowed deeply, the gratitude in his heart overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though he had only been a delivery driver, he had worked hard in the industry for five years. He knew the ins and outs of the business, and more importantly, he wasn't lacking in ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He may not have had the formal education, but he wasn't ignorant&mdash;he'd just been forced to work in this job to support his family.</span></p><div class="pagination">
