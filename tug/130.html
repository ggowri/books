  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen was so terrified that he broke out in a sweat again, finally letting out a sigh of relief once Marcus walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius was soon taken to the hospital. As Stephen stood by the bedside, watching his nephew, battered and bruised from his own hands, his heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Stephen, who is Marcus, and why are you so scared of him?" Julius asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen gestured for Julius to lower his voice, as if worried someone might overhear. He leaned in and whispered a few words into Julius's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius's eyes widened in shock, his expression a mix of disbelief and fear. "Uncle Stephen, you mean this Marcus is Death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through Stephen as he quickly covered Julius's mouth. "Shh! This is something you must never share. You can't even speak Death's name out loud, or we'll both be dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius was horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it made sense why Stephen had struck him in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called useless freeloader Abigail had mentioned was actually Death, who had appointed Stephen as the new president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius realized he was almost badly hurt by Abigail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he continued to listen to Abigail and completely offended Death, he would definitely be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth in frustration, resentment toward Abigail growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail had already been kicked out of the Andrade family by Stephen and was wandering aimlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she had snagged a wealthy boyfriend in Julius and could brag about him to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she know that the wealthy bachelor she was eyeing paled in comparison to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus was no longer the chairman of Golden Group, he had become someone whom Stephen had to treat with utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit Abigail hard: Marcus was now beyond her reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their worlds were entirely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had provoked him, only to end up humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, on the other hand, brushed off the incident. To him, it was just a minor hiccup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His real concern was whether the other three presidents he had appointed faced the same issues as Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would their families and descendants be as useless as Julius?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want his subordinates to flaunt their status based on what they inherited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus decided he needed to investigate thoroughly soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by, and after spending three more days at Josie's place, Marcus prepared to return to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had a lot of things to do over there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Josie was reluctant to see him go, she had no choice but to let him leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus promised to visit Josie and Leia in Kingston when he had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie drove him to the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had to leave before his flight took off to attend to important clients at the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's eyes lingered on Josie's figure as she walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his distraction, he collided with a tall girl with long hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a softness against his chest and, upon turning around, realized his right hand was inadvertently touching the girl's breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed with anger as she glared at Marcus, shouting, "What are you doing? Get your hands off me right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled awkwardly, quickly retracting his hand and apologizing, "I'm really sorry! I wasn't paying attention!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-haired girl sized him up, disdain flashing in her eyes. "I think you did that on purpose, you pervert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she raised her voice deliberately, drawing the attention of those around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned but remained calm. "Please don't misunderstand, Miss. I wasn't watching where I was going. I'm truly sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is a simple apology enough? I've seen your type before! You see a girl and get all inappropriate. Don't even think of arguing with me!" the girl shouted, her voice escalating as she looked at Marcus with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt his patience wane. "What do you want me to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been so focused on Josie just now that he didn't see the person coming toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come with me to the police station so they can handle this!" she insisted, grabbing his arm and dragging him toward the airport police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling helpless, Marcus followed her to the police station where he gave his statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After assessing the situation, the police quickly determined that Marcus hadn't acted intentionally, giving him just a verbal warning before letting him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the delay, Marcus barely made it onto his flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his dismay, he found himself seated next to the long-haired girl again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you again, pervert!" she spat, glaring at him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
