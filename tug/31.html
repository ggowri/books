  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric gritted his teeth, seething with rage as he threatened Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus leaned in closer, his voice a low whisper that cut through the tension like a knife. "I'm the third son of the Godfather, the chosen heir. Anyone who stands in my way will die&mdash;starting with you. Even my two brothers aren't safe from my wrath."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those chilling words hanging in the air, Marcus snapped Eric's neck in one swift motion. Eric's eyes widened in shock, his gaze freezing in place as life slipped away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew what thoughts raced through his mind in those final moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus showed no mercy to someone so stubbornly defiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the place, taking in the dozens of thugs surrounding him before his gaze landed on Bob. "This is your last chance. Will you submit to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric's death served as a stark warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their fierce demeanor, Bob and the others were not foolish enough to confront death head-on. One by one, they bowed their heads in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Natalia leaped out of a nearby window, her eyes widening in shock as she took in the sight of Eric's lifeless body and the subservient posture of Bob and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Marcus is truly incredible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to the Serpent's Coil headquarters!" Marcus commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serpent's Coil was one of the three major gangs in Solomia's underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also Bruce's covert influence in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Cyan Serpent Lodge, the atmosphere was tense, with the high-ranking members of Serpent's Coil gathering for an important meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the head of the table sat Tory Turner, the president of Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his fifties, Tory exuded an air of authority that made him seem more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His presence was more akin to that of a sage than a typical crime lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bruce Gellar has ordered us to unify the underground world of Solomia within three months. What progress have we made?" Tory asked, scanning the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Seven Stars Association stepped forward to report. "Mr. Turner, since receiving Mr. Bruce Gellar's orders, we have absorbed thirty-four gangs of various sizes and expanded our territory eastward by over ten miles. We've recruited over a thousand new members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're closing in on the Wild Wolf Gang's territory and will start encroaching on them within a month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied smile crept onto Tory's face. "At this rate, we'll be the sole power in Solomia within a year, and I, Tory, will be at the top of the underground hierarchy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a wild laugh, a stark contrast to his composed demeanor, the sound echoing off the walls with manic energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the laughter faded, Tory's gaze swept across the room, only to notice Eric's empty seat. "Where's Eric? How could he miss such an important meeting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone spoke up, "Eric's men were attacked, and he went out for revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tory's brow furrowed. "Who dares to touch my men in Charaling District? When he returns, tell him to come see me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold voice rang out from the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't be coming back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to see a tall figure striding confidently into the lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Marcus, with Bob trailing behind him, looking nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you to barge into my Serpent's Coil?" Tory demanded, his icy gaze locking onto Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who I am isn't important. There's a question you need to answer," Marcus replied, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tory raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement flickering across his face. "Interesting. It's been a long time since someone dared to speak to me like that. I find it quite entertaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in a good mood today, so ask your question. After I answer, I'll let you die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your relationship with Bruce, the Godfather's eldest son?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tory was taken aback; he hadn't expected this young man, who looked to be in his early twenties, to mention Bruce right off the bat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he felt no need to hide the truth, convinced that Marcus was already a dead man in his eyes. "I'm a subordinate of Mr. Bruce Gellar. The entire Serpent's Coil operates under his command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Then you can die," Marcus replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a flash, he leaped forward, his body a blur as he charged at Tory like an arrow released from a bow!</span></p><div class="pagination">
