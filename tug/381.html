  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy and his group came back, now accompanied by several men dressed like thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy's friends were swinging their clubs, smashing Marcus' Aston Martin hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Aston Martin was instantly covered in dents and looked terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A crowd gathered, pointing and whispering about them, but no one dared to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marcus arrived, Randy and his group immediately stopped and smirked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You sure have guts not to leave. Perfect, today I'm gonna break all your teeth and disable your limbs to settle this score!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy's face was swollen, and he spoke to Marcus in a muffled voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes gleamed sharply as he sneered, "I didn't hurt your vital spots before because I didn't want Grace to see the blood. Did you really think I was scared of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young men laughed coldly. They had brought along members from the Solariae branch of the Black Tiger Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leading them was a middle-aged man with a thick beard, Nicholas Bates, the boss of the Solomia branch of the Black Tiger Gang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Marcus was strong, he wasn't a match for these underground guys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nicholas, handle this guy for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A young man with red hair said, having been beaten by Marcus before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His family was influential in Solariae, worth billions of dollars, and he had never faced such trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, I got this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas replied confidently, looking at Marcus with a cold gaze. "You messed with the wrong people, especially these heirs. Even if God came today, He couldn't save you. Kneel and apologize to the heirs, and break your own hands and legs, and I might spare your life. Otherwise, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Nicholas threw a dagger at Marcus, looking proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd around them chatted and looked at Marcus with pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The underground world of Solomia was rampant, and ordinary people didn't dare get involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought this young man was in big trouble today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you with the Black Tiger Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked casually, thinking of Tony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last time he went to Solariae to buy guns, Tony had helped him, making everything go smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, since you know I'm with the Black Tiger Gang, why don't you take care of it yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas laughed even more wildly. The Black Tiger Gang was expanding into nearby cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Solomia branch had only been established three months ago but already had its own territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though it couldn't compare to the top underground groups like the Serpent's Coil or the Death Syndicate, they kept to themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tony set up branches in other cities not to take over territory but to handle more business. You went behind their backs, standing up to other local gangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Think about how Tony would handle you if he knew what you did!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he talked with Tony in Solariae, he heard about Tony's plans to set up branches in other cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, Marcus thought Tony was very forward-thinking, so he didn't stop him from setting up the Solomia branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected these guys would actually take Solomia as their own territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas' face darkened. He didn't expect this guy to know so much about their gang's internal matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he came to Solomia, Tony had warned him not to make himself known locally and to be careful about getting into conflicts with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless someone else provoked them, they weren't allowed to cause trouble on the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They especially weren't allowed to bully others under the name of the Black Tiger Gang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas had come with Randy and the others solely because they offered him enough benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Driven by money, he thought handling Marcus alone would be quick and easy. Tony wouldn't find out, and he could make a good profit. Why not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus had figured it all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nicholas, stop wasting time with this guy. Let's take action and cripple him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the subordinates suggested that Marcus should not be expected to know so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finish this now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas showed a determined look and waved to his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The subordinates immediately got ready, stepping towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Randy and the other young men smirked, waiting to watch Marcus get beaten up by the Black Tiger Gang members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at that moment, Nicholas' phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned, picked up the call, and was about to curse when a familiar voice came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nicholas, why is there no one at the branch? Where the hell have you been!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The caller was Tony, who had also come to Solomia!</span></p><div class="pagination">
