  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately agreed. "Mom, don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. I'll head over soon so you two don't have to go through the trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, an image of Nicole's bright, youthful face flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she started college, Marcus had barely seen her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it now, he realized how much he missed her&mdash;and how he hadn't really been the best big brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could've easily sent someone else to move her things, but this time, he wanted to do it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was his responsibility as her brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus first stopped by Bayside Villa, swapping his Aston Martin for his Toyota Alphard, which had more space for luggage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he drove straight to Solomia Institute of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, he texted Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told him that, since it was winter break, the school's main gate was open, and security wouldn't be checking visitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could just drive in directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following her instructions, Marcus parked outside the girls' dormitory and called her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No answer. He called again. Still no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several tries, his calls kept going unanswered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned. Feeling a little uneasy, he decided to head upstairs and bring down her luggage himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he stepped into the dormitory entrance, a figure suddenly blocked his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you think you're going? This is the girls' dormitory. Don't you know the rules? Or are you trying to do something shady?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked up and saw a young woman, about twenty-four or twenty-five, standing in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had glasses perched on her nose, a neatly pressed teacher's uniform, and an air of intellectual authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was smooth and flawless, her figure tall and elegant, her curves perfectly balanced between sophistication and allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without makeup, she radiated a quiet, understated beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious&mdash;she was a teacher at Solomia Institute of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly smiled politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm here to pick up my sister," he explained. "She's moving out for winter break, and I'm helping her carry her things. She hasn't been answering her phone, so I was going to head up and check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole had already told him that most of the students had already left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her dorm was practically empty, and she was the only one left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Marcus had decided to go upstairs himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the dorms were still packed with students, he never would've considered entering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the young teacher wasn't having it. "I don't care what your reason is," she said sternly. "This is a female dormitory. You know the rules, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was serious, her posture firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was young, she had the kind of commanding presence that left no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew she had a point, so he didn't argue back. With an apologetic smile, he said, "I understand your concerns, but my sister told me that her dorm is almost completely empty&mdash;she's the only one left. Otherwise, I wouldn't have even considered going up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the teacher wasn't convinced. "I don't care why you're here," she said firmly. "The fact remains that you're trying to enter a female dormitory. That alone is reason enough to report you to security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, narrowing her eyes, she added, "You keep saying you have a sister&mdash;but how do I know you're not just making that up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sighed and rolled his eyes. "I'm not a pervert," he muttered. "My sister's name is Nicole Fitzgerald. If you don't believe me, go check the student records."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher's eyes flickered slightly. "No need to check," she said. "Nicole is one of my students."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She crossed her arms and added, "Since you're really her brother, you should know the school rules. A man shouldn't be trying to barge into the girls' dorms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could see that arguing would get him nowhere, so he simply nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he just wanted to grab Nicole's luggage and leave&mdash;the sooner, the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that arguing with this strict, by-the-book teacher would be completely pointless&mdash;there was no way to win against someone like her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
