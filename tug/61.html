  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stared at the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man revealed a cruel smile and said, "You are very clever. "I am Chetak Duncan. Falcon was my junior. You killed him, and I must make you pay the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Chetak spoke, he approached Marcus step by step, his aura continuously rising. "You managed to kill Falcon, so your cultivation must have reached Ancient Martial Stage One, but in front of me, you are still not even worth mentioning. It's best for you to accept your fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cultivating ancient martial arts was a tedious and monotonous endeavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Advancing to each realm required a very long period of suffering and waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some powerful warriors, after a lifetime of cultivation, only managed to reach ancient martial stage two or three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ascend to higher realms, in addition to ample time, factors such as comprehension, opportunity, and resources were all crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falcon died at Marcus's hands half a month ago. According to the information Chetak received, Marcus' cultivation at that time might not have been on par with Falcon's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by his inference, even after half a month, he didn't expect Marcus' cultivation to have made significant progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to avenge Falcon, Chetak rushed back to Uswad from Weston Land and, after much investigation, finally pinpointed Marcus' location and followed him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really don't understand where your confidence comes from," Marcus said with a face full of irony, looking at Chetak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chetak stopped smiling, his gaze becoming increasingly sharp. "It seems you're not prepared to end it yourself, so don't blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Chetak took a step forward, his body charging at Marcus like a beast. His massive fist suddenly smashed towards Marcus's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch contained an extremely terrifying force, much stronger than that of an ordinary Ancient Martial Stage Two warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that Chetak was a warrior known for his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus didn't care at all. His cultivation had now reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the mysterious power of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, his strength was much greater than that of his peers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Chetak's fierce attack, he had no intention of dodging and instead punched out as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two energy lights collided in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chetak's face wore a sarcastic smile, completely unexpected that Marcus would dare to confront his attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Does this guy not know that I am at Ancient Martial Stage Two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the energy of their punches intensified, Chetak's smile completely froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt an irresistible force transmit through his fist into his body, causing his body to tremble violently and his muscles and bones to suffer severe damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Chetak resisted with all his might, he couldn't hold on. With a muffled hum, his body was directly shaken and flew out, spitting out blood when he landed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ancient Martial Stage Two, how is this possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's only been half a month. How could your cultivation have reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Two!" Chetak looked at Marcus, who was walking towards him step by step, his eyes full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his cognition, no one could cultivate so quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think that the person in front of him was definitely a freak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were quite arrogant before, weren't you?" Marcus came to Chetak with a sarcastic smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I underestimated you. I have been in the warrior world for many years, and I never thought I would stumble into a ditch one day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want kill me, do as you please. If I frown, I'm not a man!" With that, Chetak actually closed his eyes, waiting for death to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, not expecting Chetak to be such a tough guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't make a move but said to Chetak, "I respect you, you can go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chetak opened his eyes in surprise and asked, "You're not going to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "If you don't leave now, I might change my mind at any time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chetak looked deeply at Marcus, then saluted him and said, "Thank you for sparing my life. I will remember this in my heart. However, if I have the chance in the future, I will still avenge Falcon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he covered his chest and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spared Chetak's life, not only because he was not afraid to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, this person avenged Falcon without using any conspiracies or deceit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Marcus had been entwined with Michelle earlier, and if Chetak had ambushed them at that moment, it would have been much easier to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chetak did not do so, choosing instead to confront Marcus directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not believe that someone like Chetak, who was a warrior for many years, would lack this intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that this person usually acted in an upright and straightforward manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For such a person, Marcus was willing to give him a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the Alphard business car, Michelle had already regained her previous elegance and had touched up her makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you alright?" Michelle asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over Michelle's attractive body, and the desire in his eyes flickered again, wanting to repeat the previous story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Michelle bit her lip and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I've started my period..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Marcus was helpless and immediately felt disappointed. "Weren't you just fine? You said you were in your ovulation period. How could it come suddenly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle said shyly, "I've been taking some medicine to regulate my body recently, and my period has always been unstable. Sometimes it's delayed and sometimes early. It's so annoying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed and said, "Don't you know that men are the best tonic for women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle could understand what Marcus meant and became even more shy, whispering, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll wait for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slapped Michelle's buttocks and said, "I didn't expect you to be so understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus got into the driver's seat and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was a bit uncomfortable now, he didn't want to hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he sent Michelle home, and then he returned to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he entered the door, he found Jane wearing a transparent nightgown on the sofa, taking care of her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus come back, Jane's face showed a pleasant surprise. "Marcus, where have you been these days? It's hard for me to see you, where have you been again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dealing with some things," Marcus replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over Jane's plump body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of transparent nightgown gave a hazy feeling, which could arouse his desire to explore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Marcus' slightly hot gaze, Jane deliberately leaned her body towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of a mature woman entered his nostrils, making Marcus' desire even stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lower body uncontrollably protruded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's eyes were very sharp, and she immediately noticed the change in Marcus' body. She whispered in Marcus's ear, sticking out her tongue and gently licking Marcus's earlobe, and said, "Honey...Do you want to fuck me? We haven't had sex for a long time. What are you waiting for?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
