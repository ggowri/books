  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus counted to three, the doors to the operating room suddenly swung open!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade walked out quickly, pulling off her mask to reveal her strikingly beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took a deep breath, looking utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha, look at her sighing like that! The surgery must have failed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! Even Jayden couldn't pull this off, let alone someone like Jade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like we're in for some entertainment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd buzzed with chatter, their eyes full of mockery as they looked at Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Secretly, they couldn't wait to see Marcus kneel and bark like a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, go ahead and keep your promise&mdash;resign already!" Freya sneered, her face smug with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Jade step out, Freya wasted no time, sneering triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden chimed in, "Don't worry, Freya. If she doesn't resign, I'll make sure she's fired!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade gave them a peculiar look. "What makes you think I should resign? Who told you the surgery failed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At her words, both Freya and Jayden froze momentarily before smirking sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought they must've misheard her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya scoffed, "Don't tell me the surgery was a success. That's simply impossible! I suggest you stop lying, or you'll be exposed soon enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade chuckled coldly. "Why don't you go check for yourself instead of asking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya and Jayden exchanged a glance and hurried into the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They found the patient lying calmly on the bed, both legs wrapped in pristine white bandages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since orthopedic surgeries couldn't be visually assessed, Jayden immediately called for diagnostic equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the examination progressed, his expression shifted from disdain to utter shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The recovery is complete... It's actually complete! How is this possible? How did Jade manage to do this?" he stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden's voice trembled as he continued examining the patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was etched with disbelief as he rubbed his eyes involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet the results on the screen were undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya heard Jayden's words, and her face went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hastily grabbed the device to check for herself, and she was dumbfounded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade... actually succeeded? How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Freya felt like she must be dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a nearly impossible surgery, yet Jade had performed it flawlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, it was more shocking than seeing the sun rise in the west.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jayden, how did Jade do this? Based on her skills, this surgery should've been impossible," Freya asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden shook his head. "I'm not entirely sure, but my guess is that Jade must have been guided by an expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The incision, stitching, anti-inflammation, and debridement techniques were flawless. There's no way Jade did this on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even I can't compare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya muttered to herself, "An expert... Who could have been guiding Jade?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya couldn't figure it out and left the operating room with Jayden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jayden, Freya, what did you see? Was the surgery a success?" Jade asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden looked embarrassed but had no choice but to nod and admit the surgery was a success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya, unwilling to concede, said, "Jade, sure, the surgery succeeded, but it's clearly not your work. Someone must have guided you, so it doesn't count!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suggest you resign before Jayden fires you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly. "Shouldn't you be the one resigning? How dare you tell Jade to quit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Marcus' words, Freya's expression immediately soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who do you think you are? What gives you the right to demand my resignation? I'm a certified doctor at Solomia Hospital. You have no authority to question me!" Freya snapped coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared icily, conveniently ignoring the bet they had made earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't we just make a bet? You said you'd resign if Jade succeeded. Why are you going back on your word so quickly?" Marcus questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya's eyes darted nervously, and she put her hands on her hips. "When did I make a bet with you? Do you have proof? Besides, it was just verbal&mdash;it's not legally binding. I still say Jade should be the one to resign!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya's ability to twist the truth was impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the other doctors and nurses watching weren't surprised&mdash;they had seen her manipulation skills before.</span></p><div class="pagination">
