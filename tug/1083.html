  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? Do you really think just being good at fighting makes you my equal?" Garrick's voice dripped with arrogance as he stared at Marcus like he was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana despised Garrick and Sebastien, but she couldn't deny that Garrick had a point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, brute strength alone wasn't enough to get ahead. To truly stand at the top, you needed wealth, power, and connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus might be strong, but compared to someone like Garrick, who was deeply embedded in high society, he seemed completely outmatched. And it wasn't just Morgana who thought so&mdash;the crowd murmured in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "A company worth 100 billion Uswadian coins, huh? I'll make a call and buy Faust Properties right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words had barely left Marcus' mouth when the entire room fell into stunned silence. People exchanged puzzled glances, unsure if they had misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One man stammered, "Wait... what did he just say? Did he say he's going to buy Faust Properties? Am I hearing things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You heard him right. He said he'd buy Faust Properties. And not just that&mdash;he said he'd do it with a single phone call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted from the crowd. "That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. I thought he was just a good fighter, but turns out he's a delusional braggart too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're talking about a company worth 100 billion Uswadian coins! And he thinks he can buy it with a phone call? Does he even know how business works?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! One hundred billion Uswadian coins&mdash;that's real money. Who does he think he is, some kind of god?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mocking looks were thrown Marcus' way, and even those who had initially admired him felt secondhand embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana gave him a strange look as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her understanding, Nicole had grown up in a remote village in Solomia, which meant her brother, Marcus, came from the same background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone with that kind of upbringing couldn't possibly have the wealth or power to buy a massive corporation like Faust Properties. The idea was beyond absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, even Garrick thought he had misheard. But when he realized Marcus was dead serious, he couldn't help but laugh.</span><br><span>This guy actually thought he could buy the company I have spent years building with a single phone call?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an amused smirk, Garrick looked Marcus up and down. "You sure you're not just running your mouth? Faust Properties is worth 100 billion, not 100 bucks. You might be able to fight, but throwing around nonsense like that&mdash;aren't you afraid of making a fool of yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance at him. Instead, he calmly said, "100 billion? That's nothing. Give me five minutes, and Faust Properties will be under my name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick blinked, momentarily thrown off. Then he burst into laughter, "Five minutes? Alright, I'll play along. I'll give you five minutes to buy my company. But if you fail, I'll call Regis over and have you locked up for the next decade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, Marcus took out his phone and dialed Michelle's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle was in a meeting at Golden Group when she received Marcus' call. Without hesitation, she stepped out of the conference room and listened attentively to his instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she heard Marcus wanted to acquire Faust Properties, a look of excitement flashed across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no surprise&mdash;Golden Group had been actively expanding its real estate division, having recently acquired multiple plots of land in Solomia for new developments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faust Properties, while not as large as Golden Group, was a well-established real estate firm with a solid reputation built over years of operation. It was one of Golden Group's strongest competitors in the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle had been considering acquiring Faust Properties for some time, but without Marcus' approval, she hadn't dared to make a move. Now, he was personally instructing her to go through with it. It was exactly what she had been hoping for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a second, Michelle set things in motion. In the end, the deal was finalized at 110 billion, and Faust Properties became a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything settled, Marcus ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick watched him hang up, the smirk on his face growing even more condescending. "Are you done pretending? That took three minutes&mdash;only two left. If you can't deliver on your ridiculous promise, get ready for prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was just as skeptical.</span><br><span>Buying a 100-billion-dollar company in five minutes? It sounds like pure fantasy. It isn't just about money&mdash;it requires an entire team of experts and a massive corporate infrastructure to pull off something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And this guy? He doesn't look like someone with that kind of influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as they were concerned, what Marcus was claiming was about as realistic as humans colonizing Mars overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before anyone could dwell on it further, a notification sound suddenly chimed from Garrick's phone. It was a text message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More spam messages? These things are so damn annoying," he muttered, unlocking his phone out of habit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment he saw the screen, his entire body tensed. It wasn't spam. It was an official notification: [Faust Properties Ownership Transfer Notice: As of 11:38 AM, 100% of Faust Properties' shares have been transferred in full to Marcus Fitzgerald.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick's hands trembled as he stared at the message, convinced he had to be seeing things. He rubbed his eyes hard, but no matter how many times he looked, the words on the screen didn't change. A wave of panic crashed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... this has to be a mistake. There's no way. My company... actually got sold? What the hell is going on?" His voice wavered, but the reality on his phone was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This hit Garrick like a ton of bricks, and he couldn't help but blurt out, "Who... who the hell is Marcus Fitzgerald? Someone actually paid 110 billion to buy my entire company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was completely stunned by Garrick's reaction, their bodies practically frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus had claimed he would acquire 100% of Faust Properties in just five minutes, no one had taken him seriously. Some had even openly mocked him, throwing out sneers and sarcastic remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here they were&mdash;less than five minutes later&mdash;watching Garrick receive confirmation that the company had, in fact, been sold.</span><br><span>Could this really just be a coincidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana, too, was in complete shock. She turned to Nicole, her voice almost a whisper. "Nicole, what's your brother's name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole answered instinctively, "My brother? His name is Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit Morgana like a lightning strike. Her wide, beautiful eyes reflected nothing but disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It was him. He had actually done it. In just five minutes, he had bought Faust Properties&mdash;in full. That was 110 billion. And he has acquired it with nothing more than a single phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was beyond anything Morgana could comprehend.</span><br><span>Isn't Nicole's family supposed to be from a small rural town? How could they possibly have this kind of money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind spun in circles, desperately trying to make sense of it all, but no matter how hard she tried, there was no logical explanation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
