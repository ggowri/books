  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than five minutes later, Mia had fully recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the powerful healing effects of Marcus' Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, Mia's cancer cells were completely eradicated. Even the two-thirds of her stomach that had been removed earlier had grown back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Mia was no different from a healthy person and soon woke up in her hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's awake! The patient is awake! He actually saved her life! What kind of method is this? I've never seen anything like it!" one doctor shouted with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you're awake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie rushed to her mother's bedside and held her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia looked at Natalie, a warm smile appearing on her face. "Natalie, I think I just had a long dream. I dreamed that I was about to die. But then, a young man pulled me back and healed my illness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement left everyone in the room stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all highly educated professionals in modern medicine, so naturally, they didn't believe in any unscientific practices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the scene in front of them kept reminding them that what they considered unscientific at times couldn't always be compared to modern medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia was clearly describing a dream, but it seemed to match the reality she had just experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of science could explain such a phenomenon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it was this young man! He saved me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Mia looked at Marcus, and her eyes lit up with excitement. "Young man, come here! Let me take a good look at you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward, and Mia took his hand with a look of deep gratitude. "Thank you, young man. You saved my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand with a smile. "No need to thank me, Mrs. Vance. I was Natalie's high school classmate. I even visited your house back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia looked surprised for a moment and then seemed to remember. "Oh, I remember now. Your name is Marcus, right? Back then, you seemed to like Natalie. I didn't approve because you were too young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're both grown. If you'd like, I can let Natalie marry you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's face immediately turned bright red. She said, "Mom, what are you saying? Marcus and I just met at a class reunion. He found out you were sick, so he asked me to bring him to the hospital to see you. It's not what you think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her daughter embarrassed, Mia stopped teasing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the other doctors had no time to listen to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wheeled in various medical instruments and began conducting a full-body examination of Mia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This event even reached the ears of the deputy hospital director, Gavin, who was on duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A patient, in critical condition after a cancer surgery with severe blood loss, had miraculously woken up. And all her physical indicators were back to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nothing short of a medical miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a series of tests, they were stunned to discover that not only had Mia's bodily functions returned to normal, but even the two-thirds of her stomach that had been surgically removed had grown back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia now had a fully restored stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone present was stunned, unable to believe this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gavin was in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been practicing medicine for decades. Though I work in a district hospital, I've attended many international academic forums. But I've never heard of someone not only saving a cancer surgery patient who was hemorrhaging but also regrowing an organ that had been removed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not a medical skill at all. It's the legendary magic!" Gavin said with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the consistent results from all the instruments, he would have never believed this was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was once again stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Marcus pulling her mother back from the brink of death was already a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that her mother's stomach, which had been removed years ago, could grow back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Natalie look at Marcus with new eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she felt that Marcus had been too modest in the things he had said before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not just curing cancer. It was more like possessing the ability to bring people back to life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master Healer, I had no idea you had arrived at our hospital. Please forgive me for not greeting you properly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin bowed deeply to Marcus, his face filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand. "I'm not Master Healer. You don't need to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin continued to bow, saying, "If I'm not mistaken, you must be the Master Healer who has performed several miracles in the medical field of Uswad recently. There's no one else I can think of who could have such amazing abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't deny it and simply nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his reaction, the doctors who had been part of Mia's rescue trembled in awe.</span></p><div class="pagination">
