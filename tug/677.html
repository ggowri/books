  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno nodded and launched a fierce punch towards Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force behind it was so potent that the Fist Ray it generated was even more formidable than the punch he had unleashed during his battle against Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take the punch of mine. It can cripple you. How dare you still be so arrogant in front of me?" Moreno sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fist soon approached Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seized Moreno by the wrist. Moreno narrowed his eyes and struggled to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exerted force and hurled Moreno away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dark face, Moreno had never expected that Marcus' counterattack would be so clever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, aided by the inertia of his Fist Ray, threw him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno clutched the pillar at the perimeter of the ring to keep himself from tumbling off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules, Moreno had left the ring area, which meant he had lost the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he showed no inclination whatsoever to abide by the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon returned to the ring and charged at Marcus. "Damn, how dare you play dirty tricks on me? I must beat you to pieces today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene immediately sparked protests from the members of the Iron Fist Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno's actions had violated the rules of the ring, but he still attacked Marcus. How shameless Moreno was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still stood there calmly without revealing his true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Moreno landed, Marcus advanced his right foot, which happened to block Moreno's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Moreno suddenly lost his balance and fell heavily on the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers' eyes grew wide, and they were left astounded by how incredibly fast Marcus' reaction was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' use of Moreno's force and his attempt to trip him with his feet were both clever moves, and they caused great damage to Moreno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a heavyweight fighter, Moreno tipped the scales at over 275 pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed heavily onto the ring, and it was quite a while before he could regain his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone from the Apis Boxing Club was sullen, never anticipating that such a guy would suddenly appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being teased by Marcus in such a manner, Moreno was instantly consumed by anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enduring the pain, he rose and said through gritted teeth, "You dare to plot against me. I must kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Moreno was ready to dash towards Marcus again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the ring, Dutton Carroll, the owner of the Apis Boxing Club, waved at Moreno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he glanced at Marcus and stated, "Didn't you propose to take on all the members of the Apis Boxing Club just now? I will do as you wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Dutton made a gesture to everyone from the Apis Boxing Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They immediately grasped his intention and rushed towards the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of this scene, Ophelia clenched her fists. It had never crossed her mind that Dutton would be so unsportsmanlike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that Moreno was no match for Marcus, Dutton promptly changed his strategy and asked everyone to fight Marcus together. How unscrupulous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was about to argue with Dutton when Shannon stopped her. "Ms. Perkins, never mind. Mr. Fitzgerald can handle these guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was somewhat skeptical, but since Shannon said so, Ophelia could only wait and see for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You asked for it</span><span>. If anything happens to you later, don't blame us for being too heartless," Moreno sneered at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows and said, "In that case, why don't we fight without rules? Otherwise, it will be boring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His suggestion stunned everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, many of them put on sarcastic faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A member of the Apis Boxing Club sneered and said, "I truly can't fathom where this fellow derives his courage. He dares to challenge so many of us single-handedly and even eagerly requests a fight without rules. Isn't this no different from seeking his own destruction?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Does he really believe that he can act so cocky just because Moreno is no match for him? He has no idea that everyone from the Apis Boxing Club is on a par with Moreno in terms of strength. If we join forces against him, he will definitely be black and blue in a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia and all the members of the Iron Fist Club were worried about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them wondered why Marcus, who was already at a disadvantage, proposed a fight without rules and whether he was really that powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those from the Apis Boxing Club within the ring erupted into fits of laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno exclaimed, "You are absolutely right. That sounds </span><span>interesting</span><span>. A fight without rules is bound to be exciting. We agree with you very much. Let's start right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the discussions and doubts of the crowd, Marcus nodded to Moreno and said, "Come on. I don't want to waste time with you. The quicker this fight is over, the better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his words, Moreno immediately rubbed his hands and rushed towards Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two men swung their fists at Marcus' temples with terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of dodging, Marcus punched one of them in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a muffled scream, the man collapsed to the floor!</span></p><div class="pagination">
