  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Ryan was Marcus's biological father. As his son, watching Ryan nearing death, even though they had rarely interacted, Marcus's feelings were quite complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, don't be sad. This day was bound to come sooner or later, I just didn't expect it to come so quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryan's voice was very weak as he looked at Marcus lovingly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "I had already chosen you as my heir before. My words still stand now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After I pass away, you will be the Godfather of this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But honestly, when I first met you, I didn't think highly of you because the gap between you and your two brothers was just too big.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't expect you to grow so quickly. Now, you are already an Acquired State Nine expert!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way, I can rest assured passing the position of Godfather to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Ryan looked at Marcus with a hint of expectation in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, I know the healing techniques. I should be able to cure your illness. Why not let me try?" Marcus suggested.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Timeless Warrior's Grimoire possesses extremely powerful healing effects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryan shook his head and said, "It's useless. I'm not sick; my lifespan has simply run out. This year marks my 5000th year in this world, yet I still haven't stepped into that State. This means I've lost my final chance to extend my life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was deeply shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected that Ryan was already 5000 years old. In other words, when the world within the Ice Wall was still in the primitive era, he had already been born.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryan said, "Are you curious about my identity? Before I die, let me explain it to you. I hope it will help you on your future path."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded. He was naturally very curious about Ryan's background.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Actually, I am not from the world within the Ice Wall. I come from Atrandis Continent, the son of the king of that land.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because of the fight for the crown prince position, I was betrayed and imprisoned on this continent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, this continent was still in its primitive stage. After I arrived here, I was despondent for a long time before pulling myself together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then, I became the most powerful man in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I know that even if I rule this world, I still don't belong here. I am the prince of Atrandis Continent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are things that belong to me there. For many years, my only goal has been to return.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But obviously, I failed. I hope you can carry on my will, return to Atrandis Continent one day, and reclaim everything that belongs to me!" Ryan continued, his tone filled with excitement and unwillingness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was deeply shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had always thought Ryan was a native of this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his surprise, Ryan also came from a world beyond the Ice Wall, and he was the prince of the legendary Atrandis Continent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, I really want to know, what state are you in now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryan took a deep breath and replied, "The peak of Innate State Nine. If I could break through that state, I could return to Atrandis Continent and reclaim everything that belongs to me. Unfortunately..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was astonished that this seemingly frail old man's cultivation had actually reached the peak of Innate State Nine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his state, he could easily defeat everyone within the world inside the Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder he&rsquo;s so powerful. Everyone in this world treats him with utmost respect!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, strength means everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet even so, Ryan still lacks the strength to return to Atrandis Continent. This alone proves how powerful the royal family of Atrandis Continent must be!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, my time is running out. Now, I will pass on all my lifelong knowledge to you. I hope you can inherit my skills and reclaim everything that belongs to me!" Ryan said slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he waved his palm. An invisible force burst forth from his hand, instantly enveloping Marcus's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, Marcus sensed a terrifying power surging from Ryan's palm, rapidly pouring into his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Marcus felt his body overflowing with energy, and the blood in his veins seemed to become extraordinarily active.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That power was clearly boosting his cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, his cultivation reached the peak of Acquired State Nine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Ryan quickly aged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus could feel Ryan's power rapidly diminishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, he will soon die!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep going!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, Ryan completely ignored his condition and kept forcefully transferring power into Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, at a certain moment, Marcus felt his cultivation rapidly break through the barrier, reaching a brand-new level, the Innate State!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Ryan's powerful infusion, Marcus's cultivation directly reached the Innate State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The transition from Acquired State to Innate State is a transformation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This State is far more powerful than Marcus's previous one. He only felt his body filled with endless strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether it was his physical body, spiritual senses, or other abilities around him, all were elevated to a brand-new level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Marcus's gaze fell on Ryan, he was startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ryan's eyes were wide open and vacant. He seemed to have aged many years compared to before. Forcing out his last bit of strength, he said, "Marcus, I have given you every last ounce of my power."</span></p><div class="pagination">
