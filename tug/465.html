  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't respond immediately. He was mentally sorting through his priorities, figuring out what he needed to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he was sure there was nothing urgent on his plate, he finally agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon was visibly delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he reflected on their online interactions, Marcus realized that the Shannon in real life was quite different from her online persona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In real life, she was active, energetic, and full of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But online, she transformed into a sweet, charming girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her speech became softer, and she even sent out adorable emojis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wasn't sure if she acted the same way when chatting with others, but the contrast was striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them agreed to meet at a high-end barbecue restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marcus arrived, he spotted Shannon at a window-side table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gone were the combat clothes she wore during their earlier interactions; instead, she was dressed in a light pink dress. Her hair, once tied back in a ponytail, now cascaded loosely over her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear she had taken some time to look her best before leaving the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her makeup highlighted her features, making her look even more refined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The transformation from the strong, tough fighter to this graceful, feminine version of Shannon was striking. The girl in front of him now was undeniably beautiful&mdash;young, vibrant, and exuding an almost ethereal charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, over here!" she called out as Marcus entered, smiling and waving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her movement was fluid, graceful&mdash;a stark contrast to the fierce warrior he'd seen earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This, Marcus realized, must be the true Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, time spent in the ring was brief; life outside the arena was where she truly lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sat down, his gaze taking in Shannon once again. Up close, she was even more stunning. Her radiant beauty and carefully composed demeanor surprised him anew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what is it? Is there something on me?" Shannon asked, a playful note in her voice as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and leaned forward, checking herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From this angle, Marcus couldn't help but notice the subtle curve of her neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the intense training earlier, she had likely worn a chest compression garment, but now, in this relaxed outfit, it was clear that her figure couldn't be hidden&mdash;her skin was a warm, sun-kissed shade that added an undeniable allure to her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, it's just that you've changed so much," Marcus smiled, clearly impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does that mean you think I looked bad before?" she teased, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, quite the opposite. I think you look beautiful&mdash;completely different from how you appeared in the ring earlier," Marcus answered, shaking his head with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have a good eye," Shannon replied, her face flushing with color, her demeanor now fully that of a young woman in her prime, exuding vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Shannon's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus noticed the name on the screen: [Ewan.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon sighed in annoyance before answering. "Didn't I tell you? I'm not coming. I'm out having dinner with a friend. Stop calling me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly ended the call, her bright smile returning as she looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everything okay?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon shook her head, "It's nothing. Just a guy who can't take a hint. Don't worry about him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus just nodded, not pressing the issue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Throughout their meal, the same name&mdash;Ewan&mdash;popped up on Shannon's phone multiple times, but each call was quickly ignored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After about an hour, their dinner came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They talked for quite a while, and it was during their conversation that Marcus learned Shannon wasn't originally from Solomia&mdash;she was actually from Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was just studying at Solomia University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had a passion for combat sports and spent her free time training at the Tiger Fist Fighting Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm really glad we could have dinner together, Mr. Fitzgerald. I hope we can do this again sometime," Shannon said as they walked to the parking lot, giving him a warm, charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marcus asked where she was headed next, she mentioned returning to Solomia University. He offered to drive her, and she accepted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They drove in his Aston Martin, a car that made quite the impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as they were getting out of the car in front of the school, a group of young men approached, surrounding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader of the group was a tall, muscular man with a striking appearance, his gaze directed at Shannon and Marcus with clear hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his eyes narrowed, his animosity toward Marcus was palpable, filled with silent, but unmistakable, hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shannon, so this is the guy you've been seeing? No wonder you turned me down," the tall youth said, his voice seething with anger, as his eyes practically burned a hole through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon stood her ground, shooting a cold, irritated look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who I go out with is none of your business, Ewan. Stop trying to control my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm your senior. I invited you to a class reunion, but instead, you turned me down to hang out with some stranger. Tell me, who is this guy? What makes him worth your time?" Ewan sneered, his voice thick with disdain as his gaze grew more venomous, especially when it landed on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon, undeterred, snapped back, "Ewan, even if you're my senior, I won't let you disrespect Mr. Fitzgerald. He's the one who defeated two top fighters today in the ring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan, a seasoned fighter himself, had been Shannon's mentor at the Tiger Fist Fighting Club. But now, she would not let anyone talk down to Marcus. Not even him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
