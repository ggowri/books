  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus explained the treatment method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila felt a sudden rush of embarrassment, her gaze flickering nervously as she couldn't bring herself to meet his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of her discomfort, Marcus continued his work, steadily channeling Timeless Numinous Energy into her injured ankle, gently coaxing the damaged tissue back into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the flow of energy deepened, Lila began to feel an unexpected, intensifying sensation that stirred something far more personal within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body reacted with a series of breathless moans that slipped from her lips, and she felt she had wet herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breaths came in shallow, quick gasps, and Lila, feeling overwhelmed by the wave of sensation, tried in vain to stifle the sounds bubbling up from within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, she pressed her hand to her mouth, desperately trying to hold back the noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sensations kept intensifying, far too powerful for her to ignore, and soon, she couldn't contain herself any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The growing intensity of the sensations finally reached a tipping point, and in that fleeting moment, Lila felt herself soaring to a height she had never known before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind went blank, her body completely surrendered to the feeling, like the years of pressure and stress she had been carrying suddenly melted away, leaving her in a state of pure release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body quivered uncontrollably, overwhelmed by the rush of feeling, as warmth spread through her, soaking her panties in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A breathy cry escaped Lila, her face flushed deep red as she surrendered completely to the sensation, her body trembling with pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never have imagined, even in her wildest dreams, that the first peak of pleasure in her life would come to her in such an unexpected way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had simply been tending to her sprained ankle, yet he had unintentionally led her to experience something far more pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a little while, Lila's ankle had completely healed, and Marcus pulled his hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense sensation that had overwhelmed her vanished the moment his hand left, and Lila felt an unexpected sense of loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at him, unable to stop herself from asking, "Mr. Fitzgerald, is the treatment over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded casually. "Try standing up and walking around a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila hesitated, still feeling that lingering emptiness, but she stood up and carefully took a few steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise, there was no pain at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what was even more amazing was that this ankle had been hurt before, from all the dancing she used to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It always ached when it rained or the weather turned gloomy, but now, that discomfort was gone too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned and couldn't help but look at Marcus with newfound awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I didn't realize your medical skills were this impressive. I really have to hand it to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked closer to him, her face glowing with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though, your method was a bit... unconventional. I'm embarrassed about how I acted earlier..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of how she had reacted, so out of character, made her cheeks burn with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a woman, and you have normal feelings. My energy stimulated a certain part of your body, so of course it triggered a reaction. If you hadn't felt anything, that would've been strange," Marcus explained in a calm, matter-of-fact tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his explanation was clinical, Lila's face turned an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, let me sing you a song," she said, glancing around and getting an idea as she noticed the beauty of the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The park was lush with greenery, the lake sparkling under the sun, and a gentle breeze making everything feel peaceful and relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I've never heard a live performance before," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila beamed and quickly grabbed a guitar from the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers strummed the strings, and the soft, melodic sound mixed perfectly with the calm atmosphere around them, creating a peaceful, soothing vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started playing and singing one of her most popular songs, the same one Marcus had always loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something about hearing it live, right there in front of him, that made the performance even more special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every gesture and every note felt so real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the song ended, a few park-goers had gathered around, drawn in by her performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone gasped, "Wait, isn't that Lila?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's actually singing here? What kind of luck is this, running into her in the park?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's her! Let's go check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the park wasn't crowded, there were now a good number of people watching from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all respectful, not crowding around but rather enjoying the moment from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a second. She's singing for someone. Who is he? Must be someone important for her to sing just for him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the onlookers spotted Marcus nearby and couldn't help but envy him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, if I ever had someone sing to me like that... my life would be made."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else nodded in agreement, watching the scene with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila sang two more songs for Marcus before packing up her guitar. Together, they left the park.</span></p><div class="pagination">
