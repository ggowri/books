  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Uswadian people have always been humble. It's not good for you to exaggerate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening to Jordon's words, Mike immediately said to Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike still kept his gentlemanly smile, but his words were mocking Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade frowned, "I saw these with my own eyes. I'm not exaggerating. That patient is still in the hospital. You could go to the hospital to check it! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike said to Jordon, "Grandpa, severe appendicitis perforation shock must be treated by surgery, which should be recognized by the global medical community. Unexpectedly, Uswad has overcome this problem. It seems that we are short-sighted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon glanced at Jade and said with a smile, "The modern medical skills of Uswad were all learned from Weston Land. Until now, many core medical technologies are still in the hands of Westoners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Many sophisticated medical instruments and surgical treatments for critically ill patients are also from Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this case, Uswad cannot surpass Weston Land in medical skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon looked up with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his words were not exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Modern Uswad was invaded by foreign powers, and some traditional cultures were seriously eroded. The culture of Weston Land had permeated Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many of Uswad's skills had been lost in modern times, including medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, modern Uswad medicine was basically improved by the medical skills of Weston Land and even followed the original Weston Land's medical methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a big gap between Uswad medicine and the medical skill of Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was why Robert wanted to send Jade to Acoton for further study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Look at Jordon's arrogant face, Jade was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She loved Uswad's culture since she was a child and had a natural rejection of Weston Land's culture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the two Westoner's triumphant faces, she couldn't wait to have Marcus here right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As far as I know, Robert invited us here because he wants to send you to Acoton for further study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you have such a brilliant person in Uswad, why do you want to go to Acoton to study? Wouldn't it be better for you to study in Uswad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike said with a smug face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade frowned with anger. Be she could speak, Robert said, "The overall medical level of Uswad is indeed different from that of Weston Land. I admit that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Mr. Fitzgerald, mentioned by Jade, is an exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I probably wouldn't believe anyone else would be able to cure a perforated appendicitis without surgery, but I won't question Mr. Fitzgerald. I saw his medical skills with my own eyes. It is no exaggeration to say that he has no opponent in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon and Mike were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike said disdainfully, "Since Mr. Cooper speaks so highly of him, I'd really like to meet Mr. Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even a professor as accomplished as my grandfather can't say there's no one better than him in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It seems that Mr. Cooper is also a person who likes to brag as much as your daughter. I didn't know until I came to Uswad that the so-called modesty of Uswadian people is ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade couldn't stand it and said, "My father never brags. Mike, you have gone too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are talking nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please invite Mr. Fitzgerald here and let him compete with me in public. If I lose, I will be convinced!" Mike sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't believe Robert and Jade at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert and Jade said there were people who could cure severe shock patients with appendicitis perforations without surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And then, they said the man's medical skills were unrivaled in the world. Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike couldn't stand it and, regardless of his identity, contradicted them directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Jordon didn't speak, he acquiesced to Mike's behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, I'll call Mr. Fitzgerald now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert's desire to win was aroused and he called Marcus directly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
