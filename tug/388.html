  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, of course!" Josie answered with firmness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Josie practiced Magic Codex, she discovered that she knew these two types of magic, and her health was much better than before, especially her energy, which was obviously more abundant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if she didn't sleep all night, she would still be energetic the next day. These changes made Josie eager to learn more powerful magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus taught Josie Firebolt and Lightning. The magic Josie had learned from "Magic Codex" was only for viewing purposes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Practicing Magic Codex was just to help Josie lay the foundation for future practice. However, Firebolt and Lightning were lethal magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, you're so good to me!" Josie kissed Marcus on the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman in love looked like a teen girl no matter how old she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie's daughter was in school, and her parents-in-law were old, who was not convenient to go out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Josie could only stay in Solomia for one day. After spending a romantic morning with Marcus, she rushed back to Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After seeing Josie off, Marcus thought of Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine had been serving as the general manager of Sync Group's branch in Solomia for a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had always been concerned about her work situation, so he called Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a coincidence, Mr. Fitzgerald. I was just about to call you." Catherine was somewhat surprised when she received the phone call from Marcus. Her voice was sweet and soft, which made Marcus feel pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you calling me about?" Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I miss you. Since we parted last time, you didn't even send me a message. I thought you disappeared," Catherine said with some complaints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine had sex with Marcus last time. Women always had a sense of insecurity. Marcus hadn't contacted her recently, which made Catherine feel that Marcus had abandoned her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled, "I've been too busy these days. I called you as soon as I had time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, there is another thing that I need your help," Catherine said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just go ahead. When did you become so shy?" Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine said, "I have a reunion with my elementary school classmates at 6 o'clock tonight. We haven't seen each other for more than ten years. They discussed it in a chat group, and they all agreed to go. I couldn't decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the premise is that everyone has to bring a partner. Mr. Fitzgerald, could you please go there with me as my boyfriend? I didn't want them to think that no one wants to marry me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a hint of expectation in Catherine's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay." Marcus agreed without hesitation. Catherine had given him the most precious thing, so he would definitely not refuse such a request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's great, Mr. Fitzgerald. I love you!" Catherine said with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus found that since they had sex last time, the way Catherine spoke to him was obviously different. She became a little sticky and intimate with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Marcus asked Catherine about her work at the branch of Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the assistance from the professionals from Kingston, Catherine didn't need to worry about many things. Those people would settle the affairs for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine could learn a lot from them, such as some management expertise. She felt that she had improved a lot in just a few days. It made her even more grateful to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At 5 p.m., Marcus drove his Aston Martin to the headquarters building of the branch of Sync Group in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Catherine walked out of the building with several female colleagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was delighted to see Catherine chatting and laughing with her colleagues. It seemed that she was living a happy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sweet-looking female employee said to Catherine, "Ms. Wilson, your boyfriend is here to pick you up. See you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine blushed, said goodbye to her colleagues, and got into Marcus' car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching the Aston Martin drive away, those female employees all looked envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said enviously, "Oh, when will my prince charming come? I wish I could have a boyfriend like Ms. Wilson's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop dreaming. We are ordinary girls. Even if such rich and handsome guys like us, most of them just want to have fun. Few of them will have feelings for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Wilson must have won her boyfriend's love with her sincerity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was unaware of what these female employees were talking about. He drove towards Kirkland Hotel, the gathering place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Somehow, Catherine thought of the romantic scene that had happened in the car that day, and her face turned flushed as soon as she got in the car.</span></p><div class="pagination">
