  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good afternoon, Uncle Kyle and Aunt Penny," Shannon greeted them sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny had always been fond of their niece. From the time she was little, they had doted on her endlessly. It was no surprise that they took Shannon's future to heart, especially when it came to marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, the couple had tried setting her up with potential suitors more than once, but their efforts always failed. Shannon turned the candidates down each time, leaving Kyle and Penny frustrated and defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A couple of days ago, at a gathering in the pharmaceutical industry circle, they ran into an old friend, Alan Keyes, whom they hadn't seen in years. During their catch-up, they learned that Alan's son had just returned from studying abroad at Acoton, where he had a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences, and he was single.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Kyle and Penny immediately thought of Shannon. They made the trip from Kingston, determined to play matchmaker for their beloved niece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their enthusiasm faltered as they saw the man standing next to Shannon. They frowned ever so slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shannon, who is this young man?" Kyle asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a radiant smile, Shannon replied, "Uncle Kyle, this is Marcus Fitzgerald, my boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room seemed to tense. Kyle and Penny's expressions shifted from pleasant to strained. They thought, "What is going on with her? We've come all this way to introduce her to someone, yet she brings another man along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instinctively, they turned to Jeremy Keyes, the young man they'd brought along. His face mirrored their unease, and the coolness in his eyes as he glanced at Marcus was hard to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shannon, since when have you had a boyfriend? Why didn't you tell us?" Penny squeezed out a smile and gestured for Shannon and Marcus to sit. "Come on, take a seat. The food will be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Kyle introduced the tall, wiry young man beside them. "Shannon, let me introduce you. This is Jeremy Keyes. He's the person we wanted you to meet today. He's a pharmaceutical industry PhD and a department head at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals in Kingston. His annual salary is tens of million dollars, and his parents are also in the medical equipment business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon gave Jeremy a smile and nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Jeremy stood up and extended his hand in greeting. Shannon didn't so much as glance at it. She sat down, leaving his hand hanging awkwardly in the air. Jeremy's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, sensing the tension, quickly stepped in to smooth things over. "Jeremy, this is my niece Shannon Jarvis, the one I mentioned earlier. She's a junior at Solomia University and passionate about martial arts. In fact, she's won the championship in an all-women's fighting competition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle continued, rattling off the details about Shannon. "Her parents are also in business, with an annual turnover of twenty to thirty million dollars. And even though she's into martial arts, she's just like any other young woman in her day-to-day life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's eyes lingered on Shannon. He couldn't seem to look away, captivated by her striking beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penny seized the opportunity to push things along. She said, "Jeremy, if you think Shannon's a good match, let's not waste time. It's rare to find two people as exceptional as you both are. You wouldn't want to miss this chance, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy was just about to nod when Shannon said, "Aunt Penny, I already have a boyfriend, so let's not discuss matchmaking anymore. Let's just enjoy this meal together. It's been half a year since I last saw you and Uncle Kyle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words caused Kyle and Penny's expressions to darken immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle leaned in, his tone firm and lecturing. "Shannon, you're 23 now, an adult. You can't be so reckless. Does your boyfriend even have your parents' approval? The world's complicated, and it's hard to judge people at your age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As someone who's been around, let me tell you, choosing a partner shapes your life. What does this young man do for a living? What's his education? What do his parents do? Can he even compare to Jeremy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle's words were blunt and cutting, but his intentions were clear. Shannon was his only niece, and he wanted nothing but the best for her. The thought of her settling for someone unworthy made his stomach churn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon's face turned cold, her voice defiant as she replied, "Uncle Kyle, I understand that finding a partner is a lifelong decision. But only I can decide what's right for me. Marcus is everything I've ever dreamed of in a boyfriend, which is why I chose him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle was frustrated at her stubbornness. He slammed against the table, his voice rising. "Shannon, you still haven't answered my question. What does this man do for a living? What's his educational background? What about his </span><span>parents</span><span>' </span><span>jobs</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marriage is about finding a good match, and I won't allow you to get involved with someone who doesn't measure up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Marcus, Kyle added pointedly, "Since Shannon won't answer, why don't you introduce yourself? Let's hear it straight from you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
