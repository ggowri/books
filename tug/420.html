  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Marcus spoke, the expressions of Darian, Aniya, and Ramona froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all turned to look at him, their gazes filled with a mix of confusion and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're a doctor?" Aniya asked, her voice tinged with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No," Marcus replied, shaking his head slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his response, Aniya couldn't help but laugh scornfully. "Even if you were a doctor, with your age, your medical skills would likely be basic at best. And now, you're telling me you can treat my Cal? Are you here just to joke around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Aniya's words were harsh, Darian couldn't deny there was some truth in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could see why she was skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona, too, spoke up at this moment, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I know you mean well, but my son Cal has a rare congenital heart condition. Even top specialists from Kingston couldn't do anything for him. What makes you think you have the answer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ramona, don't listen to him," Aniya cut in, her voice sharp. "Earlier, he was talking about how Darian could earn a million-dollar salary. I don't see him putting his money where his mouth is. He's probably just some guy with a bit of cash, acting like he's someone important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian felt the sting of his mother-in-law's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't like he hadn't heard her criticism before, but this time it was different. He quickly intervened. "Mom, enough. Mr. Fitzgerald is here with good intentions. I'll go get the nurse and let him see Cal, even if just for a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had come all this way, and despite the harsh words, Darian couldn't let him leave without at least trying to help. He wasn't going to turn him away, not like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's voice rang out again, dripping with sarcasm. "If you want to know why you've always struggled, just take a look at your worldview. You're a long way from knowing the right people. Director Rollins' son? He knows an executive at Golden Group, and just by flattering him, he got promoted to department manager. You&mdash;you're stuck with people like this, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian felt his frustration bubbling up, but he bit his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His wife Kiera and he had been a source of constant disapproval for Aniya, but he didn't need to argue with her right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, felt his eyes narrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could sense a deeper issue here. The way people used connections to get ahead&mdash;it was something he intended to address sooner rather than later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd been planning to shake up Golden Group from the inside, and this just solidified his resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sophia, my friend wants to see my son. Please, just let him in," Darian said, his tone urgent but polite, as he led Marcus toward the nurse's station where a woman named Sophia was on duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia glanced at Darian and sighed, her face unreadable. "Darian, you've been coming here for a while. You know the rules of the ICU. Unless you're a close relative, no one gets in to visit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian was undeterred. "Sophia, my friend has come from far away to see Cal. Please, he just wants to check on him. With the way Cal is, he might not have much time left. Could you just make an exception? Please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia shook her head firmly. "Darian, I'm sorry. I understand your pain, but the rules are the rules. If you want to break them, you're going to have to leave. I can't let anyone else in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a man in his forties, walked over, flanked by several medical trainees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His attention was immediately drawn to the conversation between Darian and Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on here?" Dr. Yale Crawford asked, his tone professional but curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia stood up straight, her expression shifting to one of respect. "Dr. Crawford, Darian is insisting on bringing an outsider into the ICU to see his son, Cal. I've followed hospital policy and told him no, but he's refusing to leave, so I've been trying to get him to understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yale turned his gaze to Darian, ready to give him a firm lecture about hospital protocol, but then his eyes landed on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His demeanor immediately changed. "Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, you're here again. I didn't expect to see you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mention of Marcus' name shifted the mood entirely. Yale, though a respected physician, had no hesitation in showing deference to Marcus. After all, Marcus was well-known at Solomia Hospital, having been welcomed by the hospital director on his previous visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian and Sophia were both taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hadn't expected this man, a senior doctor, to treat Marcus with such obvious respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, maintaining his calm demeanor, explained, "I came to see Cal and perhaps offer a treatment. I've been following his case closely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia's skepticism was palpable. "His condition is rare&mdash;congenital heart disease. Even the specialists in Kingston couldn't help him. Are you sure you know what you're talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before anyone could respond, Dr. Crawford's voice rang out, sharp and commanding. "Sophia, do you know who Mr. Fitzgerald is? If he says he can help, then he can. If anyone can treat Cal's heart condition, it's him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weight of his words hit Sophia like a ton of bricks. Her face went pale, her eyes wide with disbelief. She hadn't expected this.</span></p><div class="pagination">
