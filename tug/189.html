"Mr. Fitzgerald, this is Lester. What can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Troy is your son, right?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Mr. Fitzgerald, how do you know that?" Lester replied quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your son is very arrogant. He threatens to kill me," Marcus said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Lester became furious. "How dare the rebellious brat offend you? Mr. Fitzgerald, where are you? I'm going to break his legs right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Your son will call you later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he hung up without waiting for Lester's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was close to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, they could hear Marcus' conversation with Lester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, Troy, and Peter glanced at each other and smiled sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy, in particular, burst into laughter. "What a country bumpkin! Are you fucking pretending to call my father? Who do you think you are? But your acting skills are pretty good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter chuckled, "Why doesn't he take a piss to look at himself? Does a country bumpkin like him deserve to know Mr. Stevens? It's really absurd!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides them, even Melina and a dozen other girls were unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Lester was far high up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was president of the Rising Group and a well-known figure in Kingston.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Marcus, an unemployed man from Solomia, come into contact with such a big shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina reminded Natalia, "Natalia, you better leave right now, or you won't be able to run away when Troy's father shows up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia glanced at Marcus, and seeing that he was lounging back in his chair with his eyes closed and no intention of leaving, she remained silent.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you country bumpkin, I'm talking to you. Are you fucking deaf? It's fine if you mention my father's name somewhere else to put on airs, but you are actually using him to scare me. Don't you think you're ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy glared provocatively at Marcus with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Troy, don't be angry with a country bumpkin. Didn't he say he called your father? Why don't you confirm it with your father?" Peter advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe that Marcus really knew Lester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a point!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy nodded immediately, and as soon as he took out his cell phone, it rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Lester calling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy complained with a smug expression, "Dad, someone beat me up, caused trouble in Mr. Burnett's villa, and even pretended to be one of your acquaintances. Rush over and deal with him right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his opinion, as long as Lester was willing to come, Marcus would be doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as he had just finished speaking, Lester roared at the other end of the phone, "Shut up, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy frowned and asked hurriedly, "Dad, what happened? Is there something wrong? Why are you so fierce with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester was so furious that he almost fell. He warned through gritted teeth, "Shut up. Are you trying to piss me off to death? Stay there and wait for me. I'm going to teach you a lesson right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Troy could make a reply, Lester ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't feel anything wrong because Lester was usually very strict with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beating and scolding were commonplace, and this was Lester's style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Troy still did not realize the seriousness of the situation at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's wait and see. My father will be here soon, and that country bumpkin will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey and Peter grew even more arrogant, waiting for Lester to come and deal with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, the door of Harvey's villa was pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen men in suits entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader looked middle-aged, somewhat bald, and not very tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Lester, the president of the Rising Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he anxiously hurried to the courtyard of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you're finally here. Teach the country bumpkin a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy immediately became excited and pointed at Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
