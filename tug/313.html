  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had just taken a bath in the hotel room and was ready to head out to investigate matters regarding the arms port when he received a call from Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert was very happy when he saw that the phone was connected. He said excitedly, "Mr. Fitzgerald, how come you didn't let me know you were coming to Solariae? I could've sent someone to pick you up at the railway station!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus knew it was because of Jade that Robert had learned that he had come to Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He casually replied, "I'm here to take care of small things, so there's no need to bother you, Mr. Cooper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Robert came straight to the point, "Mr. Fitzgerald, there's something here that requires your expertise. Do you have the time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, unsure what Robert was up to. He asked, "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert told Marcus in detail what had just happened between him and Jordon and Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fuming with indignation, he said, "They can look down on me, but they can't insult Uswad medicine! I implore you, Mr. Fitzgerald, to shut these two Westoners up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned, only feeling somewhat uninterested, "I have something to do later, so I won't be getting involved. You'll have to figure it out yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he was only saying this because he didn't want to see Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Robert hurriedly pleaded, "Mr. Fitzgerald, if you don't come, they'll completely trash Uswad medicine. I beg you once more to step in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't expect Robert to be so persistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Robert is Charles' good friend, Marcus felt it would be inappropriate to refuse again, so he reluctantly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I, Robert, sincerely thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Marcus agree, Robert's tone became noticeably excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up the phone, he sent his driver to pick Marcus up from his hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Cooper, so what's the result? Does that Mr. Fitzgerald dare to come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Robert end the call, Mike smugly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike seemed eager for Marcus' arrival, clearly hoping to humiliate this Uswadian man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My driver is on the way to pick Mr. Fitzgerald up. He'll be back in about 15 minutes. Please be patient, Mr. Cole." Robert said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing that worried him was that his daughter had offended Marcus on the train. He wondered if it would affect the image of them in Marcus' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Excellent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike nodded and said to Jordon, "Grandpa, it looks like our trip to Uswad won't be in vain. After all, we're about to witness the so-called 'Master Healer' that no one in the world can match, haha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon, with a mocking smile on his face, said to Mike, "When that man comes later, try to show some mercy. After all, we are guests at Professor Cooper's house, and we can't make Professor Cooper too embarrassed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike nodded smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the door of Robert's house opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Led by the driver, Marcus came in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert immediately stepped forward and greeted him with a smile, "It's been a while, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert's demeanor was as respectful as could be, more so than when he greeted Jordon before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, come and greet Mr. Fitzgerald!" Robert yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade bit her lip and looked unnatural, but she came to Marcus at Robert's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Jade spoke, Marcus took the lead in saying, "We met on the train before. No need for greetings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Marcus ignored Jade and walked into the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face turned slightly sour. She wanted to lash out, but the occasion wasn't appropriate, and she had to swallow her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Robert's only daughter, she has been spoiled since childhood. She had never been treated this way before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This guy has given me the cold shoulder not once but twice now! Although his medical skills are extraordinary, his arrogance is simply unbearable!" Jade thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade secretly vowed that, given the chance, she would teach Marcus a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert invited Marcus into the living room, trying to introduce Marcus to Jordon and Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Jordon and Mike remained seated on the sofa the entire time, with no intention of getting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Professor Cooper, is this the Master Healer you were talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike sized Marcus up with an expression of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Judging from his age, he seems to be even younger than me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People at this age in Acoton will still be in college. How could he possess the kind of legendary medical skills as Robert described?" Mike felt a doubt in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, this is Mr. Fitzgerald. He is the person with the best medical skills I have ever seen in my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert nodded and elevated Marcus to the position of the most formidable doctor in his mind!</span></p><div class="pagination">
