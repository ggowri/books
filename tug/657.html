  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was none other than Silas Whitaker, the Vice General Manager of Sync Group's Solomia branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silas had been sent by Marcus from Kingston to assist Catherine with her work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was known for his sharp skills and strong work ethic, and he had quickly become one of Catherine's most trusted aides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that Silas, the Vice GM of Sync Group's Solomia branch? I didn't expect him to show up here. He must be here to see Jenson, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, he's the only one who has ever worked with Sync Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, but for him to come in person, it's pretty clear Jenson has some serious connections. That's impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. Silas is high-ranking in Sync Group. Getting him to come personally really shows how much power Jenson has!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Silas entered, several people immediately recognized him and started whispering to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, a former parts supplier for Sync Group, was no stranger to Silas. When he saw him walk in, a spark of hope lit up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitaker, what brings you here?" Jenson asked, a flicker of optimism still lingering in his voice, as if he thought there was a chance to restore his partnership with Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silas, however, barely glanced at him before turning his attention away, not even bothering to make small talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked straight to Marcus and, in front of everyone, gave him a deep bow. "Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room immediately fell silent, eyes wide in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Silas to show such deep respect to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he bowed to him was like a subordinate acknowledging a superior, completely catching everyone off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus only waved dismissively and said, "Go ahead and announce the company's decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silas nodded, his respect for Marcus evident. He then raised his hand and declared, "Sync Group is planning to invest ten billion dollars in Solomia to set up the largest sales company in the East, which will handle the distribution of our products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Maximus will be the General Manager of the new sales company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Silas turned to Chad and, with all eyes on them, said, "Mr. Maximus, if you have no objections, then from this moment on, you are the General Manager of Sync Group's East Sales Company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad was completely stunned. His mind couldn't process what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few moments ago, he had been working as a delivery driver, struggling to make ends meet, and now, out of nowhere, he was being made General Manager of a major sales company. It felt like a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, Vivian, Natalie, Sean, and the others were all standing there, frozen, completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have expected that Marcus' casual words would result in Chad getting such a high position. It was totally unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean couldn't hold back. "Mr. Whitaker, Sync Group is a publicly listed company worth trillions. Something as big as setting up a new branch can't just be decided on a whim. Doesn't it need board approval, or at least a formal appointment from the chairman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can one sentence from Marcus make this happen? Are you serious? Or is this all just a show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made the crowd pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone with experience in large companies knew that what Sean said made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creation of a new branch, especially for a company this size, would require approval from the board or a formal decision from the chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to believe that one sentence from Marcus could make it official.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian, clearly skeptical, added, "I knew something was off. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but now it's clear. Thanks to Sean for pointing it out, otherwise, we'd have all been played."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, with a forced smile, asked, "That's right. Setting up a sales company is a huge deal, and something like that requires an official appointment letter from the chairman. Mr. Whitaker, where's your letter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silas sighed, clearly tired of the questioning. He rolled his eyes and took the official appointment letter his secretary handed him, showing it to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The letter was as official as it got, detailing the establishment of the East Sales Company and appointing Chad as its General Manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had the chairman's signature and the company's official seal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That shut everyone up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, Vivian, and the others looked visibly displeased, but there was nothing they could say now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian, still skeptical, pressed on, "But this guy isn't an executive, nor is he the chairman. Why are you all listening to him like he's the one in charge? Doesn't this undermine Sync Group's authority?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silas chuckled darkly. "The chairman? Let me make this clear. Mr. Fitzgerald is someone the chairman himself respects. One word from him can determine whether the chairman stays or goes. Got it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
