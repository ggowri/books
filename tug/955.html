  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Following this logic, it made sense that Orson was being so respectful toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Orson had been promoted by Jalen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And considering Jalen's position in the Serpent's Coil, Orson wouldn't dare to show disrespect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian and Fiona exchanged a quick glance, clearly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hadn't expected Marcus to have ties to the underground world in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Maximilian wasn't too concerned about Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His company, </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies, was worth hundreds of billions of dollars and had a major influence in Kingston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Marcus had connections with someone high up in the Serpent's Coil, it wouldn't affect him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' gaze shifted slowly to Maximilian and </span><span>Fiona,</span><span> his tone indifferent. "Now, it's your turn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian and Fiona's eyebrows rose in disbelief. Maximilian sneered, "I'll admit, I underestimated you. I didn't realize you had connections with </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> underworld.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But don't think for a second that just because you know people down there, you can threaten me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies. No matter how powerful the Serpent's Coil is, their reach doesn't extend to Kingston, right?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, even if we're talking pure power, </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies is just as strong as the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, in the end, you can't do anything to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian spoke with a smug, almost mocking grin, clearly reveling in his superiority.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd couldn't help but agree with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, no matter how influential the Serpent's Coil was, they couldn't just reach into Kingston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Marcus was probably just some distant relative of a high-ranking Serpent's Coil member.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Serpent's Coil might knock some sense into someone like Alistair, but they'd never get involved in a conflict with </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies just because of Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before the crowd could settle into this line of thinking, Marcus spoke again, and the room fell silent, "You really think I can't touch you? Let me tell you something: One phone call, and you'll be out of a job as vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was taken aback, stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took them a moment to process what he'd just said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was claiming that he could get Maximilian fired with just one phone call?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was he out of his mind?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he was somehow related to a bigwig in the Serpent's Coil, there was no way he had that kind of power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd started to think that maybe Marcus was getting a little too cocky after Orson's support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was just a small-time karaoke bar owner in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, worth only tens of millions of dollars, and he wasn't even worth comparing to someone like Maximilian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian was the executive vice president of a huge company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of both status and financial power, Maximilian far outclassed Alistair in every possible way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no way Marcus had the power to take him down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Maximilian and Fiona couldn't help but laugh at Marcus, their smiles dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona spoke up, her voice dripping with disdain, "You think just because you've got connections with shady people, you can touch my husband? Dream on. Just because Orson is treating you with respect doesn't mean you can act like a big shot. It's obvious you've never seen real power. You'll always be that frog in the well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian laughed as well, shaking his head, "Lad, I really don't know what to say. I wasn't planning to get involved today, but now you're just embarrassing yourself. Here you are, puffing yourself up like you're some big deal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So go ahead, show us. Show me how you're going to get me fired with one phone call."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was now watching with curious interest, waiting to see if Marcus could pull this off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Kiera shot him a skeptical glance, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Marcus had ties to the Golden Group and was the real leader of the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the idea that he could order Maximilian's dismissal from </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies seemed far-fetched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't answer Maximilian, pulling out his phone instead and dialing a number with ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He casually gave instructions on the phone to remove Maximilian from his position and hung up the phone just as casually.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire call lasted less than two minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To the onlookers, it seemed like Marcus was just putting on a show.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian and Fiona exchanged </span><span>looks,</span><span> their expressions now full of ridicule.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona let out a mocking laugh. "I have to ask&mdash;who exactly are you calling? Don't tell me you're just faking it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian grinned. "You hit the nail on the head. He's probably just pretending.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the entire </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies, the only person with the authority to fire me is the CEO.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at him&mdash;does he look like he knows the CEO?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others in the room couldn't help but laugh, their expressions full of scorn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' phone call did seem more like a performance, which made them doubt its legitimacy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lad, you've made your call, but I'm still the executive VP of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies. You said you could fire me, but I'm still standing here, aren't I? Go ahead, </span><span>hahaha</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian sneered, clearly unimpressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at him, unphased, and said, "In one minute, you'll get a call telling you you're fired."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian raised an eyebrow and let out a derisive chuckle. "Alright, I'll wait. What's a minute, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no sooner had he spoken than the phone began to ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's expression shifted as he saw the CEO's name flashing on the screen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He inhaled deeply and answered, his tone instantly polite. "Sir, the negotiations went smoothly. Is there something I can do for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm calling to let you know you're fired. You no longer work for </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll pay you an extra six months of salary as severance. Once you're back in Kingston, head to HR to settle your final paycheck. After that, you'll have no further ties with the company."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's eyes widened in disbelief. He had to be hearing things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that? I don't think I caught it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I said, you're fired. You're done here. Go to HR, get your pay, and then you'll have no further association with </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The CEO's words were blunt, leaving no room for negotiation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's face drained of color.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His heart raced as he stammered, "Sir, I've been loyal to </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies for years! Why would you just fire me like this? I don't think I've done anything to deserve this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You didn't offend me, but you crossed someone you shouldn't have. Don't bother pleading&mdash;it's pointless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The CEO's tone was cold and unfeeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who? Who did I cross? Can you please just explain?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's suspicions were rising fast, but he couldn't help himself&mdash;he had to know, even if the truth would shatter him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really don't get it, do you? You're asking me who? The person you crossed is right in front of you. Now stop asking me questions. I'm telling you, if Mr. Fitzgerald holds me responsible, I might not even be CEO anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the CEO hung up, leaving no room for further conversation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
