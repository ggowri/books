  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine could hear the contempt and disdain in Cody's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately frowned and said to Cody, "If you don't let my boyfriend come along, I'm not going either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let me tell you something! My boyfriend isn't inferior to anyone, so what's this nonsense about lowering Special Advisor's standards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a warmth spread through his heart at Maxine's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden had given Maxine direct orders to meet with the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Maxine had resorted to begging Cody showed how crucial this assignment was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet when Cody refused to let Marcus join them, Maxine didn't hesitate to back out, standing firmly by Marcus' side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, when Cody took subtle jabs at Marcus, Maxine jumped to his defense without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It demonstrated how much Marcus meant to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody's brow furrowed as he asked Maxine, "You're seriously giving up the chance to meet the Special Advisor because of him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This opportunity doesn't come around often! You better think this through carefully. How do you plan to explain this to Mr. Wilde?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I just can't wrap my head around this. What makes this guy so unique that you'd throw everything away for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Cody finished speaking, several people in military uniforms behind him cast puzzled looks at Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were equally unable to comprehend her current behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my business, and you don't need to worry about it," Maxine said firmly. "I'll find a way to explain everything to Mr. Wilde myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine turned to Marcus and said, "Marcus, if they don't show us respect, we might as well leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Maxine unexpectedly took Marcus' hand in hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth noting that this was the first time she had ever initiated holding Marcus' hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt entirely surprised by this unexpected gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!" a voice commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus and Maxine could take their leave, Cody's ice-cold voice rang out from behind them once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine furrowed her brows and turned around, asking, "Is there something else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody's eyes were fixed intently on Maxine's hand holding Marcus', and with growing coldness in his heart, he couldn't help but say, "You mentioned earlier that he defeated </span><span>Eldoria's</span><span> cyborg, so he must be pretty strong. I want to test his skills myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody's declaration caught the attention of the uniformed soldiers beside him, their faces lighting up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Cody had claimed the top spot in combat training at </span><span>Acoton</span><span> Military Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't just physically imposing; he had been trained in lethal combat techniques since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This expertise was crucial in earning him </span><span>Acoton's</span><span> highest honors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their surprise, Cody openly challenged this young man before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truthfully, none of them had believed Maxine when she claimed Marcus had defeated the </span><span>Eldorian</span><span> cyborg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had only kept quiet about their doubts to save her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody was throwing the gauntlet at this young man right before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus would accept the challenge if he possessed the skills Maxine had bragged about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he backed down, it would prove Maxine had been lying all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine frowned at Cody and said, "We've got business to take care of, so we'll have to pass on your little sparring invitation. Sorry about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Maxine grabbed Marcus' hand and started heading toward her police car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could leave, Cody's massive frame blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at six-foot-five with muscles rippling under his clothes, he cut an intimidating figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus was a respectable six feet tall, he seemed almost diminutive next to Cody's dominating presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not going anywhere unless you beat me first!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
