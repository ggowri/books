  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frigid voice rang out from not too far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Bloodthirsty Cult looked in that direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He witnessed a glimmer of light shining. The light expanded and swiftly coalesced into a figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shape of a young man appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader froze and inquired, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who</span><span>ever</span><span> could appear silently within the main hall of the Bloodthirsty Cult must be extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The man who's going to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus spoke, he took rapid strides forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying light converged in the palm of his hand, and he immediately launched a Fist Ray towards the Bloodthirsty Cult leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader's eyes were cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated that Marcus would attack him so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Southvaia, no one dared to be so audacious towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unprepared, he was caught off guard. He hastily launched a counter-attack to defend himself but was jolted back continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, why are you so arrogant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he sneered. He was pretty sure he could kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scoffed, "You're too weak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took another step forward and released the Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader also entered a fighting state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A red light radiated all over his body, and terrifying witchcraft was unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly launched two destructive attacks on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attacks of a Curse Weaver were powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if two ferocious beasts, filled with tox, were charging madly towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could make a move, the two beasts spat out the green liquid. The liquid emitted heatwaves and was highly corrosive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who touched the liquid would break out in ulcers all over their body, regardless of their cultivation level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the first person who has dared to attack my cult alone. You'll become my food today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, the Bloodthirsty Cult leader looked at Marcus with the will to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already sensed that Marcus' cultivation had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was surprised, he had confidence in his own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader could tell that Marcus had only recently advanced to this realm, while he had been dormant in this realm for many years. His strength was greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, ignoring the attacks of the two beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directly retrieved the golden scimitar from his Spatial Ring and slashed it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blade Ray contained power of Rune with patterns lingering above it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it collided with the two ferocious beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumbling sounds resounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack of the beasts was chopped to pieces by the Blade Ray and shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the power of the Blade Ray remained undiminished. And it directly severed the heads of the two beasts. Green blood spurted out, giving off a foul stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader was shocked. He hadn't expected that Marcus was not only proficient in swordsmanship but also integrated the power of Rune into the Blade Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, our strengths are on par. If we continue to fight, both sides will suffer. What's your connection with the three guardians of mine who went to the Celestial Arc Order?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing the power of Marcus' attack, he no longer wished to engage in a fight with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was still confident that he could win the battle, he was wary of losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm dating Ada," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Bloodthirsty Cult burst into laughter. "You're strong enough to date all kinds of girls. Why would you fight me over one woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want women, I have an abundance of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the leader of Bloodthirsty Cult clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, hundreds of women in sexy bikinis emerged from the rear of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were perfect in appearance and figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And each had her own unique charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These women were from Oriana Land, Weston Land, and many more from Southvaia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was dizzying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus had seen many women, he couldn't help but be momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can take all these women with you. Each of them has been meticulously selected, and they're all virgins. You can pick any woman you desire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Bloodthirsty Cult said and tried to tempt Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "If I kill you, all these women will belong to me anyway!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
