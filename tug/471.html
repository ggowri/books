  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Marcus had already arrived at the Solomia Hospital's rehabilitation ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rehabilitation ward was located in a separate building from the main outpatient block. This building was not part of the usual route Marcus took through the hospital, and it was his first time visiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon entering the ward, Marcus found Kiera in good spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her condition had improved enough to ease his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she was still not well enough to be discharged, as the shock she had suffered earlier was quite severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus left some fresh fruit and supplements in her room, chatted with her for a while to lift her spirits, and then made his way out of the rehabilitation wing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he passed by the surgery department, however, he was drawn in by the rising noise coming from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The patient's injuries are critical. The situation is urgent. Only Freya has the experience to perform this surgery properly, Jade, stop pushing your way into it. You're no match for Freya," a voice shouted from behind the doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Director, whether it's according to the schedule or the patient's admission order, this surgery should be mine. Why are you constantly undermining me? Is it because of the past between you and my father?" Jade's voice cracked with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, I don't know what you're talking about. What happened between me and your father was years ago&mdash;don't make baseless accusations," came the cold reply from the director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm assigning Freya to this surgery purely because she trained at Halvard Medical School, and you did not. It's that simple. This is hospital policy. If you have a problem, go talk to the dean!" the director continued, his voice firm and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, curious, peered around the corner and saw three figures standing outside the operating room&mdash;one was a tall, middle-aged male doctor, and the other two were young women in their twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his surprise, one of the young women was none other than Jade, the daughter of Robert, the chief surgeon at Solariae First Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had crossed paths with her once before on a high-speed train to Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, Jade and her friends had mistaken him for a voyeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, at a dinner at Robert's home, Marcus had an altercation with Myker, a professor from Halvard Medical School.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The result was disastrous, leading to the deaths of Myker and his grandson at Marcus' hands&mdash;events that indirectly caused Jade to lose her opportunity to study at Halvard Medical School.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had only been a month since then, yet here she was, working in the surgery department at Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, haven't you heard the director?" A young woman with a confident smile, Freya, said to her. "This surgery is still mine. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face flushed with embarrassment and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite her experience as an associate chief surgeon at Solariae First Hospital, where she had assisted with hundreds of surgeries, she had yet to perform a single operation since transferring to Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This wasn't just about her professional pride; it was also impacting her income and could lead to her being sidelined in the department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that Freya&mdash;who had recently trained overseas&mdash;was being favored by the director, Jayden Clark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden had once worked at the same hospital as Jade's father, Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two had always seen each other as rivals. Robert, with his exceptional skills and performance, was eventually promoted to the position of department head&mdash;a move that had been a break from the usual protocol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden, unable to accept this, caused a scene at the hospital, protesting the decision. The fallout was severe, and Jayden was ultimately fired from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From that point on, a deep rift had formed between Jayden and Robert, one that had only grown over time. Their professional rivalry had turned personal, leaving a bitter history that now played out in their careers and in the department where Jayden now held power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A month ago, both Jayden and Jade had been transferred to Solomia Hospital's surgery department, with Jayden appointed as the director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade, however, had been placed in a subordinate role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden held onto his grudge and had been making life difficult for Jade ever since, undermining her at every turn, keeping her out of the operating room with every excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Freya, you've already handled several major surgeries. This one should be mine, especially since I was the one who initially admitted this patient and I know his condition better!" Jade's voice was tense, filled with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough!" Jayden's sharp command interrupted her. "Didn't you hear me? Freya is an overseas-trained doctor. Only she has the qualifications to perform this critical surgery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to Jade, his tone colder than ever. "I'm ordering you to hand over all the patient's details to Freya. If you want to be in the operating room, you can assist her, but that's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face darkened with indignation, but there was little she could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the face of Jayden's authority, she had no choice but to comply. "Fine," she muttered bitterly. She reluctantly explained the details of the patient's condition to Freya.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The patient had been involved in a severe car accident and had suffered crushing fractures to both legs. Without immediate surgery, it was likely that both legs would have to be amputated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Jade spoke, Marcus, who had been quietly listening, gathered the key points of the case. He wasn't familiar with the patient personally, but it seemed like an urgent matter. The severity of the fractures meant the surgery had to be done as soon as possible to save the legs, but it was unclear whether the patient would ever be able to walk again afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jayden, I studied this type of injury during my time in Acoton," Freya said, her voice calm but confident as she addressed her superior. "The fractures can be stabilized, but the primary goal of the surgery will be to save the legs, not to restore full mobility. In other words, this is more of a cosmetic procedure&mdash;just to preserve appearances."</span></p><div class="pagination">
