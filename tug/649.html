  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad's face turned pale with panic. He never imagined the woman would actually bring backup to track them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Chad a reassuring pat on the shoulder and ignored the woman's gloating remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused back on Jacob, his tone sharp. "So, you're just a manager in the transport department, but you can call on the company's security like that? You've got a lot of pull, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob smirked. "Of course. I've got connections in this company. Getting the security team on my side is a piece of cake. A word from me, and no one dares cross me here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds like you've been making a pretty penny off those connections, huh? All these years of doing well for yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued to probe, trying to get a better understanding of what was going on within Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jacob could respond, his woman spoke up, a smug grin plastered on her face. "You country bumpkin, listen to me. My husband's loaded. He's got hundreds of millions in the bank, money you'll never see in your lifetime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob shot her a sharp look, his eyes narrowing in anger. "Didn't I tell you to keep a low profile? What's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing her mistake, the woman immediately shut up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can stop trying to dig for info. It won't work. With my connections at Bayside Petroleum Company, even if you know my business, you won't be able to bring me down. Got it?" Jacob sneered, his arrogance returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Security,</span> break their legs! Let them pay for insulting my woman!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Jacob's command, the Bayside Petroleu<span>m Company security guards started to move in on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" A voice rang out, stopping them in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one of the guards who had been with Joan when they tried to confront Marcus earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, he had witnessed Marcus' power firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bob from Serpent's Coil had shown Marcus nothing but respect, even going so far as to clash with Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Joan had been severely injured by Marcus, Jacob had no chance of standing up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason the guard spoke up wasn't out of concern for Jacob but because he didn't want to get involved in this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he knew that both the Jenkins couple were dead at Marcus' hands, his fear would've only grown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter?" Jacob furrowed his brow, looking at the guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard hesitated but finally said, "Mr. Perry, this man knows people in Serpent's Coil. You'd better not mess with him, or you'll end up in deep trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob froze for a moment, then sneered. "So what if he knows people in Serpent's Coil? I know them too. Today, I'll see how much power this guy really has!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob quickly ordered his men to continue the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards didn't believe the warning and immediately lunged at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, this is all my fault. You should go. I'll handle this!" Chad, sensing the danger, didn't want to drag Marcus into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus shot him a reassuring look and dove straight into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, it was like a tiger in a flock of sheep. Marcus unleashed a flurry of punches, effortlessly knocking down anyone who tried to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each punch, another guard fell to the ground, writhing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than a minute later, every single one of them was on the floor, incapacitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left Jacob and his wife completely stunned. They never imagined that Marcus was so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the guard who had warned Jacob earlier couldn't help but gasp in shock. Now he understood why Serpent's Coil treated Marcus with such reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guard knew the underground world valued strength above all else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Marcus had earned the respect of Serpent's Coil through sheer power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your turn now." Marcus cut through the silence, locking eyes with Jacob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob's face drained of color, his body slick with sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately tried to threaten Marcus. "Kid, I advise you not to mess with me. I'm the project manager at Bayside Petroleum Company. If you hurt me, Bayside Petroleum Company will make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even acknowledge him. With a single swift kick, Jacob was sent crashing to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob gritted his teeth in pain, his forehead drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, terrified, tried to threaten Marcus. "How dare you lay a hand on Jacob? I'll call the cops on you right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish her sentence, Marcus slapped her across the face, sending her flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a slow, deliberate step toward Jacob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob's mind raced, but before he could say anything, Marcus stomped down, shattering his limbs one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob howled in agony, unable to believe that the man he'd been so arrogant toward was now the one bringing him to his knees.</span></p><div class="pagination">
