  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad told me my sister graduated from a university at Solariae and landed a good job. She's bringing her boyfriend home today," Jane told Marcus. "And my brother got into one of Ganston's top high schools. He'll be graduating next year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke about her half-siblings, there was no resentment in her eyes&mdash;only a hint of contentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your father's unemployed and in poor health. I'm guessing you've been paying for their education?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pretty much." Jane nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though her father had spent all the money she sent home on her half-siblings, she harbored no bitterness about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her only lingering resentment was how her stepmother used to beat her, and her father not only failed to stop it but took her stepmother's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This trauma had haunted her since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even now, at thirty years old, she would sometimes wake up from nightmares about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five hours later, their car entered Tremont, the capital of Ganston state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's dad lived in a suburban area over 60 miles away from Tremont.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With nightfall approaching, they checked into a hotel in Tremont for the night, planning to head to Jane's place in Sunnyvale early the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Sunnyvale was technically part of Tremont, its remote mountain location meant it was quite isolated with poor transportation links.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took Marcus an hour and a half to get there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus pulled up to Sunnyvale village in his BMW 5 Series, he immediately caught the attention of several older women gossiping near the village entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a fancy car! When did anyone in our village get such a beautiful car? I sure haven't heard about it," one of them remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That car looks expensive. Must be worth at least a hundred thousand dollars," one of them said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're right. My son told me it's called a BMW. It's a luxury car worth even more than that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nobody in our village could afford a car like that. It must be Simon's daughter. She's back for her father's 70th birthday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh yes, now I remember. Jane, wasn't it? Her father married her off to someone in Solomia when she was just sixteen. Haven't seen her in years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard she married some rich businessman. No wonder she can afford such an expensive car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane and Marcus were oblivious to the gossiping women. Following Jane's directions, they pulled into a driveway where an elegant new mansion stood in stark contrast to its aging garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, Lucas, I think Jane's back. Let's go check!" In the mansion, a lovely young woman in her twenties, bearing a slight resemblance to Jane, called out to the elderly man and young man beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young woman was Tracy Dowson, Jane's half-sister. The elderly man was Jane's father, Simon Dowson, and the young man was her brother Lucas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing Tracy's words, both Simon and Lucas immediately rose and headed for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing next to Tracy was a tall, handsome young man wearing gold-rimmed glasses. This was Tristan Harrold, Tracy's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had met while Tracy was studying at Solariae. His parents were from Kingston, and he reportedly came from a wealthy family - his father was an executive at a publicly traded company there. Tristan had returned to Sunnyvale with Tracy for Simon's 70th birthday celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tracy, did you see Jane drive back in a BMW? She must be doing well for herself, but she hasn't sent Dad any money for the past year. Wonder what's going on with that," Lucas whispered to Tracy as they watched the brand-new BMW 5 Series parked in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy's eyes flickered with displeasure. "You're right. She can afford luxury cars for herself but won't spare any money for the family. Dad really wasted his time raising her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Though I heard her husband's family business went under. Maybe she's not as well off as she appears."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need a lot of money for my business right now. Dad asked Jane for it, but she claimed she had none. Yet, here she is, driving a luxury car. I'm so pissed! I'm going to have Dad tell her to sell that car and give me the money for my business," Lucas said with bitter resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spoke as if Jane was obligated to give him money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, be quiet. They get out of their car. We don't want them to hear this," Tracy warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Marcus and Jane stepped out of their vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy, Lucas, Simon, and Tristan all froze for a moment, their attention immediately drawn to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to contain her emotions at seeing her family again, Jane stepped forward and took her father's hand. "Dad, I'm home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at his daughter, whom he hadn't seen for years, Simon didn't seem as emotional as one might expect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just responded mildly, "Must have been a long drive, coming all that way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, about five hours on the road." Jane nodded, exchanging brief greetings with her father and siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jane, who's this? Aren't you going to introduce us?" Tracy asked, looking at Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
