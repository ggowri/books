  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left Chad completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in school, Marcus was always the quiet one, often pushed around and bullied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Chad who stepped in and took care of things for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just a few years later, not only had Marcus become powerful, he was now ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing it firsthand, Chad couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll regret this. You hear me? I won't let you off!" Jacob growled at Marcus, his voice full of venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His limbs were destroyed, and he'd likely spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. Revenge was the only thing on his mind now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus barely spared him a glance, turning to Chad instead. "This place is a drag. Let's head home. Don't forget the reunion tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad nodded absently, still in shock, and followed Marcus out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they left, Jacob's woman couldn't hide her anger. "Honey, what are we going to do about him? We can't just let that guy go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob's tone was filled with fury. "I'll call the company. There's no way they'll just sit back and let me get treated like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured for the woman to hand him his phone, but before he could dial, it rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the general manager of Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob answered, but before he could speak, a cold voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jacob, you've made a huge mistake. You're fired. Don't bother showing up tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob's body went stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, who had the phone on speaker, froze as well, her face draining of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, what's going on? I haven't done anything wrong! Why am I being fired? Please, tell me what happened!" Jacob begged, his voice desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The general manager's tone was sharp. "The person you messed with today... that's Mr. Death, the one who just acquired Bayside Petroleum Company yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, do you know the reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit Jacob and his woman like a thunderclap. They were both paralyzed in shock, their minds racing but unable to process it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob thought in disbelief, "How could that be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man is Mr. Death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Am I imagin</span><span>ing</span><span> things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could that happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was consumed with regret. Why had she ever thought it was a good idea to mess with someone like Marcus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob's limbs were gone, his career in ruins, and his future uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus had no idea what was happening with Jacob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew one thing. Anyone who crossed him wouldn't have a happy ending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob had been nothing more than a parasite at Bayside Petroleum Company, and Marcus was more than ready to clean house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at his villa, Marcus threw himself into his training, zoning out into the flow of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the afternoon of the next day, around 4:00 PM, that he emerged from his deep focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick shower, Marcus hopped into his Aston Martin and drove to Chad's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Chad's parents were both battling terminal illnesses and all his savings had been siphoned away by his ex-wife, he had to sell their only house to pay for his parents' treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was living in a run-down apartment in a poor neighborhood with terrible living conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus arrived, Chad was just getting back from delivering food. He'd been out working again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready. I heard Jenson might bring your ex-wife here. When you see her, keep your cool," Marcus advised him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd gotten the tip from Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier that day, out of the blue, she had flooded him with messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, not really interested, replied briefly, though it seemed she had a lot to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't pay much attention, just offering a few short responses, but from their exchange, he learned that Chad's ex-wife would be coming over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad visibly stiffened but quickly regained his composure. "Don't worry. She's a stranger to me now. I won't let her get under my skin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they were ready, it was already 5:30 PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drove Chad to the parking lot of Golden Hotel. This was one of Golden Group's properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had been here a few months ago when he'd just become the heir to the Godfather. It was here that he first took down Abigail and Felix, securing his position as the chairman of Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of nostalgia filled his chest as he remembered the past.</span></p><div class="pagination">
