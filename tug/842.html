  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's interest in this young man was aroused by Marcus' way too outrageous statement, and he said with substantial mockery, "I'm sorry. Can you repeat what you just said? I didn't follow you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua enjoyed a good reputation in the pharmaceutical raw material industry after years of hard work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his reputation led to cooperation with Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture, which benefited both of them, so Joshua snorted at Marcus' brag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, his determination to humiliate this smug young man was also enhanced. He had to make Josie see how unreliable the man she insisted on entrusting herself to was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Joshua's scornful words, Marcus repeated what he said with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Joshua immediately burst into laughter right after he finished speaking and said to people around with a bigger sneer, "Everybody heard that, right? He said he could make Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture cancel our cooperation. As the person in interest, I have to ask this young man to prove to us all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned his head to Marcus and continued, "This is the first time I have ever met such a bragger. In that case, if you can't do that, break up with Josie right here, right now. How about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied with an indifferent smile and said, "What if I can?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua said without hesitation, "I'll kneel and lick your boots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the great sarcasm in his words was Joshua's assurance that Marcus would never be able to cash his threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, after he finished speaking, many old classmates of his present immediately cast sarcastic glances at Marcus with a gloating smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal. I hope you can stick to your words," Marcus continued with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding within a second after Marcus finished speaking, Joshua said, "So do you. Don't forget to give my Josie back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he said that, his eyes couldn't help but be attracted to Josie's sexy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greed flashed through his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his crush on her, Joshua had fantasized about their sex countless times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus was committed to their bet, it would be the perfect chance to get laid with her. Joshua made up his mind to seize this opportunity and ease his deep lust for this sexy woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Joshua's momentary lustful gaze at Josie, Marcus frowned imperceptibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he left the box to dial a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side of the phone, Yvonne grumbled in a soft voice, "I was just wondering when you were about to call me, Marcus. Did you forget me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, of course not. Hey, is there a person named Joshua Sanders, one of the suppliers of the Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture?" Marcus came straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne rolled her eyes. As expected, this man would never call her unless it was for business or something that needed her help. She said, "Hang on a minute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she started searching for that man and confirmed there was indeed a supplier named Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, he was not the sole supplier, and the supply amount and annual output value didn't match the level that he boasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Yvonne's information, the quantity of raw material that Joshua supplied merely reached the top ten suppliers', which meant that even if Golden Group immediately canceled its cooperation with him, it would bring no damage to the business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this knowledge, Marcus breathed a sigh of relief and said to Yvonne, "Okay. Cancel the contract with this man right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir," said Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, she almost had forgotten there was such a supplier if Marcus hadn't called her for him today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It also manifested that the so-called alpha male Joshua claimed to be was quite suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his annual profit, he might be considered a successful man. But it was only about 50 to 60 million dollars, which was a huge gap from the titanic number Joshua claimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Marcus returned to the box and attracted everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer, Joshua asked, "You have finished your phone call. What about it? Did Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture follow your order and cancel their cooperation with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could sense a hint of sarcasm in his seemingly calm voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't joke around, Joshua. You didn't take his words seriously, did you? Honestly, I have seen through his lies. For Josie's sake, I didn't expose his lies, but my tolerance drove him more and more insane. If we don't stop him now, he might brag about making this country his garden!" Hannah said with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus became more and more unreliable under her estimation, Hannah didn't even bother faking her friendliness and began to directly mock him in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scrutinizing Marcus with scornful eyes, Molly said, "I can't understand what is in a liar's mind. You have finished your phone call, so tell us what the Golden Group's response is. When will they cancel the cooperation with Joshua as you said?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua smiled with the victory and said, "According to our bet, break up with Josie now and hand her to me. Don't go back on your word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His statement won a lot of approval as they all heard what Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he lost, and he should step out of his relationship with Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus replied with a sneer, "Be patient. Your phone should ring within a minute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned for a moment, Joshua was about to scold him when his phone suddenly vibrated violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking out his phone with impatience, he almost shouted at the person on the other side of the phone, "Who is it? I'm at a classmate reunion. Call me later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to roughly hang up the phone and tug it into his pocket, a deep voice came from the telephone receiver. "Are you Joshua?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, and tell me what you want right now. If there's nothing serious, I gotta go!" said Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he became a supplier of Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture, he had been pestered by many unwanted calls from bootlickers, cooperation seekers, or simply some scammers, which Joshua loathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the executive vice president of Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture." However, just as Joshua finished speaking, he heard such things from his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that it was a call from his distinguished business partner, Joshua immediately switched the scorn in his voice to great humility to the extent of flattery. "May I ask what you called me for? The last batch of raw material was just delivered in time. Do you want additional quantity?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
