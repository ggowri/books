  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul proudly showed his phone to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His earlier doubts had vanished now that he'd found the reason, and his arrogance grew even more unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Melinda, looks like your Marcus hasn't learned anything useful in all these years with the Winchester family except how to play dirty tricks. What a failure in parenting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise laughed mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica and Christine joined in, their taunts flowing freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel shot Marcus a harsh glare, unable to accept this adopted grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a Lexus LX570 pulled into the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan hurried out of the car and rushed into the room, looking flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitby, is the riverside project finished? What brings you here?" Paul asked with surprise, refusing to believe Jonathan's arrival had anything to do with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to Nicole as he addressed Jonathan with a fawning smile. "Mr. Whitby, this is my young cousin I told you about. She's only eighteen and would make a perfect match for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan looked at Nicole appraisingly. "Indeed, quite promising. We can finalize the arrangements this evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A calculating smile spread across Jonathan's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This girl's a real looker, way hotter than that plain Jane he's got at home," Jonathan thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't mind throwing some extra cash her way for a night," he mused before catching himself and remembering his actual purpose there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, Paul, you sly dog! You should've told me you had a VIP staying with you. I would've come paying my respects much sooner!" Jonathan declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left Paul, Jessica, and the others completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole family was there. "What VIP was he talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitby, I'm afraid I don't follow. Which VIP are you referring to?" Paul asked, thoroughly confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping sweat from his brow, Jonathan explained, "Headquarters sent me here to meet someone called Mr. Fitzgerald. They specifically told me to treat him with the utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The river project isn't even finished, but I rushed over here, afraid of getting in trouble with HQ. Come on, Paul, where's Mr. Fitzgerald? I need you to introduce me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan's words hit them like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald? Could he mean Marcus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus is just a freeloader. The Winchester family kicked him out not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would Solomia's top construction company give him so much respect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be...that Marcus has been secretly making a fortune somewhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face darkened, his eyes filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm quite satisfied with your construction company's efficiency. If there are future projects, you'll definitely be my first choice for collaboration."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone was still processing their shock, Marcus's voice cut through the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan turned to look at Marcus, instinctively sizing him up. "Are you Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could answer, Louise jumped in with a sneer. "Mr. Whitby, he's just my nephew, a gold digger who married into the Winchester family. He was recently kicked out and now makes ends meet as a chauffeur. There's no way he's the Mr. Fitzgerald you're talking about. The headquarters must have made a mistake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise's words seemed to click with everyone else as they all nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her statement made Jonathan doubt himself, too. He quickly stepped aside to double-check with headquarters over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A minute later, he returned to the table, and his gaze toward Marcus had transformed into one of respect.</span></p><div class="pagination">
