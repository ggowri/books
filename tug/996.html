  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yasser..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie wanted to tell Yasser what she had experienced at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't speak out, she would always feel guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if she did, their relationship would surely come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was struggling in great pain. For a moment, she didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie, just say what you want to say. Don't hold it in. I know you're still mad at me. I promise that I'll never treat you like that again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser continued, his eyes very sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing. I don't hold it against you anymore. Let's let it slide, okay?" Gertie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, Yasser noticed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus was just in his early twenties, which was very different from the image of a powerful senior he had imagined, Yasser couldn't help but ask Gertie, "Gertie, who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Yasser's question, Gertie couldn't help feeling nervous. She forced a smile and replied, "This is Marcus Fitzgerald. He's a friend of my cousin and also my friend..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie didn't know how else to introduce Marcus, so she could only refer to him as a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser raised his eyebrow upon hearing that. He didn't know when Gertie and Ada had made such a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yasser. Ms. Leah made a breakthrough in her cultivation. She really did! This is incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Devon, who was standing beside them, exclaimed, his voice filled with excitement and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that Gertie's cultivation had been stuck at Ancient Martial Stage Nine for many years, and she had never found a way to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she tried a lot of precious pills and different methods, she still couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser had been in seclusion with Gertie half a month ago, trying to help her make a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't help her make it happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, she had only left him for half a month, and she had already made progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Yasser couldn't help but release his spiritual senses to scan Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately found that the aura on her was indeed different. Her cultivation had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was simply incredible. Her breakthrough wasn't anything like a small step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a direct leap from the Ancient Martial Stage Nine to the peak of the Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It included a minor completion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible unless she encountered a great opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie, congratulations. You broke through the cultivation bottleneck that has troubled you for years and reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine. Now, you can strive for the Return Essence stage. This is something worth celebrating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser said to Gertie with an excited expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly happy for Gertie at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was his fianc&eacute;e. Once her cultivation reached the Return Essence stage, it would bring great benefits to him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Yasser and Devon said made Gertie's expression even more awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps only she knew what had really led to her breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't been forcefully taken advantage of by Marcus, how could she have had the opportunity to break through?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of the scene of Marcus "working" on her, Gertie's pretty face blushed again, and her heart started to race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, her sense of guilt toward Yasser became even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yasser... I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Gertie was stammering, Yasser waved his hand at her and said, "Gertie, you don't have to say anything. I know what happened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's heart sank unexpectedly at Yasser's words. She thought he had found out something.</span></p><div class="pagination">
