  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian threw a sarcastic look at Chad, who was now clenching his fists, his teeth grinding as he braced himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, all he could do was wait and hope for a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the five minutes were up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson stood up, hands casually stuffed in his pockets, and grinned at Marcus. "Well, five minutes have passed. I'm still the same guy, the one with billions. Now, apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room burst into laughter, all eyes now on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean, sensing an opportunity to stir the pot, shouted, "Hurry up, Marcus! Don't keep us waiting. You promised, so now it's time to make good on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the laughter settled, Jenson's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment before glancing at the unknown number. Without thinking, he hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the phone rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slightly annoyed, Jenson answered. "Why do you keep calling? Who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low voice on the other end replied, "Is this Jenson? I'm from Sync Group's business department."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's attitude shifted instantly. His tone became respectful. "Yes, this is Jenson. What's this about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was firm. "I'm calling to officially notify you that Sync Group is terminating all cooperation with you, effective immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's smile faltered. "What? I've been working with Sync Group for three years! Are you sure? Why the sudden termination?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no mistake. This decision came straight from the general manager. I'm just here to inform you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's face tightened, and after a brief pause, he hung up and immediately dialed a high-ranking executive at Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bradford, what's going on? Why would Sync Group cancel our deal? You have to help me out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wyatt Bradford, one of the vice presidents in Sync Group, had always been friendly with Jenson because of kickbacks they'd exchanged over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hearing Jenson's voice, Wyatt was cold and unrecognizable. "You messed with the wrong people. Don't even think about dragging me into this. If you involve me, I'll make sure your life's a living nightmare. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jenson could say another word, Wyatt hung up, cutting him off without an ounce of sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's face went pale as he dropped the phone onto the table. His expression was one of disbelief and utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, what's wrong? Why do you look so shaken?" Vivian asked, her voice laced with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson took a deep breath, trying to mask his panic. "It's nothing... Sync Group just canceled our partnership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian's face drained of color. "What do we do now? What's going to happen to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This deal with Sync Group had been the foundation of Jenson's rise to wealth. Without it, his empire was about to crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as everyone processed the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them started to wonder if this sudden cancellation had anything to do with Marcus, but most quickly dismissed the thought, thinking it was all just a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson forced a smile, trying to reassure his wife. "Don't worry. Even without Sync Group, we're still fine. I have five billion in payments for this batch of goods and the deposit I paid them. That's enough for us to live comfortably for the rest of our lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian nodded, her expression easing slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, five billion was more money than most people could ever dream of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You can</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t get that five billion</span><span>," came Marcus' voice, cutting through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's smile immediately faltered. "What are you talking about? That five billion is mine! How could I not get it? If you don't stop spouting nonsense, I swear I'll rip your tongue off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to lose his temper, his phone rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He answered without thinking, only to hear another unfamiliar voice on the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this Jenson? This is the Kingston Police Department. We've received a report stating that the goods you supplied to Sync Group were substandard and falsified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's already been confirmed. Sync Group filed a formal complaint. You have three days to turn yourself in at the local police station. Cooperate, and you might get a lighter sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And, as a result of your fraudulent goods, Sync Group is seizing all the payments and deposits, five billion in total."</span></p><div class="pagination">
