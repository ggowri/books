  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the businesses in this district, including Alistair's karaoke bar, were under Orson's protection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Orson and the Serpent's Coil backing him up, it was clear that Marcus didn't stand a chance, no matter how skilled he was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I seem to recall that the Serpent's Coil is one of your operations, correct?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera asked, her voice steady but loud enough for those around to overhear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last time they were near </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital, Marcus had clashed with Thaddeus Rollins, which had attracted the attention of the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's when Kiera realized how much influence Marcus had with the gang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah," Marcus said simply, giving a small nod.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though they spoke quietly, their words still reached the ears of everyone nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several people exchanged glances, and soon enough, smirks crept onto their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some of them even burst out laughing, clearly mocking Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you hear that? They're saying the Serpent's Coil is under this guy's control. That's got to be a joke, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Serpent's Coil is the most powerful gang in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. Who does this guy think he is? Claiming to own them? That's just laughable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, what a joke. It's like he's trying to win the award for the most ridiculous thing ever said."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And that woman&mdash;she seems so prim and proper, but I guess she's got a big mouth after all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian, Fiona, and Alistair couldn't help but snicker at the absurdity, their smiles growing more sarcastic by the second.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian spoke up, "What on earth are you two going on about?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Serpent's Coil is part of your business? You really need to take a good look at yourself before spouting nonsense like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When the Serpent's Coil shows up, you're going to regret that big talk."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona smirked. "Both that slut and this kid are way out of their league. No need to waste time on them. Once the Serpent's Coil arrives, we can let them handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian gave a small nod of agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair let out a cold laugh. "I've never seen anyone so eager to joke about the Serpent's Coil. You really don't understand what happens when you cross them, do you?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait. When they show up, we'll see how you and your little friend play it off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ignored their mocking comments, not even bothering to engage with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a fleet of luxury cars appeared in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leading the pack was a Lexus LM500, the kind of vehicle that turned heads.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious the people inside were far from ordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The luxury cars pulled up to where Marcus and the others were standing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The side door slid open, and Orson stepped out, flanked by several of his men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his sunglasses on and a cigar dangling from his mouth, Orson gave off the unmistakable vibe of a hardened gang boss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hayes, you made it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair immediately stepped forward, his voice dripping with insincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though he ran a high-end karaoke business, Alistair knew exactly where he stood in front of someone like Orson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, Alistair was nothing more than a small player.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if he wanted to keep his business afloat, Alistair knew he had no choice but to stay in good with people like Orson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, where's the guy who caused all the trouble? I don't have all day, so let's wrap this up quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson's voice was firm as he scanned the group with a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He controlled a whole area, with two busy streets filled with shops, and every day was filled with new issues.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't have time to waste on Alistair's problems.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair nodded quickly, pointing in Marcus' direction. "Mr. Hayes, it's him. He started a scene right outside my karaoke bar and took down over ten of my security guards.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And to make matters worse, he's been running his mouth about how the Serpent's Coil is under his control. He's tarnishing the reputation of the whole gang. You have to deal with him, Mr. Hayes."</span></p><div class="pagination">
