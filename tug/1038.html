  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles chuckled, eyes filled with nothing but scorn as he turned to Evander. "Mr. Bishop, I know you can't stand me. Hell, you'd probably love to take my spot at Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But come on, this is pathetic. Trying to spook me with some random nobody? You gotta try harder than that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander's expression darkened, his voice carrying an unmistakable edge. "Miles, you want to insult me? Fine. But if you keep running your mouth about Mr. Fitzgerald, you're going to regret it. He's not someone you can afford to piss off. And when that happens, no one, not a damn person here will be able to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles let out a loud scoff, shaking his head like Evander had just told the dumbest joke in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evander, do you think I'm an idiot?" He threw his hands up. "You think pulling some random out of the gutter is gonna intimidate me? News flash, buddy&mdash;when Mr. Death gets here, I'll make damn sure you're the first one out the door!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena folded her arms, pressing up her chest as if putting herself on display. Her face showed a smug little grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Donovan's right. Mr. Death will be here any minute now. And once he shows up, there's no way he'll let some washed-up VP like you stay in the company. You'll be gone before you can beg for mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander arched a brow, watching them with something dangerously close to amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with deliberate calm, he said, "Oh, right. My bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should've mentioned this earlier... Mr. Fitzgerald is Mr. Death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words detonated in the banquet hall like a bomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps filled the room. Conversations died mid-sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could believe their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander had just claimed that this man&mdash;this young, unassuming guy&mdash;was the infamous, untouchable Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, it felt like the entire room was holding its breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Chloe, standing beside Marcus, felt her heart lurch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour ago, Marcus had told her something similar, but she had laughed it off. Thought he was messing with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now... could it actually be true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles and Selena, meanwhile, stood rooted in place, their faces frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Miles barked out a laugh, shaking his head. "Oh, come on, Evander. Are you seriously trying to sell me this bullshit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're telling me he's Mr. Death?!" He jabbed a finger toward Marcus. "Jesus, you're really pulling out all the stops to try and screw me over, huh? Dragging some loser off the street and dressing him up as Mr. Death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you take me for, a goddamn preschooler? That guy? That guy is supposed to be the legendary Mr. Death? Give me a break!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell you what, Evander&mdash;when the real Mr. Death gets here, I'll personally make sure he tosses your ass out onto the curb. Let's see who's laughing then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena snorted, tossing a sideways glance at Marcus before looking back at Miles. "Mr. Donovan, this is just embarrassing. Mr. Bishop's really out here throwing the dumbest Hail Mary I've ever seen. Does he think we were all born yesterday?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, come on&mdash;who actually believes this crap?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And truth be told, the rest of the crowd wasn't buying it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how powerful the legend of Death was, Marcus just didn't fit the image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in their right mind would believe that a guy in his twenties was the same person who had dominated the business world from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack! The sound of flesh meeting flesh cracked through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall, broad-shouldered brute man stepped from behind Evander and toward Selena. In an instant, her head snapped to the side, her cheek blossoming red from the sheer force of the slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stumbled, nearly losing her balance as a trickle of blood dripped from her lips. A couple of her teeth had been knocked loose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked absolutely wrecked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had hit her lowered his hand, expression unreadable. He was one of Royal Entertainment's elite bodyguards. One of only eight men in the company with that title. Each of them had once been top-tier mercenaries, trained killers. The only people allowed to command them were the highest executives in the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-You&mdash;" she sputtered. "You hit me?! You son of a&mdash;" Selena clutched her face, eyes burning with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack! Another slap. This time to the other side of her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a sharp scream as more blood splattered from her mouth, a few more teeth clinking onto the floor. The sight was downright gruesome.</span></p><div class="pagination">
