  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly's phone buzzed just as she finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively pulled it out of her bag. The caller ID read "Jace".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly answered it. "Hey, babe. I'm out with some friends at a party. I'll be home soon. What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me who the hell you've been pissing off out there! Why did Sync Group and Eastcomm Group just call off their deals with me? Tell me now, or I swear I'll break your legs!" Jace's voice was a storm, filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly's tone was gentle, but Jace wasn't having any of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly couldn't believe her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace was usually very nice to her and had never lost his temper with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he scolded her so harshly that Molly even thought that Jace was drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you drunk? Why are you talking to me like this?" she asked, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm not drunk. I was in a meeting when Sync and Eastcomm called one after the other, saying they had to cancel our deals because you pissed off some big shot. You never stay home and mind your own business. Now look at what you've done. My business is going to tank. If I can't make money, neither can you idle about!" Jace's voice trembled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly's head spun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Marcus, who was standing a few feet away, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eastcomm Group and Sync Group had actually canceled their deals with Jace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Jace, it was because she had offended someone important. But who could it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly had been busy all day getting ready for the party&mdash;waking up early to get dolled up and heading straight to Fortune Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't met anyone important!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only person she'd really interacted with was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Could it be that the call he made just now was serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know anything about this big shot they mentioned?" she asked Jace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not, or I wouldn't be asking you. All I know is that they called him Mr. Fitzgerald," Jace replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Mr. Fitzgerald? No way. This can't be happening. Is it really Marcus? How is this possible? Who the hell is he? He's just a young guy with a pretty face. He couldn't have that kind of power, could he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known, she would never have dared to be so rude to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart was now filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Molly, what's going on?" Hannah asked, sensing something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly's face paled. "Sync Group and Eastcomm Group have called off their deals with my husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent. Hannah, Joshua, and everyone else present looked at Marcus with a mix of shock and horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe he had that kind of influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could process what had happened, Hannah's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her husband, Adrian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She answered, already dreading the conversation. "Honey, did you get fired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, you already knew about it, didn't you? You must be trying to screw me over. How dare you have McHale Pharmaceuticals Group fire me? Did you sleep with someone else? Is that why you did this?" Adrian's voice roared through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's body shook uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe Marcus had not only canceled the deals with Jace but also got Adrian fired from McHale Pharmaceuticals Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus fired her husband with just one phone call!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? How can you have so much power?" Hannah asked Marcus, her voice trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just sneered, "I'm just me. Who else would I be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone in the room lost their composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had underestimated and ridiculed the young man who now held their futures in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a few phone calls, Marcus had dismantled the careers of Joshua, Hannah, and Molly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had actually thought he was a complete nobody with no redeeming qualities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally realized how foolish they had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people who had once laughed at Marcus now stood in fear, their faces pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were terrified that Marcus would turn on them next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his power, he could ruin their careers with no difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the gravity of the situation, everyone in the room was too afraid to speak. Their faces grew increasingly pale and anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's and Molly's faces were ashen. They knew their husbands' businesses were in ruins, and their days of living the high life were over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah and Molly were overwhelmed with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned to Josie, begging, "We're so sorry, Josie. We were wrong to look down on your boyfriend and humiliate him. Please, talk to him. Tell him to reverse his decision. We'll never mess with him again. Please, for the sake of our friendship, help us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah and Molly had lost their earlier arrogance. They bowed deeply to Josie in front of everyone, as humble as they could possibly be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie just glanced at Hannah and Molly coldly and said, "I warned you before, but you didn't listen. You turned a deaf ear to me and even mocked me. How can you have the face to beg me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's and Molly's faces turned bright red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Josie said, she had indeed tried to persuade them earnestly before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But back then, they were blinded by their arrogance and didn't realize that Marcus was someone important. Instead, they humiliated him in every way possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they just felt foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, please don't be so heartless. We only did it because we thought we were looking out for you. Give us another chance. We'll be good. We'll support you and Marcus," Hannah pleaded, still hoping for a miracle.</span></p><div class="pagination">
