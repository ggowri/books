  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't being vulgar, it's called being realistic!" Maxine said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "By the way, when does the operation begin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In three days. You can start preparing in advance." Maxine replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, then quietly reached out and took her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's body trembled slightly, her face flustered as she quickly pulled her hand away. "We've got other things to handle at the academy. I'll be going now. See you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Then you must give me a goodbye kiss, or else we'll just spend the night here together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine gritted her teeth in frustration. She knew Marcus was the kind of man who could follow through on that threat, so she reluctantly leaned in and gave him a quick peck on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, Marcus seemed to behave himself, refraining from pushing things further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine drove off, while Marcus prepared to head back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night passed quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, news of Shaun and Aiton's disappearance spread across Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement was like a bombshell, shaking both Kingston and Solomia to their cores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun was the eldest son and heir of the Whitman family in Kingston, his status invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiton, on the other hand, was the patriarch of the Hudson family in Eldoria, a globally renowned cyborg engineer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men had vanished in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, there was speculation about the cause of their disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One rumor suggested that Aiton had come to Uswad seeking revenge for his son Pete's mysterious death in a hospital&mdash;an event that indirectly led to Aiton's own disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that Aiton had brought his latest research with him, a fourth-generation cyborg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet despite these advanced technologies, it hadn't been enough to prevent his disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meaning of their vanishing was clear to everyone: whether Shaun or Aiton, both were likely doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the perpetrator was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That same day, both the Whitman family in Kingston and the Hudson family in Eldoria held press conferences, where they made a major announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They jointly offered a reward of one trillion Uswad coins for information leading to the capture of the murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear both families were pulling out all the stops in their search for the killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, couldn't care less about the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing the power of high-tech energy crystal weapons, Marcus had spent the night rifling through Elder Dupont's Spatial Ring, retrieving the energy crystals and showing them to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was equally shocked by the level of energy contained in these crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although small, the crystals were powerful enough to modify five or six firearms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weapons would be just as capable as the one Marcus used to destroy the cyborg, perhaps even more deadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 9:00 AM the following morning, Marcus had just finished breakfast when his phone rang. It was Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been over a month since they last met, and Marcus realized he'd missed her more than he expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled when he saw her name on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long time no see," he answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long time no see, Marcus. Do you have any plans today? I'd love to grab a bite with you. I've been thinking about you," Catherine's voice was as sweet and inviting as ever, her tone effortlessly warm and impossible to turn down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paused for a moment. "It's a workday. Aren't you busy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, the Cedars Villas project is completely sold out, so I'm kind of between jobs. I've got some free time these days, just looking for a new one. After we have lunch, I was planning to visit a few big companies around here to see what's available. Marcus, maybe you could help me out," Catherine said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' mind raced. The Cedars Villas project had been ongoing for six or seven years, and the last time he helped Richard and his wife purchase property there, it was almost sold out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense that it was now finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come by Golden Group. I'll set you up with a position," he offered casually, knowing it would be no trouble to arrange something for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're trying to help, Marcus, but I'd rather try on my own first. I want to prove my worth," Catherine laughed, her voice full of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, not wanting to press further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He admired Catherine's independent spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was that kind of self-reliance that made her even more appealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They agreed to meet at 11:30 AM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine mentioned wanting steak, so Marcus reserved a table at a high-end steakhouse, ordering several exquisite dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Catherine arrived, she had a completely different vibe from her usual sweet, girl-next-door persona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she wore a form-fitting dress that perfectly showcased her curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't noticed before how her slender frame was contrasted by a surprisingly full figure, especially in the chest area&mdash;certainly not smaller than Natalia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dress accentuated her long, toned legs, and with a pair of light-colored heels, she was utterly stunning. Marcus found himself momentarily taken aback by her transformation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
