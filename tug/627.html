  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert's words aroused everyone's anticipation of the arrival of the store staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus soon called Elena, who had served him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she answered his call, her tone immediately became respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a high-spending customer who bought jewelry worth 650 million dollars from their store. No matter what request he made, she would try her best to satisfy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus briefly explained his need for a store representative to come and examine the items. Without hesitation, Elena consented and promised that she'd reach the hotel within five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after getting her affirmative answer did he hang up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will the store staff come?" Albert asked sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In five minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reclined on his seat, his legs casually crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, is the Tears of the Angel real?" Jade in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that she doubted him. Instead, she was afraid that Albert and the others would take this opportunity to make a big deal out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attention, everyone! He claims that the jewelry store staff will arrive within five minutes. So, let's wait for them, and the truth will be out in the open!" Albert shouted, evidently aiming to stir up trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it was proven Marcus' Tears of the Angel to be fake, he would have a reason to deride Marcus harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is in his mind? Isn't he just asking for humiliation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect that he just held up his phone to fool us without even making the call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several classmates gathered together, engaged in hushed conversations, their eyes fixed on Marcus with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, less than 5 minutes later, there was a knock on the door again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door was pushed open, and several people in uniform work clothes entered, with Elena walking in the front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Marcus, she immediately showed a charming smile and greeted him very respectfully. "Hello, Mr. Fitzgerald. We meet again so soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene stunned everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It came as a complete surprise to everyone that Elena would greet Marcus upon her arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they know each other?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded at Elena with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at everyone and said, "Let me introduce myself. I'm Elena Gomez, working as a salesperson at Luminaire Luxe, a high-end jewelry custom store. I have been invited by Mr. Fitzgerald to come here to authenticate the Tears of the Angel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she looked at Marcus again and added, "Mr. Fitzgerald, please take out the Tears of the Angel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed her the box containing the Tears of the Angel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert and several other female classmates all grinned sarcastically, eagerly anticipating Marcus making a spectacle of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elena had the Tears of the Angel in her hands, she and several colleagues unconsciously showed their work IDs to confirm their identities and then rapidly got down to the verification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was completed in less than five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert sneered, "Ms. Gomez, the Tears of the Angel must be fake, right? I knew that the guy couldn't afford the genuine one, so he used a high-quality imitation to fool us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other female classmates laughed. However, Elena replied, "Excuse me, sir, after our verification, Mr. Fitzgerald's Tears of the Angel is genuine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her statement stunned everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, Albert, who had been showing an arrogant and sarcastic countenance a second ago, now had a dark face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked in disbelief, "How could it be? How on earth is this possible, Ms. Gomez? Are you mistaken? How could his Tears of the Angel be genuine? I just went to your store an hour ago, and the staff told me that in the morning, a mysterious big shot just bought all the jewelry in the store, including the Tears of the Angel. So how did he get the Tears of the Angel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides him, every single person present had the same question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elena smiled, "You are right. This morning, someone forked over 650 million dollars to buy all the jewelry in the store, but that individual was Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, everyone present was taken aback again, feeling that they had misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been engaged in a discussion about the identity of the big shot who had purchased every single piece of jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It never crossed their minds that the big shot was always right in front of them, but they just didn't realize it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even questioned and taunted Marcus incessantly.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, they were actually clowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert completely froze in shock, staring at Marcus with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly spend 650 million dollars on all the jewelry in the store?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he really that rich?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert found it difficult to accept the reality, as it was a terrible blow to him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
