  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over there, a tall, brawny man clad in combat attire was launching a fierce and aggressive attack against a woman who appeared to be around 28 or 29 years of age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already battered and bruised, and when faced with his onslaught, she could merely attempt to fend him off, completely lacking the strength to mount a counter-attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the strength of the Iron Fist Club? There isn't even a single formidable expert. I am so disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was Moreno Cohen, the second-most powerful person in the Apis Boxing Club, surpassed only by the club owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he had previously claimed the provincial heavyweight championship in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was known for his flexibility, remarkable resistance to impacts, and excellent offensive explosiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno had engaged in 30 fights throughout his career, boasting a record of 29 wins, all by knockout, and a single draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His impressive performance had caught the eye of top fighting clubs in both Solariae and Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno's previous acceptance speeches suggested that his ambitions had expanded beyond the boundaries of the domestic area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now set his sights on becoming a world-class athlete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And today, led by the owner of the Apis Boxing Club, Moreno came to challenge the Iron Fist Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was quite straightforward. Lately, the Apis Boxing Club had been in the midst of expanding its operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate for a gimmick to attract attention, it came up with the idea of issuing challenges to different fighting clubs in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Iron Fist Club was the tenth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that the challenger was Moreno, the other nine clubs all but conceded defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Apis Boxing Club met with the most intense resistance from the Iron Fist Club since the inception of their plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given its extremely glorious history of producing many national-level fighters, the Iron Fist Club had also become a prime target of the Apis Boxing Club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to issuing a challenge to the Iron Fist Club, the Apis Boxing Club had extended invitations to several major local media outlets and well-known bloggers in Solomia to enhance publicity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They intended to use the defeat of the Iron Fist Club as the biggest magnet to draw the attention of the national fighting industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Ewan had been incapacitated by Marcus and had exited the Iron Fist Club, the club had great difficulty in finding someone who could be a suitable match for Moreno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in the ring at that moment was Ophelia Perkins, the club owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was quite surprised that the owner of the Iron Fist Club, a club with a remarkable history spanning several decades, was actually a young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a member of the Iron Fist Club below the ring growled, "Moreno, as a heavyweight male fighter, you're a heavyweight male fighter taking on Ms. Perkins, a woman. Even if you come out on top, it is an unfair victory. Yet, you still have the nerve to provoke us. How disappointing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno sneered, "The Iron Fist Club was unable to find an opponent who was a worthy match, and you would rather die than admit defeat. It was this woman who wanted to fight me. You can't blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he threw another punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Fist Ray was so powerful that it landed in front of Ophelia in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a strong player who had won the top three in the national boxing competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the disparity in physical strength between men and women couldn't be overcome merely through skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia could only raise her hand to block Moreno's terrifying Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resounding thud, the intense force compelled Ophelia to retreat in quick succession. She slammed forcefully against the guardrail of the ring and then rebounded back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno sneered, "Hey, you have plump breasts. What if I accidentally punch them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he gazed at Ophelia's breasts unscrupulously and lustfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pervert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and launched a kick towards Moreno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even bother to dodge. Instead, he just relied on his sturdy body to endure her kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was compelled to step back, and Moreno held her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His harassment caused her to struggle desperately. "Bastard, let go of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, it's good that you are unwilling to give up. This way, I can hug you for a while longer," Moreno whispered into Ophelia's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, he actually lifted her high up and then suddenly threw her down to the bottom of the ring!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present screamed in shock. The difference in strength between Moreno and Ophelia was extremely significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't withstand his blows at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was actually hurled off the ring by him in such a manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Moreno showed no mercy. He pushed Ophelia to a height of five or six yards. Plummeting to the floor would definitely result in serious injuries to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people gasped, never expecting that he would be so cruel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was panicky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before hitting the floor, she felt a big hand lifting her up, cushioning most of the impact force.</span></p><div class="pagination">
