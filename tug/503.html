  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pitiful Uswadian people, die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja's eyes were filled with madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This grab, which appeared ordinary, contained his most powerful ninja technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a simple move, but it was infused with mental power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even so, Marcus didn't show any intention of dodging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply allowed the ninja's massive hand to close around his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only deepened the cold smile on the ninja's face, as he thought Marcus had given up any hope of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment the ninja's hand touched Marcus' throat, an overwhelming Devouring Power erupted from Marcus' body, instantly enveloping the ninja.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja tried to tighten his grip but felt his energy rapidly draining away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of dread flooded his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled, trying to break free, but he couldn't move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body seemed to be locked in place by an invisible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy poured out of him, causing his body to tremble violently and his complexion to turn pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? How is this possible? How </span><span>can</span><span> you absorb my energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with disbelief, and a voice of despair escaped his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how he struggled, it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' Devouring Power was too terrifying. In less than two minutes, the ninja stopped fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes grew dull, losing all their original sharpness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin withered rapidly, shrinking like that of a dried corpse. Eventually, he became nothing more than a mummified body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually tossed the corpse to the ground, then collected the Spatial Rings from all the ninjas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ninja truly made excellent nourishment. With the energy from his body, my cultivation should break through soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the dried corpse on the floor. A mocking smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he allowed the ninja to grip his throat was that he had been waiting for just this moment to trap the ninja and then use his Devouring Power to absorb the energy within him, boosting his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that was done, Marcus ignited a flame in the palm of his hand, quickly covering the bodies of the ninjas and reducing them to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handling everything, he strode back into Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the battle had been earth-shattering, Marcus had deliberately isolated the area's sound beforehand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the cover of the night, the already quiet Bayside Villa remained unnoticed by anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as he entered the villa, a figure materialized in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This figure was indeterminate, neither revealing a clear shape nor distinguishing gender. Even their face was hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person seemed to be surrounded by a thick mist floating in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was staring at the few corpses reduced to ashes on the ground, the figure's voice echoed softly. "I didn't expect that the humans in the cage could control such extraordinary power. Quite interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the figure vanished into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew it had been there, nor could anyone identify who it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Marcus been present, he would have been astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure referred to them as "humans in the cage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The "cage" implied confinement and imprisonment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This world, after all, was meant to be free and open, but that person referred to it as a cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words were deeply thought-provoking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They made people feel that the world they lived in might be merely a cage built by someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to his room, Marcus wasted no time and began to cultivate the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully refined and absorbed the energy he had just devoured, channeling it into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two hours, the energy from the ninja was completely assimilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation skyrocketed, pushing him to the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just one step away from advancing to Ancient Martial Stage Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This level of cultivation was something Marcus had never dared to imagine when he first began training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had achieved it in less than three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a rapid pace of advancement was unheard of in the entire world of Ancient Martial Arts in Uswad. From ancient times to the present, no one has ever matched it. He was a true anomaly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breaking through, Marcus' overall strength surged even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His combat ability was now much stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spent the remaining time practicing the Shadow Step, the Heavenly Circle Diagram, and other techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, he continued to focus on improving his magical abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After days of continuous training, Marcus felt that his Wizard level was on the verge of breaking through to Stage Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he reached Stage Five, his power would undergo another leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Pearl had prepared his toiletries. After washing up, Marcus walked out of his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Jane were already seated at the dining table, where a rich breakfast had been laid out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a long time since Marcus had enjoyed such a peaceful breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them chatted and laughed for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus received a WhatsApp message from Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message read: [Mr. Fitzgerald, my grandfather is critically ill. Can you come to Kingston?]</span></p><div class="pagination">
