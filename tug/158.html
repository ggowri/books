  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but widen his eyes. "Holy moly... What's gotten into Diana?" In his impression, Diana had always been a high and mighty, capable career woman. The scene before him completely overturned his understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alluring sight unexpectedly stirred Marcus' desires that had just been released. He quickly pretended not to have seen anything and tried to retreat to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana actually sensed his presence and hastily tidied up her clothes before asking him, "Mr. Fitzgerald... what are you looking at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus awkwardly chuckled, "Oh, uh... Nothing. I just came to the living room to get some water..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face turned crimson as she said, "I know you saw everything, Mr. Fitzgerald. Do you think I'm a promiscuous woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly shook his head. "No, of course not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my fault for not closing the door properly. What I wanted to say is... when you do those things in the future, could you be a bit quieter, Mr. Fitzgerald?" Diana bit her lip. She felt that since Marcus had already discovered her secret, she might as well speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' expression froze, a hint of exasperation crossing his face as he quickly understood what Diana was implying. "Uh... I'll be more careful in the future." After a pause, he continued asking, "Are you saying that you're like this because you heard what we were doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana saw him being so straightforward, her pretty face turned even redder. "It's more or less like that... I don't know why, but when I hear that kind of voice, my body uncontrollably heats up... I have this strong desire to do embarrassing things. Mr. Fitzgerald, please don't laugh at me." At this moment, her voice was as soft as a mosquito, no longer the image of a career woman but completely that of a blossoming young girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Diana... you should find a boyfriend." He naturally understood what Diana was saying. No matter how strong her abilities were, she was just a girl in her twenties who had normal physiological needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana heard him, a hint of disappointment appeared on her pretty face. "I'm not looking for a boyfriend. My boyfriend has to be as excellent as you, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she found the courage and directly threw herself into Marcus' arms. Her smooth and delicate hand brushed across his handsome face as she looked up and affectionately said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, ever since Mr. Gellar assigned me to be by your side, my fate has been tied to yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From that moment on, I knew that I could never belong to any other man in this lifetime, only to you, Mr. Fitzgerald. It's just that back then, we weren't familiar with each other, and I didn't want you to force me into crossing any boundaries. But as I got to know you, I gradually realized that my heart has been completely occupied by you. There's no room for anyone else anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heartfelt words moved Marcus inexplicably. He didn't know what he had done to deserve meeting someone as wonderful as Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana tiptoed and went in for a kiss. In that moment of their lips touching, Marcus could feel the intense emotions coming from her, as if her whole body was </span><span>electrified. He couldn't contain his inner desire any longer and passionately embraced Diana, engaging in a heated kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blushed and fully indulged in Marcus' passion, pouring out all the love she had hidden in her heart. While they kissed, his restless hand wandered and directly reached for her perky peaks, firmly kneading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' actions intensified, Diana's body immediately responded, allowing him to do as he pleased. "</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as the two were getting carried away in their passion, Jane unexpectedly walked out of the room. "Ahem..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane... it's not what you think..." Diana instantly snapped out of her desire and ran back to the room, her face red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane approached Marcus with a suggestive smile. "Honey... I have to admit, I didn't realize just how good you are at charming women. Ms. Harrison, of all people, fell for you&mdash;amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a glare, Marcus growled, "You little minx, always messing things up for me..." With that, he smacked her perky backside and returned to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was the day of the international martial </span><span>arts</span><span> invitational tournament. Early in the morning, Marcus received a WhatsApp message from Maxine, reminding him not to forget to come and watch her fight. He had already promised Maxine, so he naturally wouldn't go back on his word. After having breakfast, he drove to the Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
