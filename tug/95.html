  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh Mom, Christine, let's not talk about this anymore," Jessica said with fake sympathy, barely hiding her sense of superiority. "Marcus is grown up now. He can make his own choices. Maybe he actually enjoys being a driver. It's not our place to judge, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but let out a laugh, her smile dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel jumped in. "What a waste. Does he plan to be a chauffeur his whole life? Just look at Paul! Now there's someone who made something of himself. If you ask me, Melinda never should have adopted him. The boy's got zero ambition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda's heart ached as she listened to her own family tear her son apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally unable to take it anymore, she burst out, "Actually, Marcus is doing very well for himself. He doesn't need your job offers. He's even bought us a house in Solomia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words stopped Louise and the others dead in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged knowing looks with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melinda!" Christine probed carefully. "Don't tell lies just to save face. We're sisters! You can be honest with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Louise and I just want what's best for you. Stop pretending! We all know you can't afford property in Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise chimed in with a smirk. "Melinda's always been proud, even though she's never had much to show for it. But come on, you shouldn't lie to your own family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda's face darkened as she defended herself, "I'm not lying! Marcus didn't just buy us a house. It's a villa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Louise burst into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Melinda, you're hilarious! A villa? I didn't know you were such a daydreamer these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know how much a villa costs? That tiny farm of yours couldn't pay for one in a hundred years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole couldn't take it anymore and cut in. "My mom's not lying! My brother really did buy us a villa. It's the best one in the neighborhood. It cost eighty million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nicole, aren't you a bit young to be telling such tall tales? Eighty million for a villa? Who do you think you're fooling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, everyone, I'm getting married to Jessica tomorrow. Let's not argue over trivial matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's understandable that Aunt Melinda's family wants to save face, given their... situation. Let's cut them some slack and get back to eating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul waved his hand dismissively, trying to appear reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then proceeded to stuff his face, quickly filling his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lingered on Nicole, a greedy glint flashing across them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, I might have a solution for Aunt Melinda's family to improve their circumstances!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica shot Paul a warning look, clearly reluctant to have her husband help Melinda's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul whispered something in Jessica's ear, and her expression changed to an amused smile, no longer objecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this solution, Paul? Do tell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine asked, unable to hide her jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our boss has been married for years without any kids. He's looking to keep a young mistress who can give him a son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nicole's quite a catch! I figured I'd introduce her to the boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he likes her, you're looking at around a million bucks a year in allowance!" Paul declared, puffing out his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A million dollars a year was no small change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Christine felt a pang of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Nicole, her son's regular nine-to-five with basic benefits seemed pretty lackluster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, Nicole is still in college. Don't ever bring this up again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda's usually pleasant demeanor turned ice-cold at Paul's predatory interest in Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're being foolish. I'm telling you, this is a golden opportunity. I'm thinking of your family's best interests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with a college degree, Nicole will only make forty or fifty grand a month? How long would it take her to earn her first million that way?" Paul laughed smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected my daughter to make big money. As long as she's happy, that's all that matters," Melinda replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel slammed his cane down in frustration, disappointed beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a golden opportunity, and you turned it down! You're throwing away Paul's goodwill for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Samuel's words could settle, Marcus's sharp rebuke cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, wondering what Marcus was about to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mom already said Nicole needs to focus on school. What's the point of going on and on about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus's gaze landed on Paul, and he sneered, "Hey, since you're so excited about someone being a sugar baby, why don't you volunteer your own wife?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
