  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no. That's not what I meant. I just feel awkward about taking so much money from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie took a deep breath and continued, "To be honest, I was pleased that you transferred 20 billion dollars to me. It wasn't about the sum of money, but the love for me that the gesture represented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't want your money. I'm eager to demonstrate that I'm with you not for financial reasons but because I genuinely have deep feelings for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Natalie pulled out her cell phone and intended to transfer the 20 billion dollars back to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped her and said, "You don't have to regard the 20-billion-dollar transfer as a gift anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie asked in surprise, "Then as what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Regard it as the startup capital for your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's beautiful eyes became bright, and she asked, "How do you know I've always planned to start a business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "It is my guess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Natalie could get a word in, he waved his hand and said, "I'm just joking. To be honest, I think it's rather meaningless for you to keep on being the manager of that </span><span>jewelry store, so I want you to venture into your own business within this industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been working here for a long time and have amassed a wealth of work experience. I'm confident that you'll be successful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus' words, Natalie became animated and exclaimed, "I worked my way up bit by bit to become the store manager of this store. My work experience</span><span>s</span><span> and capabilities are not in question. But doesn't 20 billion dollars seem like an excessive amount?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head and explained, "No. I was pondering this very issue while driving earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your brand has eight stores in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, located in eight cities, including Kingston, </span><span>Solariae</span><span>, </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, and Concord. It will cost about 10 billion dollars to acquire these eight stores along with all of their business operations. The remaining 10 billion dollars will be used as working capital and the normal operating expenses of the eight stores. What do you think? Are you confident about developing this brand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words immediately motivated Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded right away and murmured, "Absolutely, I'm confident. I've always been eager to break into the jewelry-customization industry. It's been my dream. But because my family was so poor that I couldn't scrape together the startup funds, I had no choice but to tuck that dream away in my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus promptly nodded at her and stated, "Well, I'll instruct someone to acquire those eight stores and purchase the exclusive authorization of this brand in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. Starting from now, you'll be the exclusive agent of this brand in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subsequently, he called Diana and elaborated meticulously on the requirements for the acquisition of this custom jewelry brand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately carried out his order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus and Natalie had finished their meal, her phone began chiming repeatedly with incoming text messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were from the brand, while others were from the Industrial and Commercial Administration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The content of the messages basically showed that Natalie had become the only domestic agent of the brand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the messages dumbfounded her at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if what Marcus said was true, she still thought it would require at least a certain amount of time for the process to be carried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, it took them less than an hour to finish their meal, and he had already wrapped up the acquisition of the brand's eight stores and secured the exclusive domestic agency rights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was simply taken aback by such efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, despite the complexity of this matter, Marcus merely made a single phone call. He didn't have to get directly involved in any of the nitty-gritty details throughout the entire process, yet everything was taken care of seamlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the influential figures in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> were capable of achieving such a feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Natalie asked in shock, "Was the acquisition completed so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Marcus chuckled. There were merely eight stores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, when he was in the process of acquiring the four major emerging industry groups in Kingston, which had equity valued at 350 billion dollars, it was completed in just over an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a deep breath, Natalie asked, "Marcus, I really want to know what your current identity is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled nonchalantly, "I'm still just the same old me. What other identity could I possibly have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie bit her lip. Realizing that he didn't want to reveal too much, she didn't ask further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, what a coincidence! Why are you here, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a surprised voice rang out behind Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She subconsciously glanced back and spotted a man and a woman standing behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was tall and handsome, clad entirely in high-end branded attire. He was conspicuous and seemed rather incongruous in this bustling night market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was tall and gorgeous. Though not as luxurious as his clothes, hers were pretty exquisite and decent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hadley, when did you return to </span><span>Solomia</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Hadley Meyer, Natalie was obviously stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on annual leave, so I went back to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> to visit my parents and brought my boyfriend back with me," Hadley smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie remarked, "The perks at the flagship store in Kingston are considerably better. We don't even get annual leave here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley said, "It's not that exaggerated. Our basic salary is the same, and I just have a few days of annual leave."</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
