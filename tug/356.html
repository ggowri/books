  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The convoy of Maybach sedans rolled in like a parade of royalty, sleek, polished, and radiating untouchable authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the fleet was none other than a Maybach L5&mdash;the kind of car reserved for heads of state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any car you could buy with cash. It required not only wealth but also government clearance and vetting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chauffeur in a sharp black suit stepped forward, opened the rear door, and out stepped Ryder Cromwell,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only a Deputy Mayor of a capital city of a state, but he walked like a man who had sat in the big chair before&mdash;and planned to sit in it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, even state governors wouldn't have access to an L5, but Ryder clearly believed he deserved the best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Morgan, care to explain yourself? I hear you're trying to suspend my brother from his position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder adjusted his glasses, his sharp eyes locked on Amelia like a hawk watching prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Mayor Cromwell, I'm just following orders from Mayor Benjamin. I'm here to carry out his instructions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's voice was firm, but her eyes narrowed slightly. She hadn't expected Ryder to show up in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it Ryder had a soft spot for his younger brother, Oscar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had pulled Oscar from a lowly project officer position at the Engineering Department and boosted him to Deputy Director in a record-breaking five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much chaos Oscar caused, Ryder always swept it under the rug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Engineering Department falls under my jurisdiction. That was decided at the executive committee meeting. Mayor Benjamin has no right to interfere. Go back and tell him to stay in his lane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder said as he locked his eyes on Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone wasn't a suggestion. It was a command. Every word dripped with the authority of someone who wasn't used to being challenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See that? What'd I tell you earlier? City Hall's my playground. Call whoever you want&mdash;nothing changes. You just made the wrong enemy, pal. If you don't bulldoze that whole pharmaceutical park and start over, I'll make sure you never get it approved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar flashed Marcus a grin so wide it looked painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This man's a threat to public order, deliberately defaming government officials. I'd bet he's a foreign agent sent to stir up trouble. Arrest him on charges of espionage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder issued the order to the people around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a move befitting a deputy mayor, commanding with absolute authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a hollow threat&mdash;it was a legal trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Uswad, an espionage charge was no joke. If convicted, you could kiss your freedom goodbye&mdash;for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder wasn't just playing dirty&mdash;he was swinging straight for Marcus' jugular, no mercy, no second chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's face went pale like she'd seen a ghost. Her breathing hitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never in her wildest dreams thought Ryder would go this far, pulling an espionage charge out of thin air just to crush Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of government agents moved in like wolves circling prey, closing in on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, didn't even flinch. He spotted a chair nearby, casually sat down, crossed one leg over the other, and watched the agents like they were street performers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Mayor, how do you want us to handle him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the agents glanced at Ryder, looking for guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep him here. Make sure he doesn't run. The SWAT unit and the District Prosecutor's Office will be here soon to take him away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder put on a thin, venomous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar clapped his hands like he'd just seen his favorite team score a goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Look at you now, tough guy. Bet you didn't see this one coming, huh? Enjoy your new life behind bars, 'cause you ain't ever getting out! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things were spiraling fast. Amelia Morgan glanced at Marcus, then at the unfolding chaos, knowing exactly what she needed to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers flew over her phone as she dialed Benjamin Mitchell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he picked up, she gave him a rapid, play-by-play report of everything that had just gone down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Benjamin heard the full story, his jaw tightened, and his eyes filled with cold fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expected Amelia to handle things, but Ryder Cromwell had just crossed the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Ryder to get this brazen, openly disregarding him as the sitting mayor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped what he was doing, grabbed his coat, and headed for his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his way to the site, Benjamin Mitchell contacted both the Solomia SWAT Unit and the District Prosecutor's Office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered them to head to the scene immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The SWAT Unit was under the command of Brenden Wilde. As soon as he heard Marcus was involved, Brenden decided to lead the team himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of the District Prosecutor's Office was one of Benjamin's old classmates. The two were so close that people joked they were like brothers who could share the same pair of pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin had tolerated Ryder's power plays for a long time, but it wasn't because he feared him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because he had been quietly gathering evidence of Ryder's negligence, abuse of power, corruption, and bribery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few months, he had collected enough evidence to bring Ryder down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been waiting for the right moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, that moment came through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Benjamin was furious at Ryder's brazen actions, he couldn't deny that this was the perfect opportunity he had been waiting for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could bring down Ryder and help Marcus get the pharmaceutical park inspection approved, it would be a double victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would also be a chance to repay a personal debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus had saved his daughter, Grace's, life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin had always been looking for a chance to repay that debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that chance had finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, Benjamin was already considering how to use this situation to build an even stronger connection with Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
