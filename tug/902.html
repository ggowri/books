He had been acting under Roger's orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation left Marcus feeling both relieved and deeply shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger discovered that the power within his grasp was far more extensive than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Return Essence stage experts from the Ancient Martial Art of </span><span>Uswad</span><span> were now following Roger's commands, which was truly fascinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knock, knock, knock...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus finished taking inventory of the items in his Spatial Ring, a gentle knocking sound came from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, it's me. Can I come in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's voice drifted through the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was unusually soft, carrying an almost pleading tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This behavior seemed completely different from Jane's usual personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in!" Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus initially wanted to refuse her entry, but hearing her voice softened his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane quietly opened the door and tiptoed into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She appeared to have just gotten out of the shower, her hair still dripping wet, and wearing only a white bathrobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, did I interrupt your training?" Jane asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just finished my training session. I'm pretty beat," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me give you a massage then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face showed concern as she walked over to stand behind Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands began kneading his back with gentle movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her technique was remarkably skillful, with just the right amount of pressure, rivaling </span><span>even Pearl's expertise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does that feel good, Honey?" Jane asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having just showered, she emanated a subtle fragrance that Marcus could detect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to Jane's ample chest, Marcus could distinctly feel the fullness of her curves pressing against his back as she leaned in close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation stirred something within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you've been working yourself too hard lately," Jane gently said as she continued the massage. "You barely have time to rest between handling all these situations and </span><span>your</span><span> training. It breaks my heart to see you like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, she deliberately pressed her full breasts against Marcus' back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not too bad, though it does get pretty monotonous sometimes," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The path of cultivation demanded extraordinary patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every practitioner had to spend countless hours repeating the same routines day after day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also had to face various deadly dangers, keeping their nerves constantly on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was still doing relatively well, having only practiced for about six months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Damien, who Marcus had killed earlier, had been practicing for a thousand years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but feel immense admiration, wondering how Damien persevered for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I recently learned some massage techniques and oil therapy. Hold on, let me grab the essential oils! You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> love this," Jane said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane immediately scurried out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within two minutes, she returned with an exquisite bottle in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, lie down on your stomach. I'll give you a back massage," Jane said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jane opened the bottle, the subtle aroma of essential oil wafted through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fragrance wasn't overpowering, but it had a wonderfully refreshing quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One could tell this essential oil was of premium quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked about the price out of curiosity and was stunned to learn it cost twenty-eight thousand eight hundred dollars; no wonder it smelled so divine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Jane's instructions, he lay face down on the bed, and she climbed up, straddling his hips with her legs on either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that brief moment of contact, Marcus could distinctly feel the contours of her intimate area against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane poured some oil into her palm and began giving Marcus a sensual massage across his back.</span></p><div class="pagination">
