  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do now, Mr. Yannis?" Abigail asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's eyes blazed. "Marcus is just a puppet of some faction within the group. Someone's pulling his strings to make him the chairman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail's eyes widened in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's it. Felix must be right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I knew that loser would never get the chance to become a chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's being manipulated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think they're using him against Mr. Wesley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix nodded. "Exactly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wesley's too powerful. Marcus won't last long. Just wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Marcus - Mr. Fitzgerald. I'll make it up to you!" Michelle said earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes lingered briefly on her ample cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful smirk, he asked, "How do you plan to repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle wasn't naive; she understood his implication instantly. "However you want..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Power was the ultimate aphrodisiac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No woman could resist someone so powerful and gorgeous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a bit attracted to Marcus by his brave move earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted something more, she'd welcome his advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come to my office tomorrow morning," he said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's heart pounded, and a flood of improper thoughts filled her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded nervously, her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Diana. I couldn't have done this without you," Marcus said as they drove back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's long, slender legs were wrapped in sheer black stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a graceful shift, she crossed her legs, revealing glimpses of her skirt's tantalizing hemline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I serve you, Mr. Fitzgerald. It's my duty to solve your problems," Diana replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Anthony is an old head in Golden Group, and his ties with Mr. Roger Gellar run deep. Offending him could bring trouble. We must be more careful now," she warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes hardened. "I don't care who he knows. Cross me, he pays."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Marcus was back in his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out the amulet, pricked his finger, and drew blood onto it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The amulet emitted a strange, otherworldly glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, it floated from his palm, pulsing with strange energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the amulet merged with his pendant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, power surged through him, heating his blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His transformation had begun to take place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've reached Stage One of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire! I've finally advanced!"</span><span> </span><span>Marcus shouted, his whole body trembling with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raw energy coursed through his veins, unlike anything he'd ever felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw a punch. The oak desk across the room exploded into splinters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is so amazing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I had got this power earlier, those thugs in the hotel hall wouldn't stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">By the way, why does my vision seem to improve a lot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Focusing on a distant drawer, he could see straight through the wood, every item inside crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit!" he breathed. "Stage One of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire comes with x-ray vision. This is insane!" Marcus exclaimed, his voice brimming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd only seen powers like this in movies. Now they were his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still riding the high, Marcus left his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Diana was now in the kitchen, dressed in a seductive maid's outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carried a plate of steak and bread, placing it on the counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dinner's ready, Mr. Fitzgerald," she smiled warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd only known Diana as the fierce businesswoman, all steel and fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This softer side was... unexpected. Her gentle smile was undeniably enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with his new </span><span>X</span><span>-ray vision, he saw everything - smooth skin, perfect curves, round breasts, flat stomach, and...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana..." he choked out. "why aren't you wearing any underwear?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
