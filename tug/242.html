  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Marcus had always had this thought in mind, but his schedule never allowed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about this? In a few days, I'll head to the southwest and see if I can bring back some crystals," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to build his own power now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magical army on the Serpent's Coil side would need time to grow. If they could mass-produce weapons with energy crystals, that would be even better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, no problem." Diana </span><span>nodded,</span><span> her deep blue eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Diana wore a seductive, form-fitting mini dress, revealing a generous expanse of smooth skin across her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The curve of her body was like a deep, inviting abyss, and it seemed to have some kind of special allure that captured Marcus' attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you looking at?" Diana asked, her face flushing slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you missed me after all this time?" Marcus </span><span>responded,</span><span> his question completely unrelated. As he spoke, he raised the divider in the back of the business car, effectively creating two separate spaces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the driver couldn't hear a thing from the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana seemed to realize what was happening, her face turning even redder, her gaze becoming evasive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though outwardly bold, her personality was more reserved and introverted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was far more conservative when it came to interacting with the opposite sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still remembered the shy way she had confessed her feelings to him just a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you answering my question?" he pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have..." Diana murmured in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently pulled her into his arms, feeling the softness of her body. A surge of desire stirred within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his cultivation grew, so did his cravings, especially after reaching the Fourth Stage of the Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His energy felt boundless now, as if there was no end to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald..." Diana seemed to want to say something, but Marcus cut her off with a kiss. "Mm..." Diana moaned softly, her body trembling in his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a woman of formidable strength, cunning, and power, Diana was as gentle as a lamb in Marcus' arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed her deeply, his hands roaming to her ample chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the standards of his circle, Diana was the largest among his women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Jane could rival her in that regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, while Jane had a fuller figure, which made her larger due to fat, Diana stood at about 170 cm and weighed only around 50 kilograms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her figure was slim, but her chest was not only large but firm and smooth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand slipped beneath Diana's ultra-short dress like a serpent, gliding up her abdomen until it finally reached that enticing peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teasing touch awakened her senses, and the soft rise grew firm under his skillful caress. Even the slightest movement sent electric shivers coursing through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... you're so naughty... I can't take it anymore..." Diana's face flushed with heat, her breath coming in shallow gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A certain warmth betrayed her rising desire, her body writhing with an uncontrollable need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips parted, releasing soft, seductive moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't take it anymore," Marcus murmured, his voice low and full of intent, "then I won't make you wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a sly chuckle, his hand slipping into Diana's underwear, exploring the damp, mysterious heat waiting beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, not here! The driver is still driving... and we'll be home soon," Diana protested, grasping Marcus' hand and shaking her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Marcus withdrew his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had entertained the idea of an intimate moment right there in the moving car, but Diana's hesitation made him reconsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her first time, after all, and he didn't want it to feel rushed or careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to wait&mdash;Diana wasn't rejecting him anymore, which meant it was only a matter of time. As the saying goes, good things are worth waiting for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absentmindedly, Marcus raised his damp fingers to his nose for a quick sniff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, her scent was faintly floral, though different from Melina's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina carried the delicate fragrance of orchids, while Diana's scent reminded him of red roses&mdash;richer, bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're impossible! That's so embarrassing..." Diana's cheeks turned an even deeper shade of red as she saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly fumbled through her bag, pulling out a packet of wet wipes. She wiped Marcus' hand clean before discreetly tending to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a touch of composure regained, she pulled out a compact and freshened her makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really don't realize how amazing you smell, do you?" Marcus asked, his voice low and teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot him a sharp look. "You're such a liar. No wonder so many women fall for your tricks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not lying," Marcus replied, his tone suddenly earnest. "I mean it."</span></p><div class="pagination">
