  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's body swayed with every movement; her skin flushed a deep red, and tiny beads of sweat formed on her delicate pores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' fierce assault, Yvonne couldn't hold on much longer and quickly begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it was her first time, Marcus didn't dare to continue for too long. He swept Yvonne into his arms and laid her back on the sofa, spreading her long, slender legs apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched one final assault, and after a tempestuous wave of attacks, Marcus finally released himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne, overwhelmed by an intense wave of bliss, reached the peak of ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, Marcus climbed off Yvonne's tempting body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne seemed to regain her senses and hurriedly covered herself with her clothes. "You naughty devil, don't look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rolled his eyes. "I've seen everything there was to see. Why can't I look now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne immediately pressed her hand over Marcus' mouth. "Don't you dare say a word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she swiftly dashed into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head and smiled, settling comfortably on the sofa and lighting a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep drag, letting the smoke swirl in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt utterly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conquering Yvonne had been his long-held desire, and today, it was finally fulfilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the sound of water from the bathroom echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stubbed out his cigarette, slowly pushed open the bathroom door, and stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne instinctively let out a sharp cry, wrapping a towel around her beautiful body. "What are you doing, you bad boy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Taking a shower, what else would I be doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's another bathroom over there. Go use that one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I want to shower with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the sound of Yvonne's breathless sighs filled the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they finished showering, it was already past six in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus received a WhatsApp message from Maxine: [Do you have time tomorrow night? I'd like to invite you to dinner.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine had mentioned wanting to have dinner with him before, so refusing this time would be awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Marcus agreed, setting the time for 8:00 PM the following evening at Solomia's finest restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some more time spent with Yvonne, Marcus left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was at Yvonne's house, and he didn't want to end up in the same situation as last time when Emily caught him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Bayside Villa, Marcus began his training with the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several days of continuous practice, his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire was showing signs of advancing to Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus estimated that it would still take some time before he could break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, his Fireball and Lightning had also improved significantly. He could now release attacks that were almost as powerful as those of a Stage Three Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Marcus, this was a powerful trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, he appeared to be just a warrior with no trace of magical energy, but he could unleash terrifying attacks that rivaled a Stage Three Wizard's power, catching his enemies completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Energy Manifestation, Celestial Reversal, and X-ray vision were also progressing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at Yvonne's home, another scene unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles and Emily didn't return home until after ten in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to exhaustion, Yvonne had already retired to her room to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After washing up, Charles and Emily lay down together on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily, her expression full of curious, whispered, "Charles, do you think Yvonne and Marcus have... You know..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles gave a strange look. "How should I know? Let young people deal with their own matters. It's best if we stay out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily smiled knowingly and proceeded to recount the time she'd caught Marcus and Yvonne in the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles' gaze flickered as he nodded. "Well, it's a good thing. Only by doing this can Yvonne secure Marcus' heart. If she misses him, she might never find someone as good as him again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily agreed. "That's why I came back so late. I noticed some marks on the sofa. Looks like these two didn't hold back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a teasing smile, her face still full of charm despite her age. "Charles, it's been six months since we... you know... Are you seeing someone else? Why haven't you touched me? Or are you just tired of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles panicked and quickly explained, "I've just been so busy with work. And we're not getting any younger. Isn't it a little... undignified?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily shot him a look. "I'm only fifty. Do you think I am too old to enjoy it? I still have regular needs. Even women over sixty have them. Why can't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left Charles speechless.</span></p><div class="pagination">
