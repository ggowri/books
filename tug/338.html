  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, Shaun, and Aiton were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could hardly fathom that Marcus' casual punch had such overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining wizard was terrified, attempting to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't going to let him get away. With a swift motion, he turned and slammed his fist into the wizard's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wizard hurriedly dodged, narrowly avoiding Marcus' punch. "The peak of Ancient Martial Stage Four? How is this possible? It's only been a month. How did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't respond. Instead, he threw another punch, this time with even more lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wizard had no chance to resist. The punch landed with brutal force, striking his chest and sending him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bloodied hole appeared in his chest, and his internal organs were pulverized by the shockwave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pungent stench of blood filled the air, making the surroundings feel colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun and Aiton were ghastly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiton tried to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could move, Marcus' hand clamped down on his shoulder. "Do you think you can escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiton broke into a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Marcus in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this moment, he never imagined that Marcus' power could have grown to such an extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known, he wouldn't have come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you spare me, I'm willing to pay any price," Aiton begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "I'm not interested in your wealth. Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched a punch directly at Aiton's head. The impact was so fierce that Aiton's skull exploded. Brain matter and fragments of bone splattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene sent Shaun into a complete stupor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs turned to jelly, and before he could control himself, a hot, unpleasant warmth spread through his pants. The stench of urine quickly filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't kill me," Shaun begged, trembling as he stumbled backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you so arrogant earlier?" Marcus said, his voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took step after step toward Shaun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun had humiliated Maxine not long ago. There was no way Marcus was going to let him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong. I won't do it again. Please, don't kill me. I don't want to die." Shaun dropped to his knees, letting go of his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To hell!" Marcus snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a pistol and aimed it at Shaun's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunshot echoed, and Shaun's body went limp before it collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus put the gun away and turned to look at Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood frozen, shocked by the brutality of what she had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine snapped back to reality. "I didn't expect you to be so strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "It's just a few lowly creatures. Not worth mentioning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You destroyed eight cyborgs and two wizards. You're more than strong," she muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even seem human anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you killed Shaun and Aiton. Their families are sure to come after you for revenge. You should be careful," she warned with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed dismissively, "The fact that they attacked me means their families must have given them the go-ahead. Such families are already doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within a month, I'll make sure they vanish from this world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around him was chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough about them. Tell me about the mission you mentioned earlier," Marcus said, shifting the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine took a deep breath. "Let's talk in the car. I don't want to see this bloody scene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and used his power to incinerate the bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a matter of seconds, those bodies and the eight cyborgs were reduced to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight once again left Maxine shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally understood that Marcus wasn't an ordinary human being. His combat prowess was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he have a variety of lethal techniques at his disposal, but he could casually summon flames to obliterate evidence with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skill was so practiced that it was clear he had done similar things many times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization sent a chill down Maxine's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them got into the police jeep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started, "This mission is of great importance to the organization. Over a dozen departments are involved, and each has sent their most elite operatives. Our unit is just one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we manage to capture the key figures of the Falcon, the upper-ups will give us major rewards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' interest was piqued. "Rewards? Is it money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine laughed, "Not so shallow. These kinds of honors aren't something money can buy."</span></p><div class="pagination">
