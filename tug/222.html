I hate betrayal the most. If I find someone betraying me, I will kill him most cruelly. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang members were startled and immediately responded, "Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you still belong to the Axe Gang. Unless it's necessary, you'd better not mention my name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In addition, Serpent's Coil in Solomia and Death Syndicate are all our people. If you meet them in the future, you should avoid conflicts with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake kept nodding his head, not daring to disobey in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he was extremely shocked. As a person from the underground world, he knew something about the underground organizations in major cities in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been a major reshuffle in Solomia's underground world in recent times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The original Serpent's Coil was led by Edgar, while Shadow Syndicate and Zama Association were destroyed and replaced by Death Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This series of changes happened extremely suddenly within a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This showed that a strong man had entered Solomia's underground world, and he was capable of subverting the three major underground organizations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, this strong man was the young man in front of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baron, who was not far away, was also shocked by Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder his master always claimed that Marcus was someone he needed to respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Marcus was the boss of Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength that Marcus had shown before also completely conquered Baron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in the underground world for more than 20 years and believed that his fighting ability was no longer comparable to that of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was no match for Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even take three moves from Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Blake seemed so vulnerable in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This disparity in strength impressed Baron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he began to admire Marcus even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I understand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake bent over, not daring to look up at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took out a pill and a bank card from Spatial Ring and threw them to Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here is one billion dollars in cash. Use it to develop your gang. Remember, I will come to check your performance in a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is also this pill, which is used by warriors for cultivation. If you have time, take it. I hope you can become a true ancient warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Blake heard this, he looked very happy, and his body began to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knelt in front of Marcus again, kowtowed to him, and thanked him, "Thank you for your kindness. I have practiced Ancient Martial Art for many years, but I have never had a chance to become a warrior. You're so kind to me. From now on, as long as you say a word, I will do anything for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, one billion dollars in cash was already a huge sum of money for the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was enough to allow the Axe Gang to grow twice as big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Blake, this was far less attractive than this pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could earn money as long as he worked hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if he had a lot of money, he couldn't get access to this pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spent his entire life trying to be involved in the realm of Ancient Martial Art, but he failed no matter what he tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected his dream would come true today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Blake, this was as joyful as being reborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I have other things to do. Just remember my instructions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave an order to Blake, then looked at Baron and said, "From now on, Baron will be the deputy leader."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake immediately obeyed the order and promoted Baron as the deputy gang leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also a very gratifying thing for Baron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Happiness came so suddenly that Baron didn't react for a long time. It was not until Marcus' figure completely disappeared that Baron burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the deputy gang leader now! I didn't let my master down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were all insignificant episodes for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he did not expect that his unintentional action today would create the largest underground gang organization in Kingston in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we returned to Sunshine Estates, it was already past eight o'clock at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Marcus had sent a message on WhatsApp before, Josie was not too worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she had changed into black lace pajamas and was half lying on the bed reading a book. Her legs looked like exquisitely carved jade under the light, and it was so tempting!</span></p><div class="pagination">
