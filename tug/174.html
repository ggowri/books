  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus, this matter was just a trivial interruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he felt that since the Hudson family took action against him, it was time to repay them in kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving at the restaurant, Marcus immediately spotted Maxine sitting by the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Maxine had shed her police uniform for a light-colored dress. Gone was the previous tough, independent look; instead, she exuded a more graceful, ladylike charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sat down and couldn't help but keep his eyes on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, feeling uneasy under his gaze, asked, "Why are you staring at me so much? Is there something on my face?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "No. I just found out you look different today. You are very beautiful tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine smiled, teasing him. "So, are you saying I wasn't beautiful before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled. "You've always been beautiful. I just didn't dare compliment you before. I was afraid you'd think I was a creep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine rolled her eyes. The incident at Kingston Airport had indeed been awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the table was filled with an array of exquisite dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine poured Marcus a glass of red wine and smiled, "Cheers to you for everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clinked glasses and drank in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "How's Edward doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of Edward, Maxine's eyes brightened again. "The surgery was a success. Professor Cooper wants to thank you properly, but you left before he could. I'm curious. Where did you learn your medical skills?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Robert successfully performed Edward's surgery, Maxine had begun to regard Marcus with a new level of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I learned that from my elders," Marcus replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine rolled her eyes, thinking he didn't want to tell her, so she didn't press further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was becoming more and more mysterious to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant had an elegant, quiet ambiance, with soothing background music that created a relaxed atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was noticeably more talkative than before. That night, she wasn't as cold as she had been in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always had a good impression of this young policewoman. He felt she was a bit aloof but had a strong sense of justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group of men in suits entered the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all exuded a commanding aura, and at their head was an elderly man with graying hair. They walked over to Marcus and Maxine's table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Maxine saw the elderly man, a cold light flashed in her eyes. "What are you doing here? Why have you been following me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man bowed respectfully to Maxine. "Ms. Burnett, please don't take offense. The head of the family sent us to escort </span><span>you</span><span> home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face hardened. "Tell my father I'm not going back. You can leave now. Don't disturb my meal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man remained </span><span>bowed,</span><span> his expression exceedingly polite. "Ms. Burnett, this is Mr. Burnett's command. I can't disobey. Please, make it easier for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine slammed the table and stood up. "What? Are you trying to drag me away by force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man answered, "Mr. Burnett said if you do not cooperate, we may have to use certain... measures."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a clear threat in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine shouted, "Get lost! Leave now, or I won't go easy on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man straightened up and glanced at Marcus. "Ms. Burnett, are you refusing to go back with us because of this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's voice was cold. "It has nothing to do with him. I'll count to three. If you're not gone by then, you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man laughed and looked Marcus over once more. "Ms. Burnett is not someone you can dream of. I advise you to stay away from her. The Burnett family is far beyond your reach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and asked, "When did I ever say I wanted to reach the Burnett family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man sneered. "Don't play dumb with me. You're getting close to Ms. Burnett. Aren't you trying to latch on to the Burnett family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine immediately interrupted, "Marcus is my friend. Show some respect, or I'll make you regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the elderly man wasn't moved. He waved his hand, and the group of men behind him immediately advanced toward Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine swiftly swept her leg and knocked two burly men to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others rushed forward, all highly trained. Even though Maxine was skilled, she was no match for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the men were about to overpower her, Marcus stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two punches, he took down two of the men, and the rest immediately turned their attention to him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
