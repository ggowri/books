  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of indescribable sensation crashed over Nadia, sending shivers through her entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, she reached her first true climax with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the "cloud nine" Susan had described.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling was extraordinary, far more intense than anything she'd experienced during Marcus' healing sessions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia was truly floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each powerful thrust sent ripples of pleasure through her, an almost overwhelming sensation of fullness, even with Marcus' considerable size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she craved more, wanting him to drive into her with even greater force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Nadia's release, Susan felt a surge of both satisfaction and arousal at the sight before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hot flush spread through her lower abdomen, her own senses awakening once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moans escaped her lips as she began to caress herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia, noticing Susan's reaction, beckoned her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan understood immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She climbed onto the bed, her hands tracing the contours of Marcus' bronzed skin. She leaned in, taking his nipple into her mouth, suckling deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss..." Marcus felt an intense surge of sensation, a jolt that nearly brought him to climax immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan's arrival had ignited his own desire, setting his nerves ablaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire within him roared, prompting him to draw upon the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enhanced by the Timeless Numinous Energy, his virility intensified, and he began to thrust with renewed vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before Nadia reached her second orgasm, even more powerful than the first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body convulsed, her vision blurring as her inner muscles tightened, releasing a torrent of fluid that left her mind blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spent, Nadia went limp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of the moment, Marcus withdrew from Nadia and pressed his lips to Susan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..." A powerful wave of sensation washed over Susan's lips, fueling her own desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus roughly pushed her back onto the bed, his hands cupping her full breasts, while his other hand delved between her legs, stroking her intimately, teasing the sensitive nub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan quickly spiraled towards her own peak of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spreading her legs wide, Marcus positioned himself at the entrance of her wetness and thrust deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft thwack, Susan felt herself filled completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar sensation of fullness returned, and a cry escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to the intensity of the previous encounters, Susan reached her first orgasm almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her core clenched, releasing a flood of fluids that enveloped Marcus completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warm, slick sensation sent a wave of unprecedented pleasure through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to thrust deeply, his pace quickening, his rhythm intensifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rhythmic slapping of their bodies filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan's breasts bounced with each impact, creating a visually arresting display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Marcus work his magic on her, Susan felt a surge of indescribable satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," she gasped, "oh God, it feels so good. I feel so good. I can't take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath came in ragged gasps, the raw, visceral sensations overwhelming her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a sudden shift, she flipped them over, taking control, straddling him and riding him with increasing fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her inner muscles tightened around him, milking him relentlessly and sending him to new heights of ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Susan reached her second climax, her body collapsing onto his, spent and satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia, having recovered from her previous exhaustion, found herself immediately beneath Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could react, he was inside her again, his thrusts more powerful than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined force of Dual Cultivation and the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire propelled Nadia quickly to her third orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Nadia finally understood the true pleasure of being a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," she cried out, her voice filled with raw desire. "Give it to me... all of it... I need you..." She wrapped her legs tightly around his waist, desperate to receive the deepest part of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, eager to fulfill her desires, responded with even more intense thrusts until he finally reached his own explosive release, filling her completely. Nadia crested once more, her body shuddering with another powerful climax before going limp against the sheets. The bed was now thoroughly soaked, slick with the combined fluids of the two women. Where Nadia lay, the dampness was tinged with red, a testament to her lost virginity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having taken Nadia's innocence, Marcus felt a surge of power within him, his cultivation visibly advancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had reached the lesser completion stage of Hidden State, the Peak State now within closer reach. His overall strength had undeniably increased. Both Nadia and Susan, lost in the afterglow of their shared passion, continued to twitch and shudder before finally succumbing to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the two women sleep peacefully, Marcus quietly slipped back to his own room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, he found Ada awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him return from outside, she asked, "Where were you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a twinge of guilt, Marcus replied, "I was out discussing some business with Mr. Stewart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada didn't press the issue, but a woman's intuition&mdash;and her keen sense of smell&mdash;picked up a faint, unfamiliar scent on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could I be imagining things?" she wondered, unsure of her senses. Exhausted, she dismissed the thought and drifted back to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus breathed a sigh of relief and sat cross-legged on the edge of his bed. He retrieved the Spatial Rings he'd taken from Alonzo and Nathan after their deaths and began to inventory their contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo, as an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert, possessed a staggering fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides over a trillion dollars in cash, he had a vast collection of pills and treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a welcome replenishment for Marcus, who had depleted his own pill supply while navigating the giant castle's trials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd relied heavily on pills to get through the nine levels, nearly emptying his own Spatial Ring. Now, with Alonzo's ring, he had even more than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dedicated the rest of the night to cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused not only on the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire but also furthered his studies of the Heavenly Circle Diagram and Shadow Step techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also spent an hour solidifying his recent cultivation gains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, after a heartfelt farewell from the Nuer Tribe, Marcus and Ada left the deep-sea region, returning to the surface.</span></p><div class="pagination">
