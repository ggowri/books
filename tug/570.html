  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila grinned and introduced </span><span>Marcus</span><span> </span><span>to </span><span>Jacqueline and Liz, "This is my boyfriend, Marcus Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline and Liz looked at each other in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Lila had never been involved in a romantic relationship before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite attracting the attention of several wealthy young men, she had never dated with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline and Liz hadn't seen Lila for six months, but Lila had a boyfriend so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lila brought Marcus here. That meant she approved of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, I'm happy for you. However, if he isn't up to scratch, I won't give my blessing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline joked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline was a snob and wanted both Lila and Liz to marry rich men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Lila was a star, the minimum criterion for her boyfriend had to be commensurate with her status!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, mom's right. You're so outstanding. I think you need to find a boyfriend whose status and financial situation are equal to yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, how did you and Lila cross paths? What's your occupation? Where are your parents? And how many siblings do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline's gaze settled on Marcus as she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was young and innocent. Jacqueline wanted to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and replied, "I'm currently unemployed. I'm a fan of Lila. And we met after one of her shows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents are farmers, and I have a younger sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered all of Jacqueline's queries without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was completely forthcoming, withholding nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline said, frowning, "You're still young. Why not seek employment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also come from the countryside and never look down on farmers. But Lila is a star now and has a lot of rich suitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, if you want to marry Lila, work on yourself. Your present condition does not meet my standards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Lila could explain, Liz interjected, "Lila, so many rich men courted you before, but you turned them all down. Why are you dating one of your fans right now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he doesn't have a good family or a job. You plan to support him in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila said, "You misunderstood. Although Marcus doesn't hold a traditional job, he's highly capable. It's thanks to him that I managed to sign with Stellar Entertainment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus was reluctant to disclose the news of his acquisition of Stellar Entertainment, Lila had no choice but to put it this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, you've been kind since childhood. We're just trying to protect you. There's no need to defend him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you're not my biological daughter, I've always regarded you as my baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at how successful Liz's boyfriend is. He's bought a spacious house for me in Kingston. I will be settling down here from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're better endowed than Liz and a big star to boot. Your boyfriend shouldn't be worse than Liz's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline spoke to Lila with earnestness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Jacqueline looked at Liz and inquired, "Liz, what does Abraham's father do? Dragon Tiger Hall? I can't recall it when I try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz replied, "Mom, Abraham's father is the vice general of the Dragon Tiger Hall, Osborn Toynbee. The Dragon Tiger Hall is one of the most dominant gangs in Kingston's underworld. Abraham wields considerable power and is filthy rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz seemed to swell with pride as she spoke of Abraham's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, yes. The vice general of the Dragon Tiger Hall is remarkable. Liz, I'm glad you're dating Abraham. But I'm still worried about Lila."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She came from the countryside but was well aware of the might of the underworld gangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were usually big shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had a strong presence in the underground world and were very popular in business and politics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Abraham's father was the vice general of Dragon Tiger Hall, he must be powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, I'll ask Abraham to introduce you to a bigwig from the Dragon Tiger Hall. I heard from him that the top brass of the Dragon Tiger Hall are all tycoons worth billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz said, "Even the most ordinary among them would outshine your current jobless boyfriend."</span></p><div class="pagination">
