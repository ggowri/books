  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how fast those bullets flew, they never came close to touching him. It was as if his body had some kind of hyper-precise tracking system built in, letting him predict their trajectories with uncanny accuracy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every step Marcus took was effortless, almost lazy as if he were taking a casual stroll. Yet he danced through the gunfire with perfect precision, slipping past every round without breaking a sweat. In no time, he was right in front of one of the fifth-generation cyborgs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cyborg's eyes widened in disbelief. It simply couldn't comprehend how Marcus had pulled it off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, these weren't just any bullets. Not only were they blisteringly fast, but their trajectories were also unpredictable, capable of shifting mid-flight. Even the most advanced weaponry in the world wouldn't have been able to evade them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And yet Marcus had done exactly that&mdash;like some kind of monster. Dozens of rounds came at him all at once, but not a single one so much as grazed him. His movements weren't just fast; they were smooth and effortless. He was completely in control. This wasn't just skill&mdash;it was something beyond human.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What the cyborg couldn't have known was that Marcus had long surpassed the Foundation Establishment Stage. He had already stepped into the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation had broken through to Acquired State Three, and his combat power was equivalent to an expert at Acquired State Seven or higher. Against something like a fifth-generation cyborg? Taking it down was as easy as flipping his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cyborg, sensing the sudden threat, wasted no time. It unleashed an attack in an attempt to force Marcus back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered and clamped one massive hand around the head of the fifth-generation cyborg. With a sharp twist, a sickening crack echoed through the room&mdash;bone and metal grinding together. The cyborg's head snapped at an unnatural angle, twisted completely out of alignment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he was a cyborg, his neural center was still in his head. The moment it was wrenched, his eyes widened in shock. He tried to say something, but all that came out was a garbled mess of sound. Then, his body stiffened before collapsing to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlookers collectively sucked in a breath, stunned beyond belief. No one had ever imagined that such a powerful fifth-generation cyborg would be taken down so effortlessly in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Joel's face also turned ashen. He knew now&mdash;there wasn't a single fifth-generation cyborg capable of standing against Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Joel swung his hand in a commanding gesture toward his hidden subordinates. "All of you, now! Kill that bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his order, the operatives lying in wait around the banquet hall sprang into action. Weapons were drawn in an instant&mdash;firearms, laser weapons, and even several incredibly powerful metahumans joined the fray.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire hall was engulfed in a storm of destruction. Gunfire exploded like torrential rain, bullets, and energy blasts tearing through the air toward Marcus in an overwhelming, inescapable barrage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the sight of the chaos, Cecilia's face drained of color, her heart pounding in her throat. She could hardly breathe, terrified that something might happen to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus didn't even flinch. As the onslaught closed in, a faint glow flickered around his body. And then, in the blink of an eye, an overwhelming force erupted from him, flooding the banquet hall with a suffocating pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The release of a Return Essence stage expert's aura was absolute. For a brief moment, time itself seemed to freeze&mdash;every bullet, every energy beam, every attack from the metahumans came to a halt, locked in place less than half a foot from Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight was both terrifying and surreal. Every single person in the room was left gaping, their expressions frozen in sheer disbelief as if they had just witnessed something utterly beyond comprehension. Then, under their horrified gazes, all those suspended attacks disintegrated into nothing but dust, crumbling to the ground without ever touching Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel's blood ran cold. His face contorted with fear as he stammered, "W-what the hell are you?" For the first time, true terror took hold of him, cold sweat beading on his forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smirked darkly and started toward Joel with slow, deliberate steps. Joel was paralyzed with fear, instinctively stumbling backward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, two fifth-generation cyborgs launched forward from opposite directions, unleashing a devastating assault aimed straight at Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
