  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other members of the Axe Gang looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time they saw Blake use the Tiger Fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of this punch had exceeded most people's imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Mr. Brooks finally used his ultimate move. I want to see how this guy can resist it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people looked anticipated, looking forward to the moment when Marcus would be suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't seem to care about anything at all. Before Blake's fit could hit Marcus, Marcus suddenly grabbed it with his big hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught Blake's fist with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake was stunned, and desperately poured power into his fists, trying to break free from Marcus' restraints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' big hands were like iron clamps. No matter how hard Blake tried, he couldn't break free at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, Marcus spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the sound was not loud, it contained a special energy fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the spiritual power of a warrior. The spiritual power instantly invaded the mind of Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the gap between their power was too big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake instantly felt an irresistible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Marcus, he felt so small and humble, and he was filled with fear from the bottom of his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could no longer bear it. His knees went weak, and he fell to his knees in front of Marcus, his forehead covered in cold sweat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This horrifying scene immediately stunned the other members of the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never dreamed that Blake would kneel in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake was humiliated. He wanted to stand up, but he failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words made Blake feel fear from the soul, and Blake had an inexplicable urge to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me ask you, are you willing to submit to me?" Marcus stared into the eyes of Blake and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This one sentence, like thunder, shook Blake's mind again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake's face turned pale and he could only nod vigorously, saying, "Yes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brooks, you are..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, the other leaders of the Axe Gang all showed a look of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake stood up, glanced at his men, and said, "From today on, all members of the Axe Gang must submit to this gentleman. Anyone who refuses to obey will be killed without mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, he turned around and knelt in front of Marcus again, saying, "Thank you for not killing me. I will remember this in my heart. From now on, I will follow your lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Blake knelt on the ground, he felt unconvinced and humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ever since Marcus launched his mental attack, Blake realized the gap between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Marcus was someone he couldn't offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a glance, Marcus could take Blake's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a person not only made Blake fear him but also made him feel respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had an unruly character but had a natural admiration for the strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved at Blake, and an invisible Numinous Energy lifted Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy manifestation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling this magical power, Blake's heart trembled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was only in his early 20s, but he had already mastered the ability of energy manifestation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Marcus' cultivation was at least at Stage Two of Ancient Martial Art. With this level of cultivation, Marcus could kill Blake as easily as stepping on an ant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene completely frightened Sam and Daniel whose limbs were crippled by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, they all thought that Marcus' arrival was simply courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought they could easily kill Marcus without Blake taking any action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they never expected that it only took Marcus a few minutes to make Blake who was extremely powerful kneel and surrender!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a scene completely overturned their cognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard for them to imagine that a young man in his early 20s could have such terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and kneel to salute the master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as everyone present was immersed in shock, the voice of Blake was heard again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did everyone react and kneel to express their submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Blake was easily subdued by Marcus, so they must be nothing to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to being shocked, Sam and Daniel were also immersed in endless fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had always been arrogant in front of Marcus and even said a lot of harsh words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even Blake could only surrender, so their fate could be imagined!</span></p><div class="pagination">
