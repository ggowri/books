  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Finley's gaze shifted to Marcus. Since Marcus had just acquired </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> and hadn't even set foot in the company yet, Finley had no idea who he was. He certainly didn't know that Marcus was now his boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Aiden beaten to a pulp, Finley's fury was uncontrollable. His voice was ice-cold as he addressed Marcus, "I don't care who you are or what kind of background you have. You dared lay a hand on my son? There's no way you're walking out of here in one piece today. You've got two choices&mdash;end yourself right now or let us beat you into a pulp. Your call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Finley tossed a gun toward Marcus, clearly offering him a dignified way out. The room tensed. Many onlookers couldn't help but shudder. They thought, "Finley truly lives up to his reputation as </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> CEO. He is even more ruthless than the rumors suggest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had expected him to cripple Marcus&mdash;maybe break an arm or a leg&mdash;but </span><span>outright sentencing him to death? That was on another level. But Marcus? He remained completely unfazed. He simply looked Finley up and down before asking, "So, you're Finley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley's expression darkened. Ever since he became CEO of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>, it had been years since anyone dared address him by his first name so casually. He thought, "This kid&mdash;this nobody&mdash;has the audacity to do just that, standing before me without a shred of fear, despite the overwhelming odds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley's brows furrowed. "That's right. I'm Finley. Got something to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold chuckle. "As the CEO of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>, instead of running the company, you mobilize the entire security force just to avenge your son? Not only are you jeopardizing the company's interests, but you're also tarnishing its public image. Tell me, Finley&mdash;what punishment do you deserve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into dead silence. Not just Finley and Aiden&mdash;everyone present was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in their wildest dreams had imagined that Marcus would speak to Finley this way. His tone wasn't that of a desperate man pleading for his life. It was that of a superior reprimanding a subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Who the hell does this outsider think he is, talking down to Mr. Finley Nelson like that?" Disbelief turned into mockery. The crowd shot Marcus looks filled with ridicule and scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden sneered, his voice dripping with contempt, "Are you out of your goddamn mind? Do you even realize who you're talking to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My father is the CEO of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>. He can do whatever the hell he wants with its security forces. And who the fuck do you think you are? Just some bumpkin from nowhere, acting like you're somebody. It's pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley glanced at Marcus and shook his head. "Kid, I didn't take you for a fool, but here we are. You dare meddle in </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> affairs? I don't have time to waste on you. You touched my son, and for that, you'll pay a heavy price. Since you refuse to see reason, I'll just make sure your death is even more miserable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, Finley signaled to his men. Instantly, a dozen armed guards drew their guns, aiming straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the tension reached its peak, Marcus spoke again, his voice calm and unshaken. "The entire </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> belongs to me. </span><span>So</span><span> tell me&mdash;shouldn't I be concerned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead silence. Finley, Aiden, and Ronald all froze. Even Jade, who had remained quiet, was utterly stunned. She had always known Marcus was no ordinary man. The resources and power he wielded far exceeded her expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "But for him to claim ownership of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>? That is something I can't wrap my head around. After all, </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> has long been part of the Watson family's empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just two days ago, it was acquired by someone known only as Mr. Death&mdash;a mysterious figure who has taken the business world by storm. Can it be... Marcus is Mr. Death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade had heard rumors online about this enigmatic billionaire&mdash;a man whose wealth </span><span>exceeded trillions, whose every move sent shockwaves through the market. With strategic investments, he had rapidly acquired major corporations, building an empire that left the world in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought again, "But Marcus? Can he really be that man? It seems too unreal. And yet, he has never once mentioned anything about it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room's heavy silence was broken by Aiden's raucous laughter. He clutched his stomach as he howled with laughter, his face full of mockery. "You? You're saying </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> belongs to you? Are you seriously trying to claim that you're Mr. Death who bought </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> yesterday?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you say that with a straight face? You don't feel even a little embarrassed spewing this bullshit? You're just some nobody from </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, yet you dare impersonate Mr. Death? You must have lost your goddamn mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sparked an uproar among the crowd, their scornful laughter filling the air. The sheer absurdity of Marcus' claim had everyone convinced that he was either delusional or suicidal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley looked Marcus up and down, amusement flashing in his eyes. "Kid, you're getting more ridiculous by the second. Do you even understand who Mr. Death is? Look at yourself in the mirror&mdash;how dare you compare yourself to a figure of that caliber?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald scoffed, "Mr. Finley Nelson, there's no need to waste words on him. Impersonating Mr. Death? That alone is a crime worthy of death. Just end him already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Finley held up a hand, signaling Ronald to wait. He wasn't in a rush. With over a </span><span>hundred armed</span><span> security personnel behind him, Marcus was already as good as dead. There was no need to hurry&mdash;he might as well have some fun humiliating him first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smirking, Finley said, "You claim </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> is yours? Does that mean you're admitting to being Mr. Death? Well, isn't that convenient? I happen to have Mr. Death's direct number. Let's call him and clear this up, shall we?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're lying&mdash;well, let's just say you'll regret it." With that, Finley pulled out his phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in anticipation, eager for the moment Marcus' bluff would be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade clenched her fists, her palms damp with sweat. If Marcus was lying, with all those guns pointed at him, things could go south fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she knew Marcus was strong, he was still outnumbered. Jade wasn't afraid of things escalating&mdash;she just didn't want Marcus to get dragged into this because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden smirked, "You didn't see that coming, did you? My dad has Mr. Death's number. The moment he answers, your pathetic lie will be laid bare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, Finley dialed the number. And at that exact moment, Marcus' phone rang too.</span></p><div class="pagination">
