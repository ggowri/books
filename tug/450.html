  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave Kiera a reassuring look, his eyes calm but sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced over Gustavo and his gang, then spoke coldly, "Let her go and leave. I'll let you off this once. If you don't, you'll face consequences you can't afford."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo and the other men sized Marcus up, then sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where did you crawl out from, kid? Trying to play hero? You're not up for it," Gustavo mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, turning back to Kiera with gritted teeth, he snarled, "No wonder you never let me touch you. Turns out you've got some secret lover on the side. Have you been sleeping with him this whole time? You're nothing but a filthy slut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Gustavo raised his hand to slap Kiera again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before his hand could land, Marcus intercepted it with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare block me? You're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo roared, throwing a punch at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't give him a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A single slap sent Gustavo spinning, knocking several teeth loose as he stumbled back, wailing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard! How dare you hit me? I'll make sure you don't leave here alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo bellowed, his voice filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was already furious at Kiera for rejecting him, and seeing Marcus come to her defense only made him angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his twisted mind, he imagined Marcus and Kiera together, further fueling his hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To make matters worse, Marcus had humiliated him in front of his friends. It felt like a slap to his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Burning with fury, Gustavo gestured to his gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men, wary of Marcus' size and strength, didn't waste time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They drew knives from their belts and surrounded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two of them lunged first, stabbing directly at Marcus and aimed at vital points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear they had some basic combat training because they had no unnecessary moves, just clean, lethal strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But against Marcus, their efforts were laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his martial prowess already at Ancient Martial Stage Six, these attacks were nothing more than child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a few casual punches, Marcus had the men sprawled on the ground, groaning in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Gustavo shrank in fear. He began retreating, dragging himself backward across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus advanced step by step, finally pressing Gustavo's head to the pavement with his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo's expression turned ashen as he stammered, "Y-you better not touch me! I'm with Mr. Deleon. If you mess with me, he won't let you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Gustavo could say another word, Marcus stomped down, snapping the arm Gustavo had used to hit Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo screamed in agony, glaring at Marcus with cold, venomous eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll pay for this! Mr. Deleon will tear you to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the commotion seemed to catch the attention of the man in the Lexus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car door opened, and a young man stepped out, flanked by four men in trench coats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their cold, sharp gazes marked them as well-trained bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on here?" the young man asked, his eyes scanning the scene of Gustavo and his gang writhing on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Deleon," Gustavo said hastily, "we were about to bring Kiera to you, but this guy got in our way and even broke my arm. Please, you must teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man turned his gaze to Marcus with a condescending smirk. "I didn't expect someone in this small city to dare cross my people. Do you even know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His arrogant tone suggested that he was no ordinary figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus met his gaze with an icy smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Should I care? Leave now, or you'll end up just like them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man chuckled and clapped his hands, clearly amused. "Interesting. Even in Kingston, few dare to speak to me this way. You're bold; I'll give you that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the thugs on the ground snarled, "You must be out of your mind! This is Heath Deleon from Kingston's Deleon family! Do you even know who you're messing with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and asked casually, "Heath Deleon? What's your relation to Randy Deleon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He already knew who this so-called Mr. Deleon was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heath's expression flickered briefly before he straightened, pride and respect evident on his face. "Randy is the son of Jasper. I am the son of his cousin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deleon family was the top family in Uswad, and anyone who carried the Deleon last name would be proud to be a part of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh," Marcus replied with a faint smirk, "you could've just said you're from a side branch of the family. No need for all the theatrics."</span></p><div class="pagination">
