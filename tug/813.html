  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the divider slid into place, Marcus pulled Grace back into his arms and kissed her again, more passionately this time, as if their kiss could burn away all the distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had a sinking feeling as she approached the sleek black limousine, already dreading what was to come. Her stomach churned with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus kissed her once more, this time with a force that left her breathless, Grace lost all sense of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the privacy of the space that made her voice grow louder, bolder&mdash;her gasps no longer shy, but full of need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Marcus put a hand onto Grace's bosom, feeling the size inside his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace gave him a nod of confirmation, groaning under her breath. "I did, Mr. Fitzgerald... I miss you so much over the past month, and I miss you every day, but I didn't contact you because I was afraid you were busy... I really miss you, and I want you inside me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Grace turned over and straddled Marcus, slowly peeling off her light-colored dress from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large expanse of fair, smooth skin was exposed, with her full, firm breasts accentuated by the ivory-colored bra, and the deep cleavage seemingly endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with Grace's innocent charm and her stunningly beautiful, flawless face, she was nothing short of a deadly weapon for any man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could no longer hold back. He pulled Grace's delicate body into his arms and swiftly removed the light-colored bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, half of her breast appeared in his line of sight. The areola was fair and delicate, with a rosy pinkness that was the most beautiful he had ever seen among all the women he had encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even someone like Natalia or Nadia, both of whom are young women, seem to have a noticeable difference in the color of their areolas compared to Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such a visually striking temptation, Marcus couldn't help himself and immediately took her nipple in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's nipples were incredibly sensitive, covered with a multitude of nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus' lips touched one, the woman let out a high-pitched cry, her body trembling violently as if struck by an electric shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs were straddling Marcus, and that mysterious area was pressed closely against the top of his thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus kissed her nipple, he could clearly feel that mysterious area becoming subtly moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This intensified the stimulation for Marcus, as the tip of his tongue continuously brushed against Grace's nipple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gradually got perky, and her skin, already glowing with a natural fairness, now flushed with a hint of pink, making her look even more alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus' hand massaged one of her curves for a moment, it naturally moved downward, gently caressing her flat abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his hand slid further down, it finally brushed against the smooth fabric of her underwear, beneath which lay a thick, dark forest of hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers penetrated directly into the shadowy gap ahead, the crack in the dense forest already soaked through with moisture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he ventured in, his fingers brushed against a small, raised bump in the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the source of pleasure for all women, and with just the slightest touch, it sent Grace, whose desires were already intense, soaring to the peak of ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap clenched tightly, and once again, liquid seeped out, releasing a distinct, intoxicating fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Marcus inhaled that scent, it would stir his desires to their fullest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers immediately slid deeper, enveloped by the soft flesh within the gap, as waves of warmth and slickness flowed from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made it easier for his fingers to slide in and out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... um... oh... Mr. Fitzgerald, you're wrecking me! I feel so empty down there. You must fill me in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's body moved uncontrollably. After the first peak of pleasure, she only felt emptier than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense pleasure completely overwhelmed her, making her lose herself in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this girl, so gorgeous and devoured by her lust, Marcus felt part of him was getting bigger and harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, that swelling sensation took over him, and he was about to drive himself into that wetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a sudden screech of the brakes jerked them both out of their passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, Miss, we're here."</span></p><div class="pagination">
