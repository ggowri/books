  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Dragon's Wrath Formation was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Brett had taken control of it, the Tucker family might just stand a chance against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him, Mr. Brett Tucker! Use the Dragon's Wrath Formation to crush him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice from the Tucker family's ranks rang out, quickly gaining support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family had already lost its Four Guardians, an elder, and the three Grandmasters to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their anger burned with a desire for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could even fully process their words, a streak of destructive light came out of nowhere, piercing the throat of the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's eyes widened as blood poured from the gaping hole, and he crumpled to the ground, dead before he could react. Marcus had struck fast, mercilessly, and without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others stood frozen, not daring to speak or even breathe too loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' cruelty was undeniable. Anyone who dared challenge him fell instantly, as if he were erasing them from existence with a mere thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's face twisted in anger, his teeth grinding. "You dare kill my people? Fine. Let's see if you can survive the Dragon's Wrath Formation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Brett waved his hand over the array disc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Runes flared to life, connecting with the massive formation on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it was entirely under his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of destructive energy shot toward Marcus, the power of the Dragon's Wrath Formation surging through the air with an almost tangible rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It spread like a storm, intent on tearing Marcus apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't flinch. He smirked, taking a single step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fist shot out with explosive force, meeting the oncoming wave of destruction head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening crash split the air, and the power from both sides collided in an overwhelming burst of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled, and the shockwave rattled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Tucker family were totally blown away. They never thought that Marcus could stand up to the Dragon's Wrath Formation. When the dust settled, the Dragon's Wrath Formation was in tatters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood there, completely unharmed, as if the destruction had never even touched him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' next step shook the earth beneath him. The array lines trembled and flickered as though on the verge of collapsing entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's face darkened further. Desperation clawed at him. He activated the array once more, sending a new wave of deadly energy toward Marcus, like an army of blades closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space around Marcus was filled with a deadly glow, sharp lines of force aiming to tear him apart from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus only grinned, raising his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heavenly Circle Diagram flared to life, and he sent it crashing against the oncoming wave. The resulting explosion was catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the Dragon's Wrath Formation shattered under the force of his strike. Marcus' attack tore through it like paper, and the energy was scattered into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Marcus raised his hand. Runes began to swirl around him, weaving through the air, and merging into a massive, glowing totem that expanded rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the formation completely enveloped the entire Tucker Estate, covering even the Dragon's Wrath Formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening roar filled the air as the two formations collided with devastating force. The earth trembled, the sound of the clash echoing across the entire Tucker Estate, the shockwaves practically shaking the sky itself. The destructive power was unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brief moment, the Dragon's Wrath Formation held strong, but it was no match for the sheer might of Marcus' formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, the Dragon's Wrath Formation started to crack and crumble under the pressure, piece by piece, until it was completely overpowered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family's members stood frozen in shock, their eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus not only knew formations, but his formation was dismantling theirs, little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deliberate step forward, moving directly toward Brett without a hint of hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat beaded on Brett's forehead as he desperately worked to control the Dragon's Wrath Formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even react, Marcus was upon him, his massive hand closing around his throat with crushing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's face turned ashen. He had never imagined that the power of the Dragon's Wrath Formation would fail him. Worse yet, Marcus had him in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Brett released a surge of destructive energy from his palm, launching a powerful strike at Marcus' chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the attack landed with explosive impact, and for a split second, Brett smirked, thinking he had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as his blow made contact, it felt as though he had struck a solid wall, unyielding, impenetrable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack didn't even leave a scratch on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, the shockwave from the strike bounced back violently, sending a wave of excruciating pain through Brett's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from his mouth as his internal organs were rocked by the rebound. His arm and chest felt like they were being torn apart from the inside, his face pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Your defense... it's impossible!" Brett gasped, disbelief written across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation had long reached the Acquired State Two, and his power should have been enough to crush any opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus stood unaffected, his attack had backfired, and now he was in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had a mocking smile. "How narrow-minded," he scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Brett's strength was nothing more than a joke, as insignificant as an ant trying to lift a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even a flicker of hesitation, Marcus tightened his grip around Brett's throat, ready to end this pathetic struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he prepared to strike the final blow, a shout came from behind. "Don't touch my father, bastard! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser, the terrifying expert at Ancient Martial Stage Nine, came charging at Marcus with a blade that gleamed like death itself, aiming straight for his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power behind the strike was immense, and the sword's sharpness was lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look out!" Gertie's voice rang out in warning, panic evident in her tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes turned icy. He had no patience for sneak attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even a second's thought, he spun around, his fist flying with blinding speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fist Ray shot forward, slicing through the air with unstoppable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's strike was obliterated in an instant, as if it had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fist slammed into Yasser's body with brutal precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser let out a horrific scream as his body was sent crashing backward, the impact so violent it seemed as if he had been hit by a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body was sent flying, crashing into the ground with a sickening thud.</span></p><div class="pagination">
