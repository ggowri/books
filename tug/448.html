  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had no time to think. After so many days without Yvonne, his body and mind were consumed by the longing to have her close. The moment was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, he pulled off her jacket, revealing the black lace of her bra, which seemed to contrast beautifully against her porcelain skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His breath caught, and the scent of her perfume filled the air&mdash;soft, floral, and unmistakably feminine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne gasped, shooting Marcus a sharp glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus immediately pulled her into his arms, his lips pressing passionately against the soft, pale skin of her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed like Yvonne was incredibly sensitive. After just a few kisses, her face flushed even deeper, and soft moans escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus moved lower, his lips brushing over her collarbone, then trailing down to her cleavage. It was as if his entire head was sinking into her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne clung to Marcus, her body trembling as the intensity of her desire reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her skin became slick with warmth, and the sensation spread through her, leaving her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, feeling the urgency, slowly removed the black lace of her bra, his hands lingering as the moment hung heavy between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her breasts surged forward, the delicate pink of her areolas creating a striking contrast against her skin, drawing all of Marcus' attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately cupped her breast, his tongue teasing the sensitive tips with practiced precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aah... that feels so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne couldn't suppress the soft moan that escaped her lips, her body reacting involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even in the haze of pleasure, a sliver of rationality remained. She struggled, pushing against him slightly. "Marcus, we can't... This is an office..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What does that matter?" he chuckled darkly, his voice dripping with intent. "I'm going to take you here, right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ignored Yvonne's half-hearted resistance as he effortlessly lifted her, his hands firm on her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her stocking-clad legs wrapped around him, the soft warmth of her body pressing against his. He could feel the heat radiating from her, a palpable pulse of desire that she could no longer hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He set her down on the desk, his lips finding her tits as his hands worked with urgency, tearing at the fabric of her stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sensual heat between them became unbearable, the air thick with their shared longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His fingers slid in, each movement drawing a sharp, involuntary gasp from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's breath hitched as pleasure coursed through her body, the intensity overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus... please," she whispered, her voice trembling. "Don't... don't tease me like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face flushed with desire, her body betraying her as she leaned into him, the curve of her legs beckoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was inviting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus swiftly removed his pants, his desire undeniable as he positioned himself against her. There was no hesitation in his movements, a deep urgency in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne gasped as he entered her, the sensation overwhelming, a rush of heat and tightness that left her breathless. The intensity of the moment washed over her, and before she could fully process it, pleasure exploded within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body trembled with each wave, the sweet pressure of her release taking over as she clung to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a slow, deliberate movement, he entered her, a low groan escaping his lips as they both felt the connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne felt as though she were being swept away, the indescribable thrill of the sensation making her moan softly with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, it feels so good... please, go faster..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help but voice her desire, her breath quickening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Marcus remembered correctly, she had always been more reserved in the past, reluctant to express herself so openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, in the midst of their sex in the office, her restraint had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This intensity, this connection, was undoubtedly tied to Dual Cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their bodies merged, the flow of this shared energy surged between them, heightening everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pleasure, amplified by their connection, swept through Yvonne in waves, more powerful than anything she had ever felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Completely overwhelmed by the sensations, she gave herself over to the moment, her body responding instinctively to every movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a final, forceful push from Marcus, Yvonne reached her peak, her body trembling as the waves of pleasure washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, she slid off the desk, knelt before Marcus, her lips parting as she took him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rhythm began, slow but deliberate, and even in the quiet office, it sent waves of satisfaction through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first time Yvonne had ever done this, and the intensity of it made his breath catch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to control himself, Marcus pressed her against the edge of the desk, thrusting deeply, his movements urgent and hungry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The angle allowed him to reach deeper inside her, their bodies locked together in a desperate, primal connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's body responded instinctively, her hips arching to meet his thrusts, her legs spreading wider, urging him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus quickened the pace, each movement becoming more forceful, until, with one final surge, he lost control completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne, feeling the rush of it, reached her peak at the same moment, her body going limp in Marcus' arms, the air thick with the aftermath of their shared release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus set her down on the couch, and Yvonne was still catching her breath, her chest rising and falling as the waves of pleasure slowly faded. It took her a while to come back to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked up at him, flushed and breathless, her lips slightly parted. "You... you're such a bad influence," she muttered, her voice still laced with the lingering heat of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus grinned, his hands still on her waist. "Bad? Or exactly what you needed?" His tone was playful, but his eyes told a different story&mdash;one of a hunger that was still far from satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's face flushed an even deeper shade of red, and she bit his shoulder, playfully but with a force that surprised him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus laughed, though there was a sharp edge to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What was that for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned in close, her eyes meeting his with an intensity that made his heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So you'll never forget me. Never forget this," she whispered, her voice full of meaning.</span></p><div class="pagination">
