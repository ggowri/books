  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low murmur of conversations rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, all eyes landed on the stunning woman standing beside Miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That woman was none other than Selena, Chloe's biggest competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Selena was practically draped over Miles, her posture soft, almost inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't just standing with him&mdash;she was making a statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment someone pointed it out, the realization settled over the crowd like an unspoken agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, that checked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd all been in the entertainment industry long enough to know how things really worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe had the talent, the voice, the looks&mdash;hell, she outshone Selena in every category.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chloe played by the rules. No backroom deals and no powerful patrons pulled strings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena, on the other hand, had Miles, VP of Royal Entertainment, in her corner. And that made all the difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Miles had already decided she was getting that Best Female Singer award, then it was a done deal. Chloe could be the hottest star of the year, and it still wouldn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People sighed, shaking their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't sit right with them, but what could they do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was supposed to be Chloe's big moment&mdash;the night that took her from rising star to industry powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she won, her career would skyrocket. She'd be untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she lost, well... who knew when another chance like this would come around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, another figure had caught some attention&mdash;Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walking beside Chloe, he looked about her age, with sharp features and an easy confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was enough to get people looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, they lost interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't anyone they recognized, and judging by his simple but polished outfit, he was probably just her assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people barely spared Marcus a glance before moving on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like Chloe always had a flock of assistants buzzing around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no reason to waste a second thought on just another one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's entrance sent a ripple through the event, drawing plenty of eyes&mdash;including those of Miles and Selena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he spotted Chloe, attending this event safely, Miles' expression tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had sent people to "talk" to her, to make sure she knew her place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those guys? Not a word from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here Chloe was, walking in like nothing had happened. Something about this didn't sit right with Miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Donovan... I'm getting that award, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena's voice was light, almost playful, but there was an edge to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way she leaned in, her breath warm against his ear, made it hard to say no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax." Miles gave her hand a squeeze, his grip firm. "I told you, no one's taking it from you. I sent a message to Chloe&mdash;she's smart enough to get the hint. And if not, well... I'll make sure she's got nowhere left to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slow smile crept across his face as he traced small circles on the back of her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At fifty-something, Miles had two major vices&mdash;money and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Selena checked all the right boxes. Young, gorgeous, and just the right amount of dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention, she knew exactly how to keep him happy in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night had been proof of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way was he letting her go empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You spoil me, Mr. Donovan..." Selena whispered, eyes dancing with something sly. "Don't lock the door tonight, okay? We still have plenty to... discuss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was a faint smile displaying on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't need to try hard to be irresistible&mdash;it came naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every glance, every touch was designed to pull a man right under her spell.</span></p><div class="pagination">
