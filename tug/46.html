  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Marcus was distracted and didn't hit the brakes, the front of the Lamborghini was practically destroyed. His beat-up secondhand car was also severely dented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry about that, I wasn't paying attention," Marcus smiled apologetically. He had no argument about being fully at fault, so he didn't bother to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think a simple apology is enough? Do you know how much my car is worth? It's barely half a year old, and you've already wrecked it like this. What terrible luck I have!" The long-haired beauty exclaimed angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out her phone from her Herm&egrave;s bag and dialed the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's rush hour soon. There's no need for us to stand in the middle of the road waiting for the police, right? I take full responsibility. My car isn't insured, so just tell me how much, and I'll compensate you," Marcus said to the long-haired beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by her outfit, she looked like a trendy girl recently back from abroad. She was covered head-to-toe in luxury brands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, thanks to her impeccable style, none of it came off as gaudy. Instead, it exuded sophistication and elegance, pleasing to the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Did you just say your car isn't insured?" The long-haired beauty widened her eyes in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. I haven't gotten around to it yet. Is there a problem?" Marcus nodded in admission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No insurance? My car is a limited-edition Lamborghini, worth 15 million dollars. Now the front end is totaled, and the repairs will cost at least 5 million dollars. Can you even afford that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-haired beauty placed her hands on her hips, fuming at Marcus's nonchalant expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "This guy drives a secondhand junker. He doesn't look remotely like someone with money. Five million dollars in repair costs? No way he can pay that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he think I'll just eat this loss? Not a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just 5 million dollars, right? I'll transfer it to you now." Marcus didn't seem bothered in the slightest. For him, 5 million dollars was nothing but pocket change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-haired beauty hesitated before taking out her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus added her as a contact and couldn't help but notice her username&mdash;Sweetheart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Her username totally doesn't match her </span><span>type</span><span>. She's obviously a chic fashionista, but her username makes her sound like a teenager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't dwell on it, focusing instead on making the transfer. But after several attempts, every transaction failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that he realized his international bank card wasn't working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's taking so long?" The long-haired beauty pressed him impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My card seems to have an issue. Do you happen to have a POS machine?" Marcus did not lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time he used this card, it easily processed 80 million dollars at the Cedars Villas sales office. He couldn't understand why it didn't work now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A POS machine? Who on earth carries something like that around? If you're planning to weasel out of this, just say so. Don't waste my time with these cheap tricks. If you won't pay, I'll just call the cops!" The long-haired beauty shot Marcus a disdainful look, her tone dripping with skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Marcus was all bluff, and he was someone pretending to have money but unable to back it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I do to make you believe me?" Marcus shrugged helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had billions of dollars in cash stored in his Spatial Ring, but pulling it out on the spot would only make people think he was a wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to hear your explanation, and I can't be bothered to listen! I'm in a hurry right now, so find a way to gather the money and give it to me immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you half an hour. If you can't come up with it, I'll call the police!" The long-haired beauty had clearly lost faith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That limited-edition car was now wrecked. Her heart ached just looking at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about this. We already have each other's contact info. Give me an address, and I'll have someone deliver the money to you tomorrow," Marcus suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Guys like you? The moment you leave, you'll block me, delete me, and disappear into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. I'll consider this my bad luck. I'll file an insurance claim for the repairs, but you have to agree to one condition. If you do, I'll drop this whole thing." The long-haired beauty scoffed with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What condition?" Marcus asked, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pretend to be my boyfriend for a day. Meet me here at 9 a. m. tomorrow."</span></p><div class="pagination">
