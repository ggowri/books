  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, that man, Death, has an incredible eye for business. The four companies were under the Brown family's control for years, but they never saw any real growth. Their combined market value was barely holding steady at around 100 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, after being acquired by Death, these companies have been completely revitalized. Not only have their performances doubled, but their market values have shot up like a rocket. Now, they rank among the top ten emerging industries in all of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. It's truly impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was left in utter astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were well aware that these four companies had minimal dealings with the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, even though they had come to wish Matthew a happy birthday, such lavish gifts were far beyond the expected level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, judging by the gifts, it was clear that they had put a great deal of thought into their offerings. It almost felt as if they were gearing up to compete with the Whitman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malcolm, why are people from Sync Group here? Did you send them an invitation?" Ruth quietly asked Malcolm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did send them an invitation, but based on our business dealings with them, there's no way they should be offering such expensive gifts!" Malcolm responded, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. Let's just wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm shook his head. They had thought of a hundred possible reasons, but none of them involved Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the four groups had already gathered in the center of the banquet hall. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, they all bowed toward Marcus and said in unison, "We are late Mr. Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the words were spoken, the entire hall seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Death? The legendary "Death" was standing right in front of us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be? It was unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people stared in disbelief, their hearts racing with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had previously dismissed Marcus now rubbed their eyes in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's gaze toward Marcus shifted as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Marcus was the infamous "Death" from all the recent headlines?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "What else has he been hiding from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun, Owen, Hazel, Malcolm, Ruth, Stella, Arnold, and even Matthew </span><span>were</span><span> left stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved at Stephen, Lester, and the others and said, "Please, present the gifts now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all responded in unison, their voices filled with deep respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the room were left in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They proceeded to present their gifts, each one a rare treasure worth a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you considered each company's individual gifts, they were no less impressive than the Whitman family's offerings. Together, the four companies outshone even Shaun's gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had anticipated Marcus would make such a grand gesture!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Burnett, I arrived in such a hurry that I wasn't able to prepare a gift myself, so I had my subordinates do it on my behalf. Please forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a slight bow toward Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew smiled warmly, seemingly impressed by the young man's gesture. "Marcus, you're too polite. I already said that the pill you gave me is worth more than all the gifts here. You didn't have to go to such expense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I admit I misjudged you earlier. I didn't realize you were the Death everyone has been talking about in Kingston. My granddaughter's choice certainly shows she has an eye for talent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine lifted her face slightly, and a look of admiration appeared in her eyes as she gazed at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Maxine had once respected Marcus for his methods, that respect had now fully transformed into admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Burnett, I'm Maxine's boyfriend. You don't have to be so formal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved it off with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus claimed to be her boyfriend, Maxine's face couldn't help but flush, and she shot Marcus a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is definitely doing this on purpose, I did not say yes yet!" she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha... Alright, I'll accept it then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, ever the straightforward man, accepted Marcus' gift without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His internal scale had already tipped completely in Marcus' favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Malcolm raised his voice, stepping forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's eyes turned toward Malcolm as he addressed Marcus, his tone firm. "If this gift is being offered as Maxine's boyfriend, then the Burnett family cannot accept it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze for a moment, unsure of what Malcolm meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There can only be one man who is Maxine's boyfriend, and that is Mr. Whitman. Even if you are the legendary Death, you have no right to be a part of the Burnett family!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
