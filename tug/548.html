  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond was momentarily taken aback, but he quickly shook it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Axe Gang was one of the largest underground forces in Kingston, so it wasn't surprising that their rules had gotten out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very possible that, as Edmund had suggested, Marcus was just trying to intimidate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still haven't answered my question." Marcus' voice rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond's temper flared. "Who the hell do you think you are, questioning me?!" he roared. "Boys, take him down! Teach this guy a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he barked orders, the gang members began to close in on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the sound of luxury cars pulling up echoed from the street. A convoy stopped quickly in front of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know that plate number. It must be the gang's leader!" someone in the crowd murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of Blake, a wave of fear swept through the crowd. No one had expected Blake to show up in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond, seeing this, immediately waved his hand to halt his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked forward, his face suddenly all smiles as he greeted Blake with deep respect. "Mr. Brooks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake, however, didn't even acknowledge his greeting. Instead, without warning, he slapped Raymond across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Raymond stumbling backward, crashing to the ground with a cry of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd froze, utterly shocked. No one had expected Blake to go straight for Raymond the moment he arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond scrambled to his feet, his face pale with shock. "Mr. Brooks, what did I do wrong? Why are you hitting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Blake kicked him hard in the stomach, sending him sprawling. "I'm hitting you because I want to! If I don't beat the hell out of you today, I won't be able to sleep at night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake wasn't done. He unleashed a flurry of punches and kicks on the helpless Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond groaned in pain, pleading for mercy, but Blake didn't stop until he was clearly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Edmund and Tina were utterly stunned, their jaws hanging open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in front of everyone, Blake, who had just been violently attacking his subordinate, suddenly bowed to Marcus. "My apologies for the delay, Mr. Fitzgerald. Please don't be angry with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit the crowd like a thunderclap. They were shaking, unable to process what they'd just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund and Tina were in complete disbelief. They never imagined that the gang leader, a figure so feared and powerful, would treat Marcus with such respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond, his mind racing, suddenly realized why Marcus looked familiar. It hit him like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month ago, something huge had happened within the gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he wasn't there himself, he'd heard all the stories about how Marcus had taken control of the gang and reasserted his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he have not recognized someone of that caliber? And yet, he had fallen for Edmund's lies and almost made a move on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the realization stung so badly that he almost slapped himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, wasn't paying attention to the shock in the room. He turned to Blake and said casually, "I told you to properly vet the clients. How could you forget so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake's face fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed hard, clearly shaken, and bowed his head. "Mr. Fitzgerald, it's my fault. I didn't supervise properly. This job wasn't approved by me. It was one of the branch leaders who sent him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I rushed here the moment I found out, but it was already too late. Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm so sorry for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up and walked back to Raymond, kicking him again with a sneer. "Someone, chop off this bastard's hands. This is what happens when you cross Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang members immediately rushed forward, ready to carry out the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond's face drained of color. He could hardly believe the situation he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to strike, Marcus raised a hand and pointed towards Edmund and Tina. "Forget him. Those two are the ones you need to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund and Tina had frozen in place, terror written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words made their expressions collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe Marcus was so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Blake was bowing to him. They had no idea what kind of person they had offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I was wrong! Please, I beg you. Forgive me this time. I'll do anything, anything at all!" Edmund </span><span>cried,</span><span> his voice desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even glance at him. His eyes were cold and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, the Axe Gang members moved swiftly, grabbing Edmund and Tina </span><span>and slamming them to the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
