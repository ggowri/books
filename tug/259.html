  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To welcome Marcus, the middle-aged man hosted a welcoming banquet for Marcus at the Red River Mines that evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the middle-aged man had ordered the dissolution of the Red River Mines during the day, there were still many who were willing to continue serving him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This showed that despite his dirty dealings, the middle-aged man had likely treated his subordinates well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus initially wanted to refuse, but he decided to accept in order to gain more </span><span>insight into the middle-aged man and the matter of energy crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus learned that the middle-aged man was named Cooke Ford, the son of a tribal chief in the rainforest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tribe declined and his father died, Cooke became homeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He accidentally obtained a martial arts manual, which allowed him to rebuild his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his beast-taming abilities, they were an ancient tradition within his tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This tradition was usually only passed down to the chief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before his father's death, he passed this tradition on to Cooke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cooke's father also raised the giant beast and was now at least a hundred years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, according to Cooke, his tribe's beast-taming abilities were only at a rudimentary level, so he could originally only control ordinary birds and beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his opponent were a martial arts expert, he would be helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His growth in strength was due to years of research and exploration, along with spending heavily to acquire some beast-taming texts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was years of accumulation that led to his current achievements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus was interested in beast-taming, Cooke decided to offer all the beast-taming techniques he knew to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that whether it was a martial artist, a wizard, a metahuman, or a </span><span>beastmaster</span><span>, each had their unique abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once these abilities were cultivated to a certain level, they could unleash unexpected power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Cooke's teachings, Marcus was confident that he would soon become a </span><span>beastmaster</span><span> himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the banquet, Marcus and Cooke agreed to depart from the Red River Mines at 8 a.m. the next morning and head to the Southern Market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cooke arranged for Marcus to stay in the highest-grade wooden house, equipped with all modern facilities, comparable to a five-star hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a simple shower, Marcus prepared to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, there was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The door isn't locked. Come in," Marcus calmly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, the door was carefully pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl with long flowing hair, bronze skin, and large eyes walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had the typical local appearance, but her looks and figure were unparalleled, exuding a unique, exotic beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl wore a thin, brightly colored gauze dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the fabric was so thin, her perfect figure was faintly visible, especially her towering chest, which seemed about to burst through the dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, my name is Pearl Ford, Cooke's daughter. My father sent me to serve you. May I come in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's voice was very soft, her beautiful big eyes carrying a hint of timidity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl carefully approached Marcus and began to massage his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands were very soft, her movements gentle yet precise in finding the acupoints on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Marcus felt his shoulders heating up, experiencing an unprecedented sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, how do you feel?" Pearl asked cautiously, looking at Marcus' profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good," Marcus praised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl's hands moved down to grasp Marcus' powerful arm, gently kneading it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the massage, Pearl's firm chest occasionally rubbed against Marcus' shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the rainforest night, Marcus felt a peculiar sensation arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Pearl's hands moved lower, her body almost entirely leaned against Marcus' back, and her two mounds were squeezed and deformed. Pearl's breath brushed against Marcus' ear. "Mr. Fitzgerald, it's getting late. Let me help you rest..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl's voice was barely audible, and as she spoke, she had already removed her thin dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bronze, rounded shape of her chest, like a leaping rabbit, trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned his head and saw this breathtaking sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl's face was flushed, her gaze toward Marcus revealing a hint of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to do this," Marcus said to Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Marcus' first meeting with Pearl, but she was undressed, which made Marcus feel quite embarrassed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
