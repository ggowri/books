  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank, who liked to keep a low profile, was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what Dexter had done, he was still Hank's cousin. Benjamin's arrest of Dexter was a direct affront to Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said to Helen, "Tell Lloyd to stay put. I'll be there in a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Hank's confirmation, Helen immediately regained her confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Dustin and said, "My cousin is on his way. He told you to wait here for him. You wouldn't dare to go against his orders, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin's expression immediately soured, and naturally, he didn't dare to make another move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he decided to stay put and wait for Hank's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, my apologies. Mr. Foster has issued an order, so I can only wait here for a bit," Dustin said apologetically, his gaze fixed on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved dismissively. "It's fine. I'm actually eager to meet this powerful figure who rarely shows up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, everyone present froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected Marcus to respond with such arrogance at the mention of Hank, as if he were on equal footing with Hank&mdash;it was truly unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But judging from Dustin's attitude toward Marcus, they sensed that Marcus was no ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, compared to Hank, the City Governor, Marcus was insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So many people thought Marcus had overestimated his own status and power. In simple terms, he was being a bit too arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus's words, Helen sneered, "You pathetic loser, who do you think you are? Just because you know Dustin Lloyd doesn't mean you can compare yourself to the City Governor. You are nothing compared to him. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smirking, Dexter chimed in, "You're getting cocky. When my cousin gets here, not only will you be in trouble, but even Lloyd will be investigated and fired. Just wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I'll wait right here. I'd love to see what your cousin is really capable of," Marcus responded nonchalantly, unfazed by what Dexter and Helen had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply waited in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that although Hank rarely made an appearance, he was a notorious corrupt official.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been in power for years, he hadn't brought any real benefits to Solomia. Instead, he had nurtured many corrupt officials like Dexter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't want to get involved, but it seemed that Hank was about to make a move against him, so, of course, he wouldn't let it slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter laughed and said mockingly, "This is getting interesting. You're the most overconfident and arrogant person I've ever met. Since you want to play it this way, you'd better be ready for my cousin to step in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager for his cousin to come and teach Marcus a harsh lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, this person's cousin is the City Governor. What should we do now?" Kiera, looking worried, asked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she knew Marcus had an unusual standing and even Dustin treated him with the utmost respect, they were now dealing with someone as influential as the mayor of Solomia&mdash;the true top dog, a person Dustin couldn't hope to match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it was only natural for Kiera to feel concerned about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus only smiled and said, "Don't worry. Whether he's the City Governor or the Mayor, if he offends me, he'll pay the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus so confident, Kiera still couldn't dispel her unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in her eyes, the City Governor was an incredibly high-ranking official.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power was on a completely different scale compared to that of the head of the criminal police squad or the chief of the police department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a person with real power.</span></p><div class="pagination">
