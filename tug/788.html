  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Marcus could take another step, Travis' face flushed a deep red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter that Travis had already reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine. Even before his breakthrough, he was someone no mere junior like Marcus could afford to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Travis, this young man was practically asking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Travis cut off Marcus' path, his voice sharp. "Do you know what happens to people who cross me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Travis had always been prideful, there had been a subtle restraint in his demeanor before&mdash;something he hadn't dared to let go of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after his rise to Ancient Martial Stage Nine, all that pent-up arrogance surged to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he looked at Marcus now was colder, </span><span>more haughty</span><span> than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that a threat?" Marcus sneered, unphased. "Because I'm curious to see what happens when someone like me crosses someone like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell Travis had reached Ancient Martial Stage Nine, but Marcus wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having mastered the Hidden State, Travis was no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they were on the same level, Marcus' ability to fight above his weight was far beyond Travis' capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus spoke, a tense silence settled over the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all remembered how Marcus had struck down Alonzo with a single blow. It had made it clear: Marcus was not someone to be taken lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Travis' newfound power, everyone knew he stood no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why Liam was the first to step in. "Mr. Sullivan," he said quickly, "We're all practitioners of the Ancient Martial Art from </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. We should settle this with words, not violence. Peace brings prosperity, and you both know what's at stake here. Let's not go down that road."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's warning wasn't just for Marcus&mdash;it was for Travis too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much stronger Travis had become, he couldn't hold a candle to Marcus in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it came to blows, Travis would be the one who walked away with nothing but a bruised ego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a friend, Liam felt it was his duty to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Liam finished speaking, Travis' brows furrowed tightly, his irritation mounting. "Mr. Sky," he said, his voice cold, "this guy is clearly looking for trouble. He's disrespecting me and refusing to show any regard for my position. And yet, you come over here to lecture me instead of him? Are you afraid I might hurt him? Tell me, what's your connection to this kid that makes you defend him so fiercely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis couldn't understand it. In his mind, Liam's intervention had to be out of fear that Travis might actually strike Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Liam tried to deescalate, the more it stirred the urge in Travis to put Marcus in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted nothing more than to see this cocky fool grovel at his feet and beg for mercy&mdash;he wanted Marcus to understand just what happens when </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>cross</span><span> him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam, at a loss for words, quickly clarified. "Mr. Sullivan, you're mistaken. The only reason I'm stepping in is because we're friends, and I don't want to see you make a fool of yourself in front of Mr. Fitzgerald. With your skills, there's no way you can match up to him. You should think about your reputation and apologize. Maybe, just maybe, Mr. Fitzgerald will let it slide out of respect for me. If you don't, though, there will be consequences, and I don't want to see you suffer for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam didn't mince words this time. He was done with being polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had laid it all out for Travis&mdash;he wasn't going to sugarcoat the truth just to spare his feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the room seemed to agree. Everyone knew what Marcus was capable of. After all, this was the guy who could take down Alonzo in one punch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
