  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was equally surprised by Robert's appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that matchmaking dinner, his conflict had mostly been with Haley. As for Robert's sarcastic remarks, Marcus hadn't really paid them any mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when Robert greeted him, Marcus simply nodded in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Maxine were also taken aback by Robert's behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Marcus know Robert, but from Robert's tone, it seemed like he was treating Marcus with a certain respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert was a renowned surgeon in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> with a high status in the medical field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Robert was nearly sixty, much older than Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his seniority and status, Robert had no reason to lower himself so much in front of a younger man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but wonder if Marcus had some extraordinary background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the patient? Lead me to him." Robert asked Brenden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden led the way, and they soon arrived at the academy's infirmary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward lay on the bed, his face pale. His broken limbs were grotesquely twisted, with blood seeping from the wounds, a terrifying sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the sedatives, Edward had temporarily fallen unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert stood by the bed, examining Edward carefully. He sighed and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Professor Cooper, how is it? Can Edward ever recover to be like a normal person?" Brenden asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert sighed again. "His limbs are crushed, and it's nearly impossible for him to return to full functionality. Even if we operate immediately, the chances of him walking again are very slim. You should prepare yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden and Maxine exchanged a glance, their faces grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Professor Cooper, Edward is one of our academy's best instructors. Please, you have to find a way to save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden pleaded, unable to bear seeing Edward, so young, in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there were a good way, I'd do everything I can. But given his injuries, it's going to be very difficult..." Robert continued, his tone full of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His injuries are severe, but the fractures are in a relatively good position for recovery. He should be able to lead a normal life again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus' voice interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone paused and turned to look at him, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus was skilled in combat, that didn't mean he knew anything about medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, openly contradicting Robert, a well-known surgeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Benjamin, Brenden, and Maxine uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They feared Robert would snap back at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the young doctor who had come with Robert couldn't hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Professor Cooper has already examined the patient. I suggest outsiders don't interfere. Do you think you know better than Professor Cooper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the young doctor could say more, Robert snapped at him. "Quiet! Mr. Fitzgerald is speaking with me. Stay out of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young doctor's face darkened, and he immediately fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Robert had learned from Charles that Marcus was the amazing healer who had cured cancer at Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his opinion of Marcus was completely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Cancer was universally regarded as an incurable disease, and Marcus had managed to cure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an experienced medical expert, Robert was in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So even in his area of expertise, surgery, Robert didn't dare to challenge Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin, Brenden, and Maxine were stunned once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt Robert's behavior was growing more and more unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This highly respected surgeon was acting like a different person when he spoke to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what do you suggest? I'm all ears!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert didn't care about the puzzled looks of others. He respectfully turned to Marcus for guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't speak. He pulled out some paper and quickly sketched a surgical diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the drawing was rough, it was simple and easy to understand for professionals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few brief strokes, Marcus conveyed the essence of the procedure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's eyes widened in surprise, and he trembled with excitement. "Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've performed thousands of surgeries in my career, but I've never seen anything so ingenious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you've done me a huge favor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Robert bowed deeply to Marcus right there in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left everyone frozen in shock. They couldn't believe their eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
