  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia's words had barely fallen when members of the McHale family stepped forward and seized Tobias and Luna without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tobias and Luna's faces twisted with dread, their eyes flickering with despair. They had once harbored grand ambitions&mdash;helping Joel seize control of the family so they could secure a stake in McHale Pharmaceuticals Group and finally break free from the grind of working under others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna, in particular, had dreamed of trampling Cecilia beneath her feet, turning her into nothing more than a servant. But now, all those illusions had shattered into dust. The only future awaiting them was imprisonment&mdash;a lifetime locked away in the dungeons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, the other McHale family members who had sided with Joel fell silent, their hearts pounding in fear. None of them dared to breathe too loudly, terrified that they might be next.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And sure enough, Cecilia wasted no time giving the order&mdash;everyone connected to Joel was to be thoroughly investigated and taken down immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Rhett struggled to his feet, his frail frame trembling as he stepped toward Marcus. Rhett's face was filled with gratitude as he said, "Thank you, young man. Thank you for helping the McHale family survive this crisis. You're our family's savior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved a hand dismissively. "No need for thanks, Sir McHale. Ms. McHale is my friend. It was no trouble at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rhett's gaze lingered on Marcus, admiration shining in his eyes. "I never expected Cecilia to have a friend like you. It's truly a blessing for our family!" He had witnessed everything&mdash;how Marcus had single-handedly subdued the opposition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Rhett wasn't a Wizard or a warrior like those who practiced cultivation, he </span><span>had spent decades navigating power struggles and had encountered plenty of formidable figures. But Marcus' display of strength had still left him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus turned his attention to Rhett and said, "Stay still, Sir McHale. I'll remove the micro-explosive in your body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he activated his X-ray vision, instantly scanning Rhett's internal structure and pinpointing the exact location of the miniature bomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, channeling his immense Timeless Numinous Energy, Marcus carefully disintegrated the explosive bit by bit. This method ensured that Rhett wouldn't feel any pain during the process.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than two minutes, a wave of warmth spread through Rhett's body. The foreign sensation that had been lodged inside him vanished completely, leaving him feeling lighter and more at ease than he had in years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus also took the opportunity to treat some of Rhett's long-standing ailments. As soon as Marcus withdrew the Timeless Numinous Energy, Rhett felt an instant wave of clarity and vitality. His complexion looked noticeably healthier, with a rosy glow that hadn't been there before. When he stood up, it was as if he had shed ten years off his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I feel more energetic than I have in years. What just happened?" Rhett asked in disbelief, his voice filled with excitement. He could feel a long-lost strength coursing through him, making his heart race with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia hurried over, her face brimming with joy as she said, "It must be Mr. Fitzgerald, Grandpa! He must have helped treat you and gotten rid of some of those lingering health problems!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had already cured her congenital heart disease before, so she figured there wasn't much he couldn't fix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially after witnessing his almost otherworldly display of power earlier. It only made Cecilia trust him even more. In her eyes, he was nothing short of a miracle worker&mdash;someone who could do the impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that, Rhett's face was filled with shock. "Are you serious, Cecilia?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
