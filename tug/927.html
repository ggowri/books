My performance may not be perfect. I hope you don't mind. I will do better in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice was extremely weak and pitiful, which made Marcus unable to help but hold her in his arms and say, "Don't say that. You have done well enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia asked, "Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded and kissed Cecilia's forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia hugged Marcus' strong body tightly, as if she never wanted to be separated from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia asked with some concern, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I gave myself to you. Do you think I am a slut?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She liked Marcus too much, so she didn't want him to think that there were flaws in her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to try her best to show her best side to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "Don't think too much. I won't think of you like that. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia was relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they didn't notice that Rhett was standing outside the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to have something to tell Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he was about to raise his hand to knock on the door, he heard a sound in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He went to Cecilia's room just now but didn't see her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rhett realized immediately, and a knowing smile appeared on his wrinkled face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned and left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't seem to want to let Cecilia go. After some rest, he started to fuck her for the second time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It lasted longer than the last time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the previous experience, Cecilia seemed to be more relaxed than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were completely immersed in endless lust.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, with the combined bonus of Dual Cultivation power and Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, Marcus made Cecilia climax seven more times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia was extremely satisfied, and her whole body kept shaking on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed to lose consciousness for a short time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the second Dual Cultivation, Marcus also completely stabilized the </span><span>boundary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next step was the Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, Marcus predicted that he might have the strength to fight Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this was only based on the premise that Diana did not have a strong ability to challenge a higher level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she also had a very powerful trump card, then Marcus would not be able to beat her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
