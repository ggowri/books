When they left the pizzeria, they found a small amusement park nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon insisted that Marcus accompany her to play. Before he could refuse, she dragged him in without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, they walked out of the amusement park, and the sky had already darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dropped Shannon off at the entrance of Solomia University, preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... I'm afraid of the dark. Could you walk me to the dorm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon pleaded. The look in her eyes was one of pure vulnerability, making it hard for anyone to refuse her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was such a contrast to the confident and strong image she usually projected to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing it wouldn't take too long, Marcus agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They entered Solomia University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two strolled down a quiet path lined with trees. In the dim light, everything seemed peaceful and serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the path, there were couples sitting on benches, whispering to each other, adding a hint of romantic atmosphere to the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a sharp sound from the bushes, and a small black shadow darted across the path before disappearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew it was just a rat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it scared Shannon out of her wits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood frozen in place, covering her ears and letting out a terrified scream. Her face was filled with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A... a rat! So scary... don't come closer... please, don't come closer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was momentarily stunned. This reaction completely overturned his previous impression of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't scared of someone like Easton, a Karate 9th-dan black belt, but now she was terrified of a tiny mouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought, "It looks like no matter how powerful she is, a girl is still a girl!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was about to step forward to comfort her when Shannon suddenly leaped into his arms. A sweet, soothing fragrance wafted up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were still separated by clothes, Marcus could feel the softness and warmth of Shannon's chest pressing against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you won't laugh at me, will you? I've always been afraid of rats... ever since I was little..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon clung tightly to Marcus, her body trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that she was genuinely shaken up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face had turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently stroked her hair, trying to comfort her. "It's okay, don't be afraid. It's already gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus tried to push her away gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Shannon tightened her grip even more, murmuring, "Mr. Fitzgerald, let me hold onto you for a little longer... your embrace feels so safe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at him, her face flushed as she gazed at Marcus' handsome features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the dim light, he looked even more delicate and enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was great, and, without warning, Shannon raised herself on tiptoe and pressed a quick kiss to Marcus' lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was just a fleeting touch, both of them trembled involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm so sorry... I lost control..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon immediately felt embarrassed and tried to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instinctively touched his lips, half-joking, "Next time you kiss me out of nowhere, I might have to fight back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon's eyes sparkled. "What kind of retaliation do you mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to hit me? I don't think you could beat me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can try and see for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Shannon really did lean in again, kissing him lightly on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this kiss seemed to unlock something inside Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cupped her face in both hands and kissed her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden, passionate kiss left Shannon utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, her mind went completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't tell him, but that fleeting kiss had been her first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was her very first real kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body went weak, and her heart raced wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hold back. He deepened the kiss, his tongue parting Shannon's lips, and he eagerly tasted her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon's face turned bright red, and the sensitive nerves on her lips seemed to pulse with pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a soft moan, a sound that was incredibly seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't ready to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, ever since he first met her, Marcus had been captivated by Shannon's healthy, sunny image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially her sun-kissed skin, which had a powerful visual impact on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their kiss grew more intense, Marcus' hands began to roam, no longer content with simply holding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They slid down to Shannon's shapely backside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
