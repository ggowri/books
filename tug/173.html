  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Charles could respond, Emily had already discarded her sleepwear, revealing her curvaceous body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though over fifty, her skin remained smooth, her figure still full and youthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Yvonne's beauty had come largely from her mother's genes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Emily straddled Charles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her age, she had shed any lingering shyness and was now fully open-minded and bold about matters of intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Charles was aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily's cheeks flushed as she hurried to open the bedside drawer for a condom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she reached inside, she noticed one was missing. "Charles, I clearly remember there were four of these. Where's one gone? Did you use it on another woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles, feeling wrongly accused, protested, "I've been so busy with work, and I haven't even been home for days! How can you accuse me of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily seemed to consider this, her eyes narrowing as she suddenly turned flushed. "Could it have been Yvonne who took it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles nodded. "That's probably it. She's the only other one here, and Marcus was just here today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily clutched her face in embarrassment. "Oh no, what if Yvonne saw it? How can I face her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles gave her a glare. "I told you to hide it better, but you didn't listen. It must have been Yvonne cleaning the room and finding it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily paused, then seemed to shrug it off. "We're married. Having this stuff around is normal, right? Yvonne's an adult now. Even if she found it, it's nothing to worry about. Let's just continue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Emily seemed to release, and she immediately moved on top of Charles...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Yvonne were blissfully unaware of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Marcus visited the pharmaceutical company's construction site, then checked in on Jalen and the others at Serpent's Coil before heading back to Bayside Villa to continue his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around seven in the evening, he left again, driving toward the restaurant where he was meeting Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as he turned off Bayside Avenue, two figures appeared in the air, blocking his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slammed on the brakes, bringing the car to a stop at the side of the road, then got out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two figures consisted of one who exuded the aura of a Wizard, likely a Stage Two Wizard, and another who was a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus' surprise, the warrior was none other than Chetak, Falcon's senior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus, Chetak froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly scanned the two of them, then asked, "Who sent you? What do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wizard from Weston Land sneered. "We were sent by the Hudson family of Eldoria to kill you. Prepare to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed coldly. "The Hudson family is quick off the mark. But do you really think you can kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wizard smirked arrogantly. "I heard you easily defeated the semi-cyborg Gibson in the arena. But to me, Gibson is nothing more than trash. And I've got a warrior from </span><span>Uswad</span><span> helping me. Do you really think you have a chance to survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the quiet sound of a blade cutting through the air interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the Wizard could even finish speaking, he let out a horrified gasp. His body froze as he turned to Chetak in disbelief. "Chetak, have you lost your mind? Why would you kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chetak didn't even glance at him. With his knife still buried deep inside the Wizard, he twisted it mercilessly, crushing his internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thud, the Wizard crumpled to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stared at Chetak, a look of surprise on his face. "Why did you kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know why Chetak would help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chetak slowly spoke, his voice low. "You spared my life that day. Today, I'm repaying your kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Chetak turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus watched him leave, a glint of amusement in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt Chetak was an interesting character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to avenge Falcon but realized he wasn't a match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he hadn't begged for mercy, instead remaining steadfast and determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had spared him that day, and now, Chetak had repaid him with this act of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but look at the man with newfound respect.</span></p><div class="pagination">
