  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete stumbled backward, losing his balance and falling to the ground, looking utterly disheveled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Michelle, I'm late." Marcus said to Michelle. He had heard all of the conversation between Michelle and Pete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that familiar voice, Michelle finally dared to open her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus, the sadness in Michelle's heart spilled out instantly, and she threw herself into Marcus's arms, saying, "Marcus, you're finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Pete got up from the ground and stared intently at Marcus, saying, "You're Michelle's boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "Is there a problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete sneered. "You're not as great as she said. After she left me, she won't find a man as good as me again. Besides, I even suspect that you're just someone she found to save the situation. What do you have to prove that you're her boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Marcus turned around, cupped Michelle's delicate face, and kissed her directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their lips met, Michelle's eyes widened, and her body reacted as if it had been electrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never dreamed that Marcus would dare to kiss her in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, one of the busiest streets in all of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was constant, with people coming and going without pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, many people stopped to watch, and some even took out their phones to record this romantic moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete was extremely displeased. Even when she was dating him, Michelle had never kissed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Michelle would let Pete hold her hand, but nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him feel extremely unbalanced, and his gaze towards Marcus was filled with coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lifted his head and looked at Pete with a sarcastic expression, saying, "Do you believe me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete clenched his fists, looked at Michelle, and a sarcastic smile curled the corner of his mouth. "A few years ago, I wanted to kiss you, but you refused. Now, you let this low-life kiss you in public. What a bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle hadn't yet recovered from her previous happiness when she heard Marcus say to Pete, "What do you want with my girlfriend? If there's nothing else, get lost as soon as possible and don't interfere with my date with my girlfriend, or I'll beat you up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete gritted his teeth in anger. Despite his noble status, he had come to see Michelle alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Marcus was indeed very strong. In terms of height and strength, Pete didn't have the advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling threatened by Marcus, Pete felt uncertain and could only respond with a threat, "Fine, once I get back, I will thoroughly investigate your background and make sure you can't survive in Uswad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Pete turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His visit to Uswad was not actually for the purpose of seeing Michelle specifically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mainly had a few business deals to discuss, and additionally, he was set to attend the international fighting tournament hosted by the Solomia Special Police Academy as a special guest three days later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus's dominant demeanor, Michelle admired him more, and her lips still seemed to retain the warmth from his kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ruffled Michelle's hair and said, "You don't need to thank me. Get in the car, I'll take you home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he opened the car door for Michelle and then got into the passenger seat himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aston Martin drove off into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is that man? He's so awesome! If I had a boyfriend like him, I would be the happiest woman in the world!" In the crowd, a pure and lovely girl said to herself with an envious look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only her, but the scene of Marcus protecting Michelle also made all the women present envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the kind of man worth entrusting their lives to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Michelle looked at Marcus's handsome profile, wanting to say something but hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she couldn't help but ask, "Marcus, were the words you just said true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked casually, "What words?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "You said... You said I'm your girlfriend..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
