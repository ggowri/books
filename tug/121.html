  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, his injuries would have been severe enough to require several days of healing to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the medicines left by Ricardo were of exceptional quality. Their potent healing properties far surpassed anything Marcus had used before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few hours, Marcus's injuries were completely healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even felt that his martial skills were on the verge of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that extreme combat plays a significant role in advancing martial skills. Pushing yourself to the limit can unlock untapped potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People often unleash extraordinary power when facing death. I need to seize this opportunity!" Marcus thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus resolved this internally and began intense training with the&nbsp;Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.&nbsp;At the same time, he found a bottle of pills in Ricardo's spatial ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A refreshing herbal aroma wafted from the bottle. According to Timeless Warrior's Grimoire,&nbsp;the pills were known as Essence Rejuvenation Pills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consuming them would significantly boost a warrior's martial cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were over a dozen pills in the bottle. Without hesitation, Marcus swallowed three of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of potent energy coursed through his body, nourishing his muscles and strengthening his bones and organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus channeled the&nbsp;Timeless Warrior's Grimoire's&nbsp;techniques with fervor, refining the medicinal energy that surged through his meridians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the forceful infusion of the medicine's power, Marcus felt his martial skills swelling rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he had reached the very peak of Ancient Martial Stage Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letting out a fierce roar, he unleashed every ounce of potential in his body and made a full-force push for Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, amidst a surging resonance within him, Marcus broke through the peak of Stage Two and stepped into Ancient Martial Stage Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the breakthrough, Marcus's strength underwent a tremendous transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Stage Two, his power had more than doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every aspect&mdash;physical strength, agility, speed&mdash;had improved in all dimensions, elevating him to a new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to face Ricardo now, he still might not win, but he definitely wouldn't be as humiliated as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus unlocked a new ability after the breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was&nbsp;telepathy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same telepathic ability Ricardo had used to track him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even with his eyes shut, Marcus could perceive everything in the room with perfect clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a virtual world had been constructed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could even faintly sense things beyond the room's walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, in the next room, a young couple was enthusiastically engaged in their intimate activities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was gaunt and frail, while the woman was robust, weighing at least 250 pounds. She had the poor guy rolling his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond that, Marcus could observe bits and pieces of what was happening in other rooms within a radius of several dozen meters. Everything was within his awareness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus knew that his telepathic ability was still in its infancy, having only just broken through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching Ricardo's level of mastery would require extensive practice and refinement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't in a rush. This breakthrough had been completely unexpected, and gaining telepathic abilities filled him with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This newfound power gave him another life-saving tool for facing formidable opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gradually ended his meditation as Josie stirred from her slumber on the bed, letting out a soft hum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey... hold me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus sitting at the edge of the bed, Josie opened her arms with a playful, coquettish look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus leaned over, pressing Josie beneath him as he kissed her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she had just woken up, Josie's body remained incredibly sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the powerful masculine energy radiating from Marcus, Josie was swept up in emotion again, her breath coming in soft, alluring gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was about to continue, Leia's voice came faintly from outside the door. "Mommy, where did you go? Are you in your room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound snapped Josie out of her daze. She suddenly remembered that Leia had spent the night alone in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guilt washed over her as she hurriedly threw on her nightgown and opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leia, rubbing her sleepy eyes, walked in and looked up with her innocent little face. "Mommy, did you sleep with Marcus last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Josie exchanged a glance, feeling suddenly awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie quickly explained, "No, no! Mommy just came to Marcus' room. I was with you the whole time before that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Josie felt a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no way she could tell her daughter what had really happened last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, did you bully my mommy? Her skin is all red..." Leia said innocently.</span></p><div class="pagination">
