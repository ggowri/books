  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had heard plenty about Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Brandon hold significant power within Golden Group, but he was also rumored to be affiliated with an Ancient Martial Art Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of backing, Brandon was a force to be reckoned with in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what surprised Marcus was that since he'd taken over as chairman, Brandon had yet to make an appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even during the recent general manager selection meeting, where Brandon's faction was expected to compete, no one had shown up from his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for this absence remained a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Michelle left, Marcus continued to sift through documents before getting into his Alphard business van and heading out to the Winchester family's villa on the outskirts of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard and Melinda had already packed their bags and were eagerly awaiting his arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Melinda eyed the Alphard with delight, she exclaimed, "Wow, Marcus! This van is quite impressive! It must belong to the Winchester family, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, she thought, "This big van is way fancier than Barry's back in the village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be worth at least 70 or 80 thousand dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, this van is mine, not the Winchester family's. Nicole is in the passenger seat; you two can relax in the back with the airline-style seats," Marcus explained as he loaded Richard's family's luggage into the vehicle, preparing to drive back to the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jane pulled up in her BMW outside the villa, stepping out to inquire, "Not settling in here? Why are you leaving so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda quickly hopped out to explain, "Marcus didn't want to disturb you, so he insisted on getting us a place in the city. Sorry for being a bother these past few days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane glanced at Marcus, a flicker of desire lighting up her eyes, but she maintained her poised demeanor, exuding the charm of a well-bred socialite. "This villa has been empty for years. Just let your parents stay here; I'm not in a rush to use it. Why move out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped out of the van and gestured for Jane to talk privately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swayed her hips and followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some decency, not laying a hand on my foster parents. Otherwise, I wouldn't let you off easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane said with a flirtatious smile, "I told you, I'm not that type. I just crave your body. If you're willing to indulge me, I'd do anything for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could react, she unexpectedly reached for his dick in a very inappropriate way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, he stood with his back to the van, or Richard and the others would have caught the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind? What do you think I'm going to do to you?" Marcus snapped, his brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt an urge to push Jane down and show her who was in charge, not out of desire but simply because he found her insufferable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane replied, her cheeks flushed as she shot him a sultry glance, "Bring it on! I've been waiting for you to take me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, now that you're the chairman of Golden Group, you wouldn't look down on an 'older woman' like me, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I'd be interested in you before?" Marcus shot back, his words dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face fell at his response. Just as she opened her mouth to say something else, Marcus had already turned away, starting the van and driving off without a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, just you wait! One day, I'll have you begging to be with me!" she shouted after him, her voice laced with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the van receded into the distance, Jane's expression was a mix of disappointment and determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since their brief sex, she had been replaying that euphoric moment in her mind, realizing that her feelings for Marcus had evolved beyond mere physical attraction; there was a deeper emotional connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus today had thrilled Jane, but his cutting remarks had ignited a fierce competitive spirit within her, awakening her desire to win him over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paid no mind to the lunatic Jane, focusing instead on driving and conversing with the Richard family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, the Alphard minivan pulled into the parking lot of the renowned villa district, Cedars Villas, in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In light of the Richard family's urgent need for a residence, Marcus opted for a ready-to-move-in property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he understood it, Cedars Villas was developed by a subsidiary of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically speaking, Marcus was the chairman of the Golden Group, so these villas also belonged to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, he intended to remain incognito and make his purchase as a regular client.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it was a weekday, the sales office was relatively empty, with several sales staff huddled together chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the Richard family's rustic appearance, the sales team barely gave them a glance before resuming their conversation, no one stepping forward to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anyone here to assist? I want to buy a house," Marcus called out to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several sales staff sized him up, noting his presentable attire. A slender, sharp-featured female salesperson finally spoke, "This is a villa district, sir. The smallest usable area is three thousand square feet, starting at 20 million dollars. If you're looking for an apartment, you might want to check out the sales office next door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her name was Amy Lopez, and she had been at Cedars Villas for two years, having encountered all sorts of clients. She could tell at a glance whether someone was a potential buyer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like Marcus were all too familiar to her&mdash;clearly, they didn't look like they could afford a villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twenty million dollars!" Melinda shouted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
