  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll what? What's that supposed to mean? Could you be a bit clearer? How did my cousin even fall for someone like you? You're talking nonsense! I'm starting to suspect you've been drugging her. You obviously violated her, yet she keeps defending you. You should know, before this, if any man dared to even look at her the wrong way, she would've killed him on the spot. I really don't understand how you've done it. It's like after you violated my cousin, she's not only forgiven you but even seems to have fallen for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Silvia spoke, a strange expression crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the words her cousin Ada had confessed to her during a recent lesson at the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia and Ada had been close since childhood&mdash;more like sisters than cousins, always sharing everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Silvia heard Ada's words, she was shocked. How had her cousin changed so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Ada's change of heart, Silvia had been furious. The shift in Ada's values was almost too much for Silvia to comprehend. Ada, once known as the world's most virtuous woman in the Ancient Martial Arts world, had now fallen for the man who had forced himself on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ada's confession, Silvia had wanted to take matters into her own hands&mdash;find Marcus, and put an end to the man who had defiled her cousin. This way, she could avenge Ada and, at the same time, help her cousin move on from the scoundrel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Silvia was about to act on her anger, Ada had stopped her. Ada had warned that Marcus was far beyond her abilities to handle. That had only fueled Silvia's determination further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Celestial Arc Order, Silvia had secretly tracked Marcus down. Now that she had found him, she wanted to see for herself what made this man, who had seemingly charmed her cousin, so special. How had he managed to completely conquer Ada's heart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My point is, if I win, I don't want anything from you&mdash;not your belongings, not anything," Marcus replied with a smile, his gaze brazenly sweeping over Silvia's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noted that this woman was not only as beautiful as his cousin, Ada, but her figure was quite remarkable as well. She was tall, with fair skin, and her body had the same alluring curves that immediately caught Marcus's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia, feeling the intensity of Marcus's invasive gaze, furrowed her brow. She shot back, "I'm asking you one thing: Can you speak clearly? If not, I'll kill you right here and now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fiery temper was getting the best of her. She hated men who beat around the bush, and Marcus's indecisiveness only fueled her anger. She couldn't understand why her cousin, Ada, had fallen for a man like this&mdash;someone so indecisive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Silvia's mind, a man who couldn't even speak plainly or get to the point was bound to amount to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only need one night with you," Marcus replied casually, his gaze continuing to linger over Silvia's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't because Marcus was shameless, but rather a result of his cultivation in the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. As his cultivation grew, so did his desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his observations, Marcus had realized that Silvia was still a virgin, and her unique aura intrigued him. If he could cultivate with her, it would undoubtedly help him advance in his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Marcus finished speaking, Silvia's delicate face immediately turned red. This redness wasn't from shyness&mdash;it was pure, unbridled anger. Extreme fury!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never imagined that Marcus could be so shameless, taking it to such an extreme.</span></p><div class="pagination">
