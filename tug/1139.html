  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After this battle, Marcus's fame completely spread throughout Lemuria.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the Ophidians saw him as a target to eliminate, but none dared to challenge him again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As time passed, Marcus's ability to challenge higher levels grew stronger. For a time, he was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those foreign invaders stood no chance of survival when they encountered him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, as part of this world, Marcus had the duty to protect it and eliminate foreign invaders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, as the supreme Godfather, his responsibility is even greater.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, Marcus gathered the strongest figures in this world and launched a new counterattack against the invaders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The flames of war spread to every corner of the globe, leaving people struggling and displaced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing such devastation, many cultivation organizations in the world submitted to Marcus and followed his command.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under his leadership, they forced the invaders into constant retreat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though many invaders united to fight against his alliance, they still couldn't pose a threat because of him, the Innate State Five expert, stepping in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus single-handedly changed the situation, eliminating several key leaders on the continent and reclaiming control over various regions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he became the king of the entire continent and a hero in everyone's hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the new Global Alliance General Assembly, leaders from various countries supported Marcus in establishing a super empire to unite all the forces of this world against external enemies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He initially didn&rsquo;t want to agree, but thinking about the possibility of heading to the world beyond Morvalis&rsquo;s Ice Wall, he accepted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to turn this world into an unbreakable fortress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This way, even if there were invaders again, they wouldn&rsquo;t easily conquer the continent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus named the new super empire Atrandis Empire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mysterious Atrandis Continent was Ryan's home during his lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus's decision was also to fulfill one of Ryan's dreams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the Atrandis Empire was established, Marcus spent years building his power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He personally ventured into many secret realms, seeking cultivation resources and selflessly distributing them to key figures in the empire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through his efforts, the Atrandis Empire has grown into a powerful force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The empire has produced several Innate State experts, all of whom are deeply loyal to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation also reached the peak of Innate State Nine, equivalent to Ryan's level during his lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, because Marcus cultivated the Hidden State, it played a crucial role in his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his State is comparable to Ryan's, Marcus knows his combat power has already surpassed Ryan's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the years, his many women have also been doing well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He built a massive, luxurious palace in the Atrandis Empire and brought all the women he had that kind of relationship with here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could live with them and personally guide them in their cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, Alison and Diana's cultivation had already successfully advanced to the Innate State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ada and Gertie also reached the peak of Acquired State Nine, just one step away from breaking through to the Innate State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Marcus's adoptive parents, Natalia, Jane, Natalie, Susan, Nadia, Lydia, Chloe, Morgana, Lucy, Lila, Kiera, Ramona, Darian, Oliver, Grace, Cooke, Maxine, Josie, Michelle, Melina, Yvonne, Pearl, Jalen, Blake, Edgar, Cecilia, Catherine, Shannon, Jade, and others, their cultivation had also reached the Acquired State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In recent years, the development of the Atrandis Empire has been extremely rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once, people outside the Ice Wall of Morvalis called this world a cage and referred to them as prisoners.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus's leadership, the Atrandis Empire has gradually moved toward glory, and its fame has already spread to the world beyond the Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even some people from the world beyond the Ice Wall dare not step here easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As time passed, people from the distant Atrandis Continent also learned about the Atrandis Empire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the empire built by those within this cage, they showed disdain and directly sent several experts to suppress it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cultivation of these experts had all reached the Innate State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They initially thought that with these people taking action, the fake Atrandis Empire would surely be destroyed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, the strength of the Atrandis Empire was far greater than they had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without Marcus taking action, those from the Atrandis Continent were easily slain by Alison and Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides cultivation, he has also been vigorously developing high technology in recent years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After obtaining Eldoria's cyborg technology, he assigned people to focus on research.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, cyborgs have advanced to the 10th generation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A 10th-generation cyborg is as strong as an Acquired State expert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, the Atrandis Empire has tens of thousands of 10th-generation cyborgs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, they can now easily deploy an army of over ten thousand Acquired State experts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faced with such terrifying power, even some powerful continents beyond the Ice Wall feel intimidated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides cyborgs, under Diana's leadership, all Atrandis Empire soldiers now use energy crystal-modified guns.</span></p><div
