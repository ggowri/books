  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia didn't even glance at Nash, completely ignoring his swollen face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Where is the person pretending to be the Special Advisor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't care if Nash had been hit. She only cared about the one impersonating the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash pointed toward Marcus' location and said, "This guy shares the same name with the Special Advisor and has been claiming to be him. It's unforgivable. Ms. Gray, please take him down and send him to the military court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia sneered at Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, the time had come for Grace and Marcus to pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia immediately looked over, following Nash's finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Marcus, she froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Gray, why aren't you taking him down? Not only is he pretending to be the Special Advisor, but he's also acting arrogant and seems to be disrespecting the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military. Everyone here can testify to that," Nash urged as Lydia remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish speaking, he was slapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Nash confused, not understanding why Lydia suddenly slapped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Nash who was shocked. Kenia and the crowd watching were also bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no idea what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that Nash was part of the Special Advisor Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Lydia arrived, she should have arrested the person impersonating the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she hit Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone felt confused, unsure of what to make of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash held his swollen cheek and asked, "Ms. Gray, why did you hit me? Did you make a mistake? He's the one pretending to be the Special Advisor. You should take him down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Lydia yelled at him, "Shut up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you speak again, I'll shoot you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia drew her gun from her waist and pointed it at Nash's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene immediately stunned everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew what was happening anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't understand why Lydia was so harsh with Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia stepped forward and asked, "Ms. Gray, Nash is part of your Special Advisor Department. Why are you treating him like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia shot her a cold look and said, "Foolish woman, listen carefully. He has offended the Special Advisor. Do you understand now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia still seemed confused and asked, "Ms. Gray, Nash has always been respectful to the Special Advisor. He's proud to be in the Special Advisor Department. When did he offend the Special Advisor? Don't slander him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia even felt a little wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia slapped her across the face and coldly said, "Who are you to teach me how to do my job? The person in front of you is the Special Advisor, Marcus. You two have been acting arrogant in front of the Special Advisor. Isn't that an offense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, everyone froze in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even thought they had heard wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared blankly at Marcus, feeling as if they were in a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, they had all believed that Grace and Marcus were lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought that just because he shared the same name as the Special Advisor, he had been impersonating the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never connected Marcus to the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Lydia was saying that Marcus was the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation was hard for them to accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia was not convinced. She asked, "Ms. Gray, are you mistaken? This guy looks like a useless person. How could he be the Special Advisor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Lydia snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then ordered the fully armed soldiers behind her, "These two not only offended the Special Advisor but also insulted him. Their actions are an insult to the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military. Take them down and send them to the military court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her command, the soldiers immediately moved. They swiftly controlled Kenia and Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia tried to struggle, but one of the soldiers pressed a heavy assault rifle against her temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia felt the coldness of the gun barrel and shivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash struggled and protested, "I did nothing wrong. Why are you arresting me? My dad is a military commander. He won't let you get away with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could work in the Special Advisor Department because of his father's connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now these people wanted to arrest him. They should ask if his father agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Military commander? Don't you know the authority of the Special Advisor? You offended the Special Advisor. Even your dad can't save you," a heavily armed soldier said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handcuffed Nash and Kenia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two fell into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined things would turn out this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash was filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always admired the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt honored to work in the Special Advisor Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Nash didn't recognize the Special Advisor and even mocked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else was also shocked. They looked at Marcus with mixed feelings, but mostly admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe that this ordinary-looking young man was the hero who saved Julian on Sixth Avenue in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the Special Advisor of the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military, Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, we meet again," Lydia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped forward and saluted Marcus respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other military personnel followed and looked at Marcus with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and said, "I didn't expect we would meet again so soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia smiled awkwardly, "Yes, are you okay, Mr. Fitzgerald? Were you bothered by these ignorant people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said calmly, "I'm fine. I just wanted to find a place to eat, but my appetite was ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia looked at Kenia and Nash even more coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash spat, "I will call my dad. Even if you are the Special Advisor, you have no right to arrest me. My father is a military commander."</span></p><div class="pagination">
