  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I think so, unless you feel differently." Marcus grinned, his hands resting gently on Grace's shoulders as he locked eyes with her, his gaze deep and intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was momentarily speechless, unsure of how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her first time with Marcus had been stolen, and they'd shared incredibly intimate moments, she didn't feel like she was worthy of being his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Marcus was just too exceptional. He must have countless beautiful, accomplished women around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she, well, she felt like a tiny speck in the grand scheme of things&mdash;nothing special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected anything more from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Marcus had saved her life, helped her open her energy channels, and led her to the path of becoming a warrior&mdash;that was already a lifetime of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the words Marcus had just spoken hit a nerve in Grace, stirring something deep inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she like Marcus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she ever. It was more than like&mdash;it was an obsession, something that invaded her every thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it had been over a month since they last saw each other, Marcus' face </span><span>was always with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially at night, when her longing for him would return, intense and unrelenting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memories of their time together kept flooding her mind, and Grace could feel herself getting lost in the desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew, without a doubt&mdash;she had fallen for this man. And that was something she could never forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was so perfect, so out of her league, she didn't know if she could ever truly keep him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she always kept her distance, lowering herself in his presence, never daring to think of herself as his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hearing his words now, something inside her snapped. It felt like a door opening, a weight lifting from her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even speak, Marcus leaned in and kissed her, his lips pressing gently but firmly against hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her closer, her body melting into his embrace as the kiss deepened, sending electric waves of sensation through her, making her feel like she'd been jolted by a live wire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace let out a soft, breathless sound, her mind going blank for a moment as she struggled to process the overwhelming emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With what little control she had left, she pulled back, her eyes filled with longing as she whispered, "Mr. Fitzgerald... we're out in public; people might see us. It's getting late. How about we stay in Kingston tonight, and head back to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was sweet and tender, her gaze soft and inviting, making it nearly impossible for Marcus to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially after their kiss, Marcus could feel the fire building in him again, the deep, primal part of him waking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had missed Grace as much as she had missed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, thinking of all they had shared, his body responded instinctively, his desire growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded, agreeing with her plan, and quickly dialed the Ritz-Carlton in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Top-tier hotels like the Ritz always offer chauffeur service, and before long, a sleek luxury car pulled up in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, sharply dressed in a suit, rushed over to open the door for them, bowing slightly and saying, "Please, Mister and Miss, after you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Grace climbed into the car, and it smoothly began to drive toward the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they settled into the backseat, Marcus used the remote to close the partition, creating a private space just for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The front and back of the car felt like two separate worlds now, and the driver was none the wiser to what was happening behind the partition.</span></p><div class="pagination">
