  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Finley finished speaking, he moved straight to Marcus, dropping to his knees without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was filled with deference as he pleaded, "Mr. Death, I am Finley. I had no idea you would grace us with your presence today. My son was reckless and offended you&mdash;I sincerely hope you can overlook this, considering my years of dedication to </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>. Please, give me another chance. I swear I will make amends for my mistakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent another shiver through the crowd. Jade, in particular, felt her heart race. Her eyes sparkled with admiration as she gazed at Marcus. She thought, "So he is that Mr. Death, the man who has shaken the entire </span><span>Uswad</span><span> business world? It's almost unbelievable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone held their breath, waiting to see how Marcus would respond to Finley's desperate plea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked down at Finley, his voice cold and unwavering. "Your mistake isn't just about offending me&mdash;it's about what this entire situation reveals about your leadership. If I allow you to remain as </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> CEO, the company will only decline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley's expression darkened. He hadn't expected Marcus to reject him so mercilessly, especially in front of everyone. It was a humiliation of the highest order. And more than that&mdash;losing his position as CEO of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> meant losing everything. That was something he simply could not accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted with resentment as he slowly stood up, his eyes scanning Marcus before he sneered, "I called you 'Mr. Death' out of respect, because I recognize your power. </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business world hasn't seen someone like you in years. But don't think for a second that my groveling means I fear you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may not want to lose my position at </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>, but that doesn't mean I can't survive without it. If you refuse to show me any mercy, then don't expect any from me either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Finley suddenly pulled out a gun, aiming it at Marcus. He wasn't just some corporate executive&mdash;he had served six years in the military as an elite reconnaissance soldier. Shooting was second nature to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus wanted to take everything from him, then he would make sure Marcus paid the ultimate price. Finley's finger tightened on the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could fire, Marcus moved. In an instant, Marcus' hand clamped down on Finley's, locking his grip in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley's eyes widened&mdash;he couldn't pull the trigger. No matter how hard he struggled, his hand was completely immobilized, as if caught in a steel vise. Then, under Marcus' control, the gun's barrel slowly tilted&mdash;turning toward Finley's left knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flashed across Finley's face as he realized what was happening. He thrashed </span><span>desperately, but it was too late. The gun fired. A bullet tore through Finley's left knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bloodcurdling scream filled the air as he collapsed, his left leg rendered useless. Blood gushed from the wound, staining the floor beneath him. Gasps erupted from the crowd&mdash;no one had expected things to take such a brutal turn. And yet, this was only the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still holding the gun, Marcus shifted its aim again&mdash;this time, toward Finley's right knee. "No, wait!" Finley's face contorted in terror as he struggled frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another shot rang out. The bullet pierced his right knee, and Finley crashed to the ground, his legs completely crippled. Blood pooled around </span><span>him,</span><span> his agony painted across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really thought you could kill me?" Marcus </span><span>sneered,</span><span> his eyes filled with nothing but cold amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden, watching Finley collapse in a bloody heap, gritted his teeth in rage. "Dad, he may be 'Mr. Death', but this is going too far. Call Uncle Preston&mdash;he has the military on his side. No matter how powerful this guy thinks he is, he won't stand a chance against the army."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley's eyes flickered with realization. Glaring up at Marcus, he hissed, "You'll pay for this." Then, with shaking hands, he pulled out his phone, dialed Preston's number, and explained the whole process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end, Preston answered&mdash;and the moment he heard what had happened, his fury exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston wasn't just a military officer. He was a selfish, power-hungry figure who had used his position to ensure Finley and Aiden could dominate Kingston's business world. As a high-ranking officer with command over an entire division, few dared to cross him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that someone had dared to humiliate his family? That was unforgivable. Preston immediately decided to mobilize the military to go against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A twisted smile spread across Finley's bloodied face as he spat, "My brother is on his way&mdash;with the full force of the military behind him. You think your money can protect you? Against the army? You're dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murmur rippled through the crowd. Someone muttered, "Mr. Preston Nelson is a high-ranking officer. If he really brings the military, Mr. Death could be in serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "Yeah. No matter how rich he is, money means nothing against the army. If they want him dead, they can kill him without consequences. Looks like Mr. Death has to pay a price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's heart pounded. She knew Marcus wasn't an ordinary man&mdash;he was the legendary "Mr. Death" of </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business world. But even he couldn't possibly fight the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade couldn't help but lower his voice and warn Marcus, "Marcus, a wise man knows when to back down. If things get out of hand, we should just leave. It won't end well if Preston shows up with his men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus just shot her a reassuring look and said, "Relax, they can't do anything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words didn't go unnoticed by Aiden and Ronald, who immediately exchanged a mocking glance. They thought, "This guy really won't give up until he hits a dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Preston arrives, he'll be the one regretting it. After all, those are military men. They don't care how rich you are&mdash;cross them, and they'll deal with you however they see fit, no laws holding them back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that Preston was on his way, the crowd grew eager with anticipation. Everyone was curious to see how Marcus would handle the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the distant roar of engines echoed from the far end of the street. All eyes turned in that direction, only to see a convoy of military vehicles speeding toward them. Wherever they passed, other cars instinctively made their way. The sheer presence of those vehicles was overwhelming.</span></p><div class="pagination">
