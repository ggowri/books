  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually said, "Do to him as he intended to do to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob instantly grasped Marcus's intent, yanked Haley off the ground, and forced his arm down on the roadside. He pulled out a dagger and, without hesitation, struck down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's left hand was cleanly severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He screamed in agony, his face a mask of horror, "Bob, you dare to cut off my arm. My father will not let you go. You and that hick are going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob punched Haley in the face, knocking out two of his teeth. "Save your breath, your father is nothing in front of Mr. Fitzgerald. I advise you to abandon any thoughts of revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Bob cut off Haley's right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's face filled with despair, and he promptly fainted from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the task is done. Are there any further orders?" Bob nodded respectfully to Marcus, fearful that Marcus might punish him for his previous actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You clean up. I'm leaving." Marcus did not wish to waste time on these people. He turned, got into his Alphard business van, and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob breathed a sigh of relief and left with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, pick up the severed hands and get Mr. Brown to the hospital!" One of Haley's men was quite rational.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly placed the still-bleeding hands into a plastic bag and rushed Haley toward the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the freshly severed arms were well-preserved, there was a chance they could be reattached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the function would not be comparable to normal arms, it would prevent complete disability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? My son's hands were chopped off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the headquarters of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, Haley's father, Jared Brown, roared into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving confirmation, Jared immediately dropped what he was doing and rushed to Solomia Orthopedic Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a ward at Solomia Orthopedic Hospital, Haley had just woken up from the surgery on his arm details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared hurried over. "Haley, how are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley, looking weak, said viciously, "Dad, I want that Marcus dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his hands were saved, the pain would haunt him for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haley, rest assured, on Solomia's territory, no one dares to lay a finger on the Browns! Even if that Marcus is likely an executive of the Golden Group, our Brown family is not afraid!" Jared said with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, although he had taken over as the chairman of the Golden Group, was very low-key and rarely went to the group's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, most people did not know the name of this new chairman, let alone have seen him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not surprising that Jared was unfamiliar with Marcus's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence stemmed entirely from the Brown family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Brown family in Kingston was one of the top families in Uswad. The Brown family in Solomia was just a branch of the Brown family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Jared was only a collateral member of the Brown family in Kingston, he was still a member of the Brown family, who had stationed Jared in Solomia for business expansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, his son was maimed, and Jared silently swore in his heart to make Marcus pay the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant offending the Golden Group, he was willing to risk it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus returned to Bayside Villa, where Diana had already returned before him and had dinner ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Natalia had gone to Kingston, only the two of them were left in the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, is Yvonne really your girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so important?" Marcus countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind then." Diana lowered her head and ate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, she had become increasingly concerned about Marcus' personal affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she did not realize this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Diana a little upset, Marcus was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't understand what was going on with this woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been unaccountably angry lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, are you going through menopause?" Marcus thought only women going through menopause would get unaccountably angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, Diana's face turned red. "You're the one going through menopause!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Diana went back to her room, slamming the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Marcus was even more bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He genuinely thought Diana was going through menopause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the villa's doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus opened the door to see a plump figure in his sight. It was Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you find this place?" Marcus asked, somewhat surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My villa was mortgaged by Abigail, and the bank will auction it off in a few days. I'm homeless and have come to you for refuge," Jane spoke pitifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see." Marcus understood the situation and felt some sympathy for Jane's plight, but he suddenly remembered she had a house in the Solomia suburbs and said, "You could stay in that villa in the Solomia suburbs; why come to me instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane replied, "The transportation there is inconvenient, and it's surrounded by mountains. I'm a bit scared..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Jane bit her lip and asked anxiously, "What, are you not welcoming me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "I didn't mean that, just curious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane replied, "Then aren't you going to let me in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt somewhat helpless, thinking, "Sometimes these women are really very inexplicable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just been annoyed with Diana and now had to deal with Jane's moods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but sigh, "Men are really hard done by!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The room next to me is Natalia's; you can take any of the remaining rooms." Marcus pointed to a room on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia is on the left, so I'll take the suite on your right." Jane gave Marcus an ambiguous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Marcus's consent, Jane dragged her suitcase to the second floor and directly entered the room she had chosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..." Marcus felt helpless. Now, he was caught between two women.</span></p><div class="pagination">
