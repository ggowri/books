  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there was no way Marcus would let Albert get away. With a flick of Marcus' </span><span>wrist, an invisible force surged outward. Albert felt an overwhelming pull, like an unseen hand yanking him toward Marcus. His body was completely out of his control as he was dragged straight to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Albert was so terrified he lost all composure, collapsing onto the floor in front of Marcus. But Marcus didn't give him a chance. His hand shot out, clamping around Albert's throat and hoisting him into the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, in an icy tone, Marcus said, "I never thought much of you before. But you just wouldn't quit, would you? You just kept pushing your luck, buzzing around me like an idiot. And now, this is where it gets you. You've got no one to blame but yourself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Albert could even beg for his life again, Marcus' grip tightened. With the speed of thought, a sickening crack echoed through the room, and Albert's throat had been crushed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Albert's eyes widened in </span><span>shock,</span><span> disbelief frozen in them as his body went limp. A second later, he was nothing more than a corpse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wrinkled his nose in disgust and tossed the body aside. Then, his gaze shifted to Tobias and Luna, standing a short distance away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Albert die so effortlessly at Marcus' hands, the father and daughter pair were paralyzed with fear. Luna's face was pale as she stammered, "Mr. Fitzgerald, please... don't kill me! I know I was wrong! I... I never meant to go against Ms. McHale!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't be bothered to acknowledge her pleas. Without a word, another invisible force shot out, yanking her forward. As she was dragged toward him, he lifted his leg and kicked her square in the back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a heavy bang, Luna fell to the floor before Cecilia. Her expression was grim, a mix of pain and deep remorse flickering across her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Cecilia and said, "Now that I've brought her to you, what happens next is up to you. I won't interfere." He knew she had complicated feelings toward Luna, and this wasn't a decision he could make for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia stared at Luna, who had collapsed at her feet, her expression filled with conflicting emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna quickly pleaded, "Ms. McHale, I was blind. I was ungrateful. I bit the hand that fed me. Please, for the sake of the bond we once had, spare me and my dad. From this day on, we'll serve you however you see fit. I promise that we'll be your most loyal dogs if that's what it takes to repay your kindness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she fell to her knees in front of everyone, begging Cecilia for mercy with utter desperation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd held their breath, watching the scene unfold, their hearts still pounding. Just a short while ago, they had all believed Cecilia was finished, that Joel would take over as the new head of the McHale family, and that even Luna would outrank her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no one had expected the young man Cecilia brought from </span><span>Uswad</span><span> to single-handedly flip the entire situation on its head. He had turned the tide, and now, Luna was begging Cecilia for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, many in the crowd scoffed at Luna and Tobias. Everyone knew that he had once been nothing more than a poor blacksmith&mdash;if it weren't for Luna's father pulling </span><span>him up, he would have been nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But greed had long since blinded the father and daughter. They had stopped being satisfied with what they had and instead chose to conspire with Joel, plotting to seize Cecilia's position as the head of the family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So now, no matter what fate awaited them, not a single person felt sympathy. If anything, watching their downfall brought a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite Luna's betrayal, Cecilia hesitated. For some reason, Cecilia still couldn't bring herself to deal the final blow. A trace of pity flickered in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus used Thought Reading to glimpse Cecilia's thoughts and immediately understood&mdash;she was actually considering reinstating Luna and her father's status.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no choice but to step in. "A traitor once is a traitor forever. Ms. McHale, I urge you to think twice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia's deep blue eyes flickered, shock surging through her. She never expected Marcus to read her thoughts so clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words seemed to jolt her awake, snapping her out of hesitation. Her gaze hardened as she declared, "When you betrayed me, you should have been ready for the consequences. You're just as guilty as Joel. You'll be locked away in the highest-security prison&mdash;forever, with no chance of redemption!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
