  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are currently at the Foundation Establishment Stage, and the next stage after it is the Return Essence Stage. However, before you can enter the Return Essence stage, you must find the Return Essence Crystal," Diana explained to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where can I find the Return Essence Crystal?" Marcus asked, feeling a strong desire to break through the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, have you ever considered the possibility that the world we live in is not exactly as we have been led to believe?" Diana gave Marcus a deep look, her tone serious as she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you talking about the world beyond the Morvalis Ice Wall?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was visibly shocked by his words. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm not referring to the flat Earth theory that's been circulating online. I'm talking about a real, existing world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze sharpened as he replied, "If you have something to say, just say it. My ability to accept things is stronger now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana took a deep breath before speaking, "Alright, then I'll tell you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I understand, as you've said, the Earth we live on is not as small as it seems. It's actually a giant sphere thousands of times larger than what we see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The known world occupies less than one-thousandth of the surface of this sphere, and the Norvalis and Morvalis are surrounded by Ice Walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Above the Morvalis Ice Wall, there's a space-time barrier. No known human technology can break through this barrier to reach the world beyond the Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of this, most people still believe that the Earth is as small as the media portrays it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, feeling an inexplicable sense of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words perfectly matched the map of coordinates that had appeared in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vividly remembered when the map first appeared, he had tried to drag the coordinates, sliding them toward the area beyond the Morvalis Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the fog surrounding the Ice Wall had vanished for a brief moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this only lasted for a thousandth of a second, Marcus had glimpsed the world beyond the Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the vast seas, many giant continents were floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each continent was as large as the five known continents combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even surpassed the total land area of all five continents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this vision only lasted an instant before the fog returned and once again obscured the world beyond the Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had tried to drag the coordinates again, but the fog remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus had begun to question the world he lived in but was unable to confirm his doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to know, what does all this have to do with my search for the Return Essence Crystal?" Marcus asked Diana. His main concern was still finding the Return Essence Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I know, the Return Essence Crystal is located within a space-time gate near the Morvalis Ice Wall. If you want to find the Return Essence Crystal, you must go to the sea area near the Ice Wall," Diana continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes flickered as he couldn't help but ask, "A space-time gate? Is that the entrance to the world beyond the Ice Wall?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded faintly. "It should be. However, aside from the Godfather, very few people have ventured beyond this world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' mind was in turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Diana and asked, "You're already at the level of a Demon Fighter, and yet you've never been to the outside world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head gently. "No, I was born in Acoton, and I lived there until Godfather arranged for me to come to be by your side in Uswad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of curiosity, what level of cultivation has the Godfather reached now?" Marcus continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his own cultivation grew, Marcus had been learning more about the world and encountering things beyond his imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even now, he knew very little about his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sure about the exact level, but I can say for certain that Godfather's cultivation has transcended the Return Essence stage," Diana replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many realms are there in the Return Essence stage?" Marcus' heart raced as he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the calculation method of warriors, the Return Essence Stage consists of two realms, which are the Acquired and Innate realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Conservatively speaking, I estimate that Godfather's cultivation is above the Innate Return Essence Realm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Diana's explanation, Marcus was struck with a wave of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current level, he was still at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Eight, in the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his father, Godfather, had already transcended the Return Essence stage and was a supreme expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he had a long way to go if he wanted to become the absolute ruler of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that I'll need to make a trip to the Morvalis Ice Wall region soon," Marcus said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you find the Return Essence Crystal before reaching the peak of the Ancient Martial Stage Nine, there's no need to rush," Diana replied indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, but as he looked at her flushed cheeks, his lower abdomen heated up once again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
