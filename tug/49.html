  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily's brows furrowed even deeper. Leaning close to Yvonne, she whispered, "You knew Mr. Cooper arranged to introduce someone to you today, so why did you bring another man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne put on a defiant expression. "He wants to introduce someone without my consent? I have a boyfriend. I don't need anyone to set me up with any men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily immediately covered Yvonne's mouth. "Stop talking! Mr. Cooper is your father's longtime friend. We can't embarrass him. Besides, the man he's introducing is truly outstanding. Maybe you'll like him at first glance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the people at the dining table noticed Yvonne's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A plump, slightly balding middle-aged man, Robert Cooper, stood up and waved warmly at her. "Yvonne, you're back! Come, sit down. We've all missed you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Yvonne lead Marcus to the dining table, politely greeting everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus took his seat, he noticed a tall, poised young man sitting beside Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This young man appeared to be about Marcus's age but exuded an indescribable air of nobility, clearly indicating a distinguished background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man also noticed Marcus. Their eyes locked briefly, and sparks seemed to fly between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yvonne," Robert said, his gaze shifting to Marcus, "is this young man a friend of yours? Why don't you introduce him to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's brows knit as Marcus </span><span>sat</span><span> beside Yvonne, though his expression quickly relaxed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this is Marcus, just a friend of Yvonne's," Emily interjected hastily, afraid Yvonne might say too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She emphasized the word "friend" as if to underline it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Emily could finish, Yvonne grabbed Marcus's arm and playfully rested her head on his shoulder. "Not just a friend. Marcus is my boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert nearly choked, barely keeping from spitting out the water he had been drinking. His face turned sour. "Yvonne, what does your boyfriend do for a living? Is he as impressive as the person I could introduce to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Robert's displeasure, Emily quickly tried to smooth things over. "Robert, Yvonne is still young. Her relationship with Marcus is not serious. If Mr. Brown likes Yvonne, they can break up immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert nodded slightly at Emily's words but continued pressing. "Yvonne seems reluctant to say, so why don't you introduce yourself, young man? What do you do for a living? And where do your parents work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Yvonne discreetly tugged at Marcus's sleeve, signaling him not to speak out of line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus was only pretending to be her boyfriend, he naturally wanted to keep Yvonne satisfied and chose to stay silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Robert wouldn't let up. "Quiet, are we? That must mean your family background is quite remarkable. Perhaps your parents are executives at some big corporation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an unmistakable hint of mockery in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus detested people joking about his parents and replied bluntly, "Sorry to disappoint you. My parents are just ordinary farmers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere froze for a moment. Yvonne's face instantly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This guy may not have much status, and I don't mind that, but he really shouldn't say such a thing in this setting. Isn't he just embarrassing me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily shot Yvonne a sharp glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This girl is so reckless. She'll bring just anyone home. How could someone like him possibly amount to anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert burst out laughing. "Farmers, huh? Farming is great! Without farmers, we'd all go hungry. Don't you all agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, his tone shifted. Turning back to Marcus, he said, "While there's no shame in any profession, do you honestly think that as the son of farmers, you can give Yvonne the happiness she deserves? People like you should know their place and bow out gracefully."</span></p><div class="pagination">
