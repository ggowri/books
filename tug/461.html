  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If anyone dared to challenge Easton now, they would be thoroughly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who had tried before were not only humiliated but also suffered serious injuries, leaving them in a miserable state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, while most of the onlookers despised Easton's arrogance, their condemnation was mostly limited to moral disapproval. They knew they lacked the strength to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uswad's woman, you're actually pretty cute. Why bother with all this fighting? Why not come to Crankhurst and marry me? I'll make sure you live a happy life," Easton said with a smug grin, stepping closer to Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze lingered on her, particularly on her chest, a smirk spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon spat at him, her expression filled with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She absolutely despised this man&mdash;not just his arrogance, but his audacity to flirt with her. She could almost imagine peeling his skin off if she had the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really don't know what's good for you, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton's face darkened at her spit, his eyes narrowing into cold slits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scanned the crowd beneath the stage, then turned back to Shannon with a sneer, saying loudly, "Tell me, does Uswad have any real fighters? A powerful nation, and yet all you have are cowards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd below seethed with anger, their teeth gritting in frustration, wishing they had the strength to take down this insufferable man. If only they were stronger... They longed to make Easton pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just a defeated opponent daring to parade around like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice suddenly rang out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eyes of many turned toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Easton recognized Marcus, his face twisted in irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus slowly climbed into the ring, gently helping Shannon to her feet. He asked softly, "Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon winced in pain as she rose, her face etched with discomfort, but she nodded, her voice steady. "I'm fine. Just some bruises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, her bright eyes scanned Marcus with curiosity. "Easton's a ninth-degree black belt in Karate and the national champion in Crankhurst. He's no slouch. You're not a match for him, so it's best not to provoke him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled faintly and said, "You've been hurt. Go rest for now. I'll handle him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon looked at him deeply, considering his words. Finally, she nodded and stepped off the stage, though her concern for him lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always been one of the top fighters at her club, but compared to Easton, she felt completely outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, looked like someone with no formal training&mdash;at least none that Shannon could detect. She couldn't understand why he would claim to have beaten Easton before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was he just talking big?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You were just talking about how Uswad has no worthy opponents, but did you forget that you were defeated by me a few days ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' voice cut through the air, laced with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd gasped in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All eyes now turned to Easton with a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton's face turned ashen, his anger flaring. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't talk nonsense! When did I ever lose to you?" His voice was sharp with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stormed toward the edge of the ring, shouting, "I've won over ten fights today already. I'm done here. Uswad's martial artists are a huge disappointment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, blocked his path without hesitation. "You were just shouting for a challenge, so you're not leaving until you fight me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton's face turned red with fury. He clenched his jaw and sneered, "You're really asking for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, he threw a sudden, unprovoked punch at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strike came without warning, designed to catch Marcus off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton had intentionally tried to make Marcus lower his guard, aiming to finish him with a single hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd, already on edge from Easton's taunts, watched in disgust at his shameless tactics. A chorus of boos erupted from the spectators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Easton was blind to the growing hostility; all he cared about was redeeming his previous loss to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Easton didn't expect was Marcus' reaction speed&mdash;dozens of times faster than any ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was meant to be a surprise attack on Marcus appeared slow as molasses to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift movement, Marcus grabbed Easton's wrist with ease, twisting and pulling him forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton's balance was completely lost as his body lurched forward, and in a swift motion, he crashed heavily to the floor of the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted into applause, a thunderous roar of approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The audience, who had long been annoyed by Easton's behavior, finally released their pent-up frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon's eyes widened in surprise, her mouth slightly agape. She had no idea Marcus possessed this level of skill.</span></p><div class="pagination">
