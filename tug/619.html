  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan placed her hands on her hips and stepped forward to confront Marcus, declaring, "I'm captivated by the Tears of the Angel. Let me acquire it. Name your price; as long as it's not excessively high, I'll pay it without blinking an eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing Joan's arrogant attitude, the crowd cast envious glances at her once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a genuinely wealthy individual set their heart on something, they would acquire it regardless of the cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had lavished 650 million on all the jewelry in the store, everyone was aware that Joan didn't give a second thought to such an amount. Her husband, a renowned oil tycoon with assets totaling hundreds of billions of dollars, consistently ranked among the top three on the Solomia rich list. For her, 650 million dollars was merely pocket money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she was deeply in love with the Tears of the Angel, she was prepared to buy it even if it exceeded its original price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Mrs. Jenkins is willing to pay a substantial amount for the Tears of the Angel, he should relinquish it," someone suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not necessarily. After all, he's not short of money," another replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe he'll eventually give it up. Mrs. Jenkins possesses such a prestigious identity. Even if he's wealthy, he probably wouldn't dare to offend someone like her," someone speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree. Considering Mrs. Jenkins' status, he'll surely let it go," another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with discussions. Everyone believed that Marcus would undoubtedly hand over the Tears of the Angel to Joan as he couldn't afford to offend her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were in the heat of discussion, Marcus, however, responded firmly, "Sorry, but I also desire the Tears of the Angel, so I won't give it to anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned and hadn't anticipated Marcus to refuse so decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you concerned that I can't afford the price you desire? Don't worry, name your price. Let's be straightforward. You paid 18.88 million for the Tears of the Angel. I'll offer you ten times its original price. How about it? I believe I've demonstrated sufficient sincerity!" Joan proposed to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after offering ten times the price, Joan remained composed, as if the money held no significance for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd looked astonished and hadn't expected Joan to be so generous, directly offering ten times the original price to acquire the jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many individuals who could afford the Tears of the Angel regretted not purchasing it sooner. If they had bought it earlier, they could have instantly earned over 100 million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie looked unhappy and immediately felt a pang of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worked tirelessly at this luxury goods store every day and earned only 30 to 40 thousand dollars, while Marcus had made 100 million dollars in the blink of an eye, money she could never earn in a lifetime!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but sarcastically remark to Marcus, "You have the opportunity to make over 100 million instantly. What are you waiting for, Marcus? Agree before Mrs. Jenkins reconsiders! Even though you're wealthy now, 100 million dollars still means a lot of money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but I don't need this money. Goodbye!" Marcus didn't want to waste his time and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan furrowed her brow and blocked Marcus' path. "Don't push your luck, brat. I've already given you enough face. What else do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also furrowed his brow and replied, "Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he attempted to bypass Joan and leave the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Joan actually reached out to grab Marcus and prevent him from departing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's astonishment, Marcus slapped Joan in the face without hesitation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan screamed in pain and collapsed to the ground, wailing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What just happened shocked everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody had anticipated Marcus to dare hit Joan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was akin to suicide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was also stunned and then sneered inwardly. She quickly stepped forward to assist Joan and angrily confronted Marcus, "Marcus, how dare you assault her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jerk, do you know who Mrs. Jenkins is? You're ruined. Apologize to Mrs. Jenkins immediately, or I won't spare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan was Natalie's valuable customer, so she naturally had to defend her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Natalie disliked how Marcus had stolen her spotlight today and wanted to seize this opportunity to retaliate against him severely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you see that she attacked me first? Are you blind?" Marcus responded coldly to Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that she was merely taking advantage of the situation to disdain him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was rendered speechless and didn't want to tolerate him any longer. She instructed the nearby security guards, "This man assaulted Mrs. Jenkins. Don't let him escape. Restrain him and turn him over to the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards agreed and, knowing Joan's noble identity, instinctively sided with her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
