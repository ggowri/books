  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was Benjamin's only daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just turned 20 this year, a sophomore at Kingston University. A cheerful, </span><span>lively, and energetic girl, full of youthful vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before hitting the two-decade mark, she had lived a life of privilege, growing up with every opportunity at her fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the mayor's daughter, not only was she a top student, but she was also strikingly beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her future had once been blindingly bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, in the blink of an eye, everything changed. A sudden fainting spell during a routine physical education class. That was the first sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just been hit with the diagnosis: acute myeloid leukemia, and it was already in the final, ferocious stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The odds of beating this disease were slim to none, and now, in its vicious endgame, survival was pretty much off the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Benjamin and his wife got the news, it was like the sky came crashing down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dumbfounded. How could their daughter, with all her kindness and love, be struck down by such a cruel fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin was the mayor, but even he was powerless against the cold, unfeeling reality of disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing his daughter's grueling battle with severe leukemia, he scoured every renowned hospital in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. He even took her to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, there was no cure to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her life was sustained only by repeated blood transfusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin, buried in his responsibilities as mayor, could only rely on his wife, Lilian Mitchell, to care for their dying daughter in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of losing Grace tore at his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guilt was unbearable. He blamed himself for not spending more time with her when he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God," he cried, "I have lived honorably. I've done nothing to deserve this. Why are you punishing me? Why my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once unshakable mayor was crumbling. It was hard to imagine that this broken man was the same powerful figure who commanded respect and authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, I won't let you die. I will find a way to save you," he vowed through tears. He made call after call, reaching out to every connection he had. But the answer was always the same: there was no point in treating her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, with his daughter's condition, even the doctors said it wasn't worth the fight anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald can offer some surgical advice for Robert. Can he actually cure leukemia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flicker of hope, Benjamin thought of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Edward was an orthopedic surgeon, so Benjamin wasn't holding his breath for a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with his daughter hanging by a thread, he was down to clutching at straws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he scrambled to get in touch with Marcus, only to realize he didn't even have the guy's contact info.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin had no choice but to visit Marcus in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his position as mayor, he tracked down Marcus' address and headed straight to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had practiced through the night. The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire was nearly at the third level, just one step away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun was blazing down today, and no sooner had he reached the villa than there </span><span>was a knock echoing through the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Mr. Fitzgerald at home? I'm Benjamin Mitchell, mayor of Solomia. I've come to visit you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's voice, laced with politeness, filtered through from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, feeling surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had only met once, briefly, at the International Invitational. How had Benjamin found him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity got the better of Marcus, and he swung the door open. </span><span>There</span><span> stood Benjamin, looking haggard and worn thin, with his secretary, Amelia Morgan, by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What brings Mayor Benjamin here?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin offered a bitter smile, "I came today to ask for your help, Mr. Fitzgerald. May I speak with you further?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in," Marcus said, gesturing toward the courtyard. They stepped inside, but instead of the main house, Marcus led them to a pavilion. "What's on your mind, Mayor Benjamin? You can speak freely now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they weren't close, Marcus had a favorable impression of Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been someone he thought little of, he would've slammed the door right in their face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter's got leukemia, and the docs back in Kingston have given her three days tops. I'm at the end of my rope here, Mr. Fitzgerald. Can you save my little girl?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know your expertise is in orthopedic surgery. It's a long shot for you to tackle leukemia, but I'm fresh out of plays here. I've got just one daughter, and I can't stand to watch her go this young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can just buy her some time, even a month, I'll owe you big time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's voice cracked with excitement and pain. His heart clenched at the thought of losing his only child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which hospital is she in? What type of leukemia are we talking about?" Marcus asked, remaining calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's at Kingston Hospital," Benjamin replied immediately. "Acute myeloid leukemia, the late stages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lit a cigarette and crossed his legs. "Treatment isn't out of the question. But Kingston is quite far, and I've been buried in my own affairs lately. I'm not sure I can spare the time to travel there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus said those words, a glimmer of hope ignited in Benjamin's chest. Standing beside Benjamin, Amelia gave him a subtle wink.</span></p><div class="pagination">
