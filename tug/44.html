  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was the first to break the silence, his tone blunt and laced with condescension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles adopted a didactic tone as he spoke to Marcus, "You're just a young guy, barely in your twenties, and yet you had the nerve to show off, claiming you could treat a patient that even I couldn't handle. After this hard lesson, I hope you'll know better than to make such mistakes again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, I've successfully treated your mother. She'll wake up within the hour. You can go in and see her now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't so much as spare a glance for either Thomas or Charles. His eyes were locked on Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine was stunned, hardly believing her ears. "Marcus, you're not lying to me, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus flashed a reassuring smile and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still skeptical, Catherine wasted no time. She rushed into the operating room. As she pushed the door open and laid eyes on Laura, who looked rosy, her shock turned to awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God! My mom is really fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's cry of amazement echoed outside the operating room, reaching everyone in the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles and Thomas stood frozen. Their disbelief was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?" Charles muttered under his breath, almost to himself. "The surgery failed. There was heavy bleeding. How could she recover so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rattled by the reality in front of him, Charles hurried into the operating room with Thomas and a few of the younger nurses trailing behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw Laura lying there, looking peaceful and healthy, their jaws practically hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was healed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was saved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas stammered, "How did she recover so fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura lay on the operating table. Despite the advanced stage of her liver cancer and the recent surgical failure that led to severe hemorrhaging, she was enveloped in a deep, restful sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks glowed with a healthy flush of pink, and her breathing flowed in an even rhythm, and remarkably, the faint heartbeat that once whispered of her fragility now thumped with a newfound vigor. She seemed the picture of health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a miracle!" one of the nurses whispered in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, thank you for saving my mother. From now on, I will serve you like a loyal slave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine turned towards Marcus. With tears glistening in her eyes, she bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and helped her stand upright. "We're friends. This is nothing. Don't mention it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief and joy washed over Catherine's face. She stood on her tiptoes and kissed Marcus on the cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This tender moment, however, didn't escape Thomas's notice. His face twisted with jealousy. He had always harbored feelings for Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her kissing another man stoked a fire of resentment within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping forward aggressively, Thomas confronted Marcus with cold disdain. "Tell me, Marcus. What kind of witchcraft did you use on Mrs. Wilson? Some kind of magical cure to bring her back from the brink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored him completely, approaching Laura's bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles, meanwhile, was busy examining Laura's vitals, his mind reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After decades in the medical field, he had never witnessed anything like this. His expression was a mixture of shock and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles exclaimed, "Blood pressure's stable, heart rate's good, respiratory rate's normal. Everything's textbook! This is unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despite the blow to his pride, his admiration for the advanced medical skill on display swelled within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting another second, he urgently motioned for the nurse to bring the portable X-ray machine over. He needed to examine Laura's internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The results were staggering. Every major organ in Laura's body had returned to full, healthy function.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wounds that had once gaped and bled from the disastrous surgery had vanished as if by magic, leaving no scar behind. More astonishingly, the cancer cells that had insidiously spread through her body were now utterly gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Charles watched Laura's surgical incision being meticulously sutured, a wave of shame washed over him, a man seasoned with decades of medical experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a fool who offended you earlier. Please, don't hold it against me. I apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles was aware that the youthful figure before him, appearing scarcely out of his teens, was, in fact, a prodigious master, one whose heights he could only aspire to reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no room in his heart for jealousy or resentment toward those whose medical prowess surpassed his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was this very humility that had allowed him to rise through the ranks in Solomia's medical community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved a hand dismissively. "No need for that," he said. "We crossed paths by chance. Your words don't mean anything to me, and I never took them to heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mistaking Marcus's calm demeanor for anger, Charles grew more anxious. "If you're upset, you can punish me however you see fit. All I ask is for a bit of guidance so that I may help more patients."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, in a move that left everyone in the room speechless, Charles bowed deeply, a gesture of utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to be consumed by a deep-seated yearning for the kind of guidance only Marcus could provide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This astonishing tableau left everyone in the room utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles stood as the towering figure in Solomia's internal medicine community, a professor whose reputation preceded him wherever he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was nothing short of incredible to witness Charles, with all his accolades and prestige, bowing in deference to a young man who had barely crossed into his twenties.</span></p><div class="pagination">
