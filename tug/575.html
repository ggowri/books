  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's face twisted like he'd just bitten into a lemon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the crew he brought couldn't take Marcus down, what chance did he have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Marcus' icy stare locked onto him, making Darren's gut tighten like a vice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look here, punk," Darren barked, trying to sound tough. "Don't even think about messing with me. I'm Darren Crane, Leader of Team Tiger! You lay a finger on me, and the Axe Gang and Dragon Tiger Hall will hunt you to the ends of the earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even blink. He took one deliberate step forward, closing the distance in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus grabbed Darren's wrist, his grip like a steel trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's face twisted in pain as he flailed, trying to pull free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp motion, Marcus twisted Darren's wrist with a sickening crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren let out a scream that could've woken the dead, clutching his broken wrist as sweat dripped down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The single word hit Darren like a hammer, and his knees gave out beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared to lay a finger on my woman?" Marcus' voice was colder than a winter </span><span>wind. "Be grateful I'm only taking your arm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the recent truce between Dragon Tiger Hall and the Axe Gang, Darren Crane would already be six feet under.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abraham! Get the deputy general over here! I want this bastard torn to pieces!" Darren roared, spitting venom with every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham hesitated but nodded, his face tight with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Marcus, a smug grin on his face. "You're finished, kid. I'm calling my father, and when he gets here, you'll be begging for mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Abraham pulled out his phone and quickly dialed his father. He relayed the story, his voice dripping with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end, his father's voice erupted like a thunderstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deputy General of Dragon Tiger Hall and Darren Crane went way back, practically like brothers. Hearing Abraham's story&mdash;that some punk had the audacity to mess with his son&mdash;was enough to light a fire under him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was for Darren's pride or his own blood, Osborn knew he couldn't sit this one out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tilted his head slightly, his tone light. "So, is your call done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham smirked, crossing his arms like he was already victorious. "Oh, it's done. He'll be here in ten minutes. Enjoy your last moments of cockiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz threw up her hands, exasperated. "You've caused a disaster, and you're acting like it's nothing! Do you have any idea what you've done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, completely unfazed. "I guess I'll wait right here, then. Let's see what he thinks he can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila," Jacqueline chimed in, her face tight with worry, "this boyfriend of yours is nothing but trouble. He's gotten on Dragon Tiger Hall's bad side! Do you have any idea what that means? If you end up with him, I'll be worrying about you every single day of my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila straightened her shoulders, her voice steady. "Mom, Marcus didn't start anything. They've been goading him since the beginning. How is this his fault?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline's face flushed with </span><span>anger,</span><span> her words sharp. "A daughter always sides with her man, huh? Fine, have it your way. I won't meddle anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw her hands up and went quiet, deciding to let the chips fall where they may.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline had already said her piece. Whatever came next was out of her hands&mdash;and frankly, she couldn't bring herself to care anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barely ten minutes passed before the door burst open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man in his fifties stormed in, flanked by a group of rough-looking lackeys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than, Osborn Toynbee, the Deputy General of Dragon Tiger Hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was dark as thunderclouds as he scanned the room with predatory intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you're finally here!" Abraham rushed forward like a puppy greeting its owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's the bastard that hit Darren Crane?" Osborn growled, his voice booming like a war drum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham's finger shot toward Marcus like a dagger. "It's him! That cocky son of a bitch even claimed the Axe Gang boss bows to him! You can't let him get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborn's gaze followed Abraham's finger, zeroing in on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he saw Marcus, his entire body froze as if someone had hit the pause button. His mind went blank, and he didn't even twitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what are you waiting for?" Abraham urged, his voice pitching higher in desperation. "Crush him! Teach him what happens when you mess with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp sound of the slap echoed through the room as Osborn's hand connected with Abraham's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiot!" the man roared. "Are you trying to get me killed? You want me to go after Mr. Fitzgerald? Have you lost your damn mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham, Liz, and Jacqueline all froze, their expressions a mix of confusion and disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
