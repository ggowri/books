Each family, with just one wrong move, would be wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This constant pressure was why warriors were so desperate to improve their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by growing stronger could they survive, protect their families, and maintain their position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One elder, his cultivation at Acquired State, spoke in awe, "Who is this young man? How could his power be so... unimaginable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no idea," another elder muttered, shaking his head. "I've never seen anyone like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Either way, we must keep this information to ourselves. If it leaks, it could send shockwaves through the entire the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we certainly don't want to make an enemy of this young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he finds out we've been talking about him... our families could suffer the same fate as the Tucker family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group nodded in agreement, fully aware of the consequences of provoking someone like Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single misstep could lead to their destruction, and not just theirs, but their entire family's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the gravity of the situation, they decided to keep the truth behind the Tucker family's downfall a closely guarded secret. It would never leave this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcu took Gertie to a quiet, secluded spot at the edge of the Kinton Mountains, where the air was fresh and the scenery tranquil, with lush grasslands, dense forests, and clear rivers flowing lazily by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing that her injuries hadn't fully healed, Marcus offered, "Let me help with your wounds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Gertie had once been consumed with anger and resentment toward him, even contemplating revenge, now she didn't dare to entertain such thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that someone like Marcus, with his terrifying strength, was not someone she could defeat, no matter how much effort she put in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, after everything that had happened, Marcus was the only one who had come to her rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, she nodded obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They found a large stone to sit on, facing each other, and Marcus began channeling his Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands glowed with a soft, steady light as he pressed them gently to her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus made sure to avoid any inappropriate contact, she could still feel the strange sensation of his energy flowing into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body tingled with warmth, a feeling that spread through her sensitive areas, making her cheeks flush with a deep, unspoken heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the energy continued to pulse deeper into her, the sensation grew even more intense, leaving her feeling restless and vulnerable, as if her body was being touched in ways she couldn't control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie felt a strange pressure building in certain areas, and the sensation made her breath catch, causing her to let out a soft, involuntary sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation only grew stronger as Timeless Numinous Energy flowed deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A feeling of emptiness stirred within her, as though something was missing, something she couldn't quite place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, unable to contain herself, she asked in a quiet, slightly shaken voice, "Marcus... are you really healing me? Why does it feel so... different?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at her, unfazed. "Of course I'm healing you. What else would I be doing?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
