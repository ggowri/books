  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Fiona spoke, the people around her shot Marcus looks of contempt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To them, it seemed like Marcus was just trying to play the hero, swooping in to save Kiera and earn her affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it looked like he had chosen the wrong moment to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman he was up against today was Fiona, infamous for her temper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Fiona got mad, even her husband, Maximilian, was scared of her&mdash;let alone some young guy in his early twenties.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave Fiona a cold, mocking smile and said, "It was your husband who dragged Kiera into this mess, forcing her to drink and trying to take advantage of her. Instead of controlling your husband, you're blaming Kiera for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not just being unreasonable&mdash;you're actually enabling him to keep doing whatever he wants!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona planted her hands on her hips, her posture demanding attention as she shot him a defiant look. "I don't care about any of that. If I see this slut trying to seduce my husband, I'm going to make her pay. And what are you going to do about it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suggest you leave now, or I'll make sure you'll never show your face in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people around Fiona burst into mocking laughter at Marcus' expense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had seen guys like him a hundred times&mdash;always stepping in without thinking, trying to be the white knight. It always ended the same way: they'd end up getting crushed and begging for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus must've been one of those.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus scanned Fiona up and down before sneering. "Heh, you're the first woman I've met who's this stupid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Instead of looking at your own husband's behavior, you're putting the blame on someone else. Let me make it clear: your husband has been running around, contracting genital warts, and now he's passed it on to you. If I'm right, those bumps in your private area are spreading and driving you nuts with itching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You probably thought it was just a regular skin issue, slapping on some ointment, but nothing works. The bumps just keep multiplying&mdash;that's genital warts, and it's serious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people around Fiona went quiet, their eyes wide in shock as they exchanged uncomfortable glances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Genital warts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was a serious, contagious STD.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could Fiona </span><span>really</span><span> have it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that's true, they had all eaten with Fiona before, and some of them had even had physical contact with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought made their bodies shudder involuntarily, and they suddenly felt an uncomfortable itch creeping over their skin...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona's face twisted in disbelief as she stared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had nailed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the past couple of weeks, Fiona had noticed small red bumps, especially in her private area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They kept growing, turning into the cauliflower-like lumps of genital warts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The constant itching had driven her crazy, scratching until she bled. She had thought it was just a normal skin problem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But hearing Marcus' words, she suddenly realized what it really was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What stunned Fiona even more was how Marcus knew all of this&mdash;how he had predicted her condition and described exactly how she felt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Fiona felt completely exposed. It was as if Marcus could see right through her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was able to see through Fiona thanks to his X-ray vision and Thought Reading.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his abilities grew, so did his capacity to sense things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A simple use of his powers had revealed Fiona's condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that revelation left Kiera feeling uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just a little while ago, Maximilian had made advances toward her, too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite her best efforts to fight him off, they had still touched, and now Kiera couldn't help but wonder if she had caught the same disease.</span></p><div class="pagination">
