It was indescribably refreshing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How do you feel?" Marcus asked as he slowly withdrew the Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera, still weak, nodded slightly, her breaths still rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I feel so much better, all the previous pain is gone... You are truly amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively, draping Kiera's clothes over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at him with admiring eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's nothing. Just take better care of yourself from now on," Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's getting late, I should be going."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let me walk you out," Kiera said, beginning to dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need," Marcus waved off her offer and then left her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Marcus' departing figure, Kiera's expression flickered with complexity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He saw my most embarrassing side..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unaware of Kiera's thoughts, Marcus drove his Aston Martin towards the Mitchell Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in the male ward of Solomia Hospital, a different scene unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heath, whose male organ had been shattered by Marcus, was admitted to the intensive care unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A middle-aged man with glasses and a scholarly demeanor, along with a middle-aged woman in luxurious attire, paced anxiously outside like ants on a hot pan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A moment later, the ICU doors opened and two doctors in white coats emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged couple immediately surrounded them, the woman anxiously asking, "Doctor, how is my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctor shook his head reluctantly. "His injuries are severe. His life may be spared, but he will never regain male function again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, the couple nearly fainted, their faces turning ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are we going to do now, it's all your fault for letting our son come to Solomia alone. How is he supposed to live if he finds out about this?" the woman lamented tearfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man's expression turned ominously dark, a cold glint of vengeance flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to someone nearby and ordered, "Find out immediately who did this. No matter the cost, that person must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir!" the subordinate nodded respectfully and departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man was none other than Heath's father, Xander, a member of the Deleon family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although only a collateral member, Xander wielded considerable power and maintained excellent relations with one of the three great ancient martial arts sects, the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his son mutilated in Solomia, he was determined to exact a severe revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was oblivious to these matters as he arrived at the Mitchell Villa and, after instructing Grace in her cultivation, returned to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That evening, as he was about to enter meditation, he received a text message: [If you want this woman to live, come to the southern forest.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The message included a picture of a young girl bound and gagged. Shockingly, it was Kiera!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tidal wave of fury swept through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without further thought, he left Bayside Villa, driving his Aston Martin towards the southern forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The southern forest, located on the outskirts of Jiang City and nestled against mountains and rivers, was remote and rarely visited, its secluded nature adding to its mystery in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus parked his car at the entrance of the forest and stepped inside, a cold voice echoed from the depths. "Ha, didn't think you'd actually dare to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, torches lit up in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus realized he had been surrounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, several figures emerged from the depths of the forest, led by a scholarly-looking man with an imposing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Heath's father, Xander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
