  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion here immediately attracted the attention of other people in the sales office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they found out that it was Kevin from the Burnett family and Josie from </span><span>BioFusion</span><span> Pharmaceuticals who had a conflict, everyone immediately became interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But most people knew that even though Josie was an outstanding female entrepreneur in Kingston, she could only give way to Kevin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Burnett family was supporting Kevin, while Josie was alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the man next to Josie, no one knew him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, as the female salesperson said, that man was most likely living with Josie's support, and he was not threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, I advise you to keep your lover under control, otherwise if a conflict occurs, you will not be able to handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin also looked at Josie and sneered, with contempt in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even emphasized the word "lover".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, many people immediately laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's wife said, "I envy Ms. Shelman. As a woman, she can enjoy different men at any time. Each of them is strong. It must be very exciting, right? I never thought that the outstanding female entrepreneur in Kingston would be such a slutty bitch. It's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence was quite harsh and was an insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked grim. She didn't expect that she would be humiliated like this when buying a villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll count to three. Kneel to apologize to Ms. Shelman immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't want to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these people were going too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was his treasure. Anyone who hurt her would pay a heavy price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already started counting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one took his words seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Kevin's wife, who said with a face full of sarcasm, "Do you think you can do anything to me? You are crazy to ask me to apologize to a bitch! I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish her words, Marcus' big hand hit her like thunder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a loud snap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's wife was slapped hard and wailed in pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her teeth were broken, and blood was oozing from the corners of her mouth. She looked quite miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hit me? You're courting death. Honey, you must not let him and this bitch go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's wife cried and shouted, half of her face was swollen, and her speech became unclear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was also shocked. They never expected that Marcus would hit someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was from the Burnett family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was seeking death by beating people in public like this. If Kevin used the power of the Burnett family at will, Marcus would die miserably!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to hit my wife. You must be tired of living!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was usually arrogant and used to bullying others, when he met someone who dared to hit someone, he became a little timid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, Kevin kept moving backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the result of her taking shit. If you're unconvinced, I can also give you a few slaps!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin pointed at Marcus angrily and said, "You fucking guts, just wait for me, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Kevin called Donald and told him about his experience in the sales office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald also knew Josie. There was an event last year, and Donald liked Josie as soon as they met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been showing goodwill to Josie and promised many things as a member of the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Josie always rejected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Josie kept a gigolo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This successfully aroused Donald's anger. He wanted to see what kind of person Josie was keeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Donald found many people from the underground world and rushed to the sales office of Flourish Manor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brat, just wait for me. Mr. Burnett will be here soon. I won't let you go until I cut off one of your arms!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Kevin said to Marcus with a cold face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I want him to become a complete cripple and spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair!" Kevin's wife added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin nodded immediately and said, "Don't worry, baby. He hit you, and Mr. Burnett will not let him go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what the couple said, the onlookers all looked at Marcus and Josie with </span><span>concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt happy when beating people, but he attracted people from the Burnett family. He would end up miserably.</span></p><div class="pagination">
