  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was different from Pearl and Jane taking care of themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While that brought immense pleasure, it left them feeling empty afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But being with Marcus filled that void completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he filled them entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane soon came down from her high and began rubbing against Marcus, especially her large breasts against his body, which sent shivers down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew she wanted more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After another intense bout with Pearl, he laid Jane back on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrust into her for another half hour, finally reaching his peak in a powerful surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his newfound stamina, Marcus could easily satisfy both women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lay on the bed, breathless, momentarily lost to the world, their minds blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, exhausted, took a quick shower and sat on the sofa, lighting a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the two women stirred, the intense pleasure fading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't been with Marcus in a long time, and this time, they were thoroughly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some more tender moments with him, they left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, after breakfast, Diana pulled Marcus aside and asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, was your trip to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate smooth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus flashed a mysterious smile. "What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop playing games with me. Did you get the Return Essence Crystal or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tone was eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew just how crucial the Return Essence Crystal was to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded casually. "Got it. And not just one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes </span><span>widened,</span><span> her curiosity piqued. "How many?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty-four."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously? Twenty-four?" Diana blinked, clearly impressed. "How in the world did you manage that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered how, when she advanced to the Return Essence stage, it had been Ryan who'd given her the first crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had never been to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall herself, so she was completely unfamiliar with that region. The idea of getting one Return Essence Crystal was a major achievement in itself, but twenty-four? That was something else entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Diana's mind was racing with questions. "Wait a minute... I can't read your cultivation level. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the moment she'd seen Marcus this morning, she'd been curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he'd left for the Ice Wall, Marcus had been at the pinnacle of Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he'd made some breakthroughs, she'd expected him to have reached the peak of that stage at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Diana had assumed he'd made it to Return Essence stage, but after a closer inspection, she realized she was wrong. Something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What confused her even more was that Marcus' cultivation didn't seem to fit into any of the usual categories. He didn't seem to be at Foundation Establishment Stage, nor was he anywhere near Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was... in limbo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hidden State," Marcus replied quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The term was completely unfamiliar to her, and for a moment, she wondered if Marcus was just trying to mess with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she said, "Well then, I'd love to see just how strong this 'Hidden State' of yours really is. Be careful, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a powerful surge of magic aura surrounded Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force gathered in the palms of her hands, crackling with raw energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, she thrust her palm forward, aiming straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's cultivation was already at the peak of Demon Fighter Level Nine, just a step away from breaking into the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was far beyond Marcus in strength. Even if she wasn't going all out, there was no way Marcus could withstand an attack from someone at her level.</span></p><div class="pagination">
