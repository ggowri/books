  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, surprised to see me waiting for you here, aren't you?" Joan sneered, and the imprint of a slap was still visible on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was accompanied by dozens of armed men, with two men flanking her, each with a handgun tucked into their waistbands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had slapped her earlier in the day, and she was out for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus responded with a cold laugh, "I advise you to think twice. Otherwise, you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Joan hadn't shown up right now, he would have already forgotten about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan gave a mocking smile. "You still haven't realized </span><span>what is happening</span><span>, have you? So arrogant. Let me tell you the truth. These men are hired thugs from my husband's company. Those who offend me end up badly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to me right now and chop off the arm that hit me, and I'll let it go. Otherwise, you'll pay for what you did!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan tossed a dagger to Marcus, and her face was full of contempt and arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if worried that Marcus was at a disadvantage, Jade couldn't help but get out of the car and approach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, why are they doing this to you? I'll call the police right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade prepared to take out her phone, but Joan said, "Go ahead. Even the police can't stop me from punishing him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Jenkins, what should we do?" one of the tall men asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan said viciously, "Break his limbs and throw him into the sea to feed the fish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nodded immediately and signaled to the thugs beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs immediately swung their weapons and charged at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a voice came from not far away. "Who dares to cause trouble on our Serpent's Coil turf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's attention was drawn over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people from the underworld approached, led by a man with a menacing appearance and a long scar on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Bob from Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it's you, Bob. We're dealing with someone who offended Mrs. Jenkins. We might have to use your territory for a bit. Bob, please be understanding," the man beside Joan said, and his tone was respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Joan's husband, Lonnie Jenkins, was a famous oil tycoon in Solomia, Serpent's Coil was now the undisputed number-one gang in Solomia's underworld, controlling over 90 percent of the gray market. It was an absolute behemoth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to the gray market, Serpent's Coil had countless other businesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bars, restaurants, casinos, massage parlors, and high-end clubs were scattered throughout Solomia, bringing in tens of billions of dollars in profit each year for Serpent's Coil. With some highly profitable gray market operations, Serpent's Coil's annual profits had grown to hundreds of billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of income alone, Serpent's Coil was not inferior to Joan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an underworld gang, the main strength of Serpent's Coil was its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since becoming the number one gang in Solomia's underworld, Serpent's Coil had expanded its influence rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It now had tens of thousands of members, and each of them was a ruthless killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The core group had even trained in the magic Marcus had taught them, making Serpent's Coil several times more potent than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, even Lonnie had to show respect to the higher-ups of Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they were currently fighting on Serpent's Coil's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules of the underworld, they were infringing on the turf of Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob's gaze shifted from the tall man to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he froze, and his face turned pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs buckled, and he collapsed right in front of Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade couldn't help but look at Marcus curiously, wondering when he had become involved with Solomia's underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob was well-known in Serpent's Coil. Anyone with some knowledge of Solomia's underworld generally knew him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was definitely a tough character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here he was, prostrating himself before Marcus in front of everyone, which was simply incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing much. I was just driving by and got blocked by these people," Marcus replied casually, and every word was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob's face immediately flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up from the ground, glanced at Joan and her group, and said through gritted teeth, "You fucking dare to offend Mr. Fitzgerald! Are you courting death?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
