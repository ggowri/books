  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie couldn't understand why Marcus, who was only treating her ankle, made her feel such an embarrassing sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, tell me, was this intentional?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she had been with Marcus before, Natalie had realized that his skills were surprisingly advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that he had plenty of experience, and now, feeling this way, Natalie couldn't help but suspect that it might be related.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're overthinking," Marcus denied, "Just bear with it for a moment. It'll be fine soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus intensified the circulation of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire technique. A stronger Timeless Numinous Energy began to flow through Natalie's skin, penetrating the injured area of her ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It continuously repaired the damaged tissues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout this process, Natalie couldn't help but experience intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At some point, she reached a climax she couldn't hold back from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud, passionate cry escaped her lips, and she gasped for air, her mind going blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body also involuntarily leaked a stream of fluid, soaking through her underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt mortified, as if she could die from embarrassment and just wanted to disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you can get up and walk now," Just as Natalie was overwhelmed by both immense pleasure and a whirlwind of emotions, Marcus spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately retracted his hand and ceased the flow of Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the euphoric sensation faded, and Natalie felt a pang of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, she stood up and tentatively walked back and forth on the steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's amazing! It really doesn't hurt anymore! Marcus, when did you learn medicine? Your skills are incredible. I've never seen techniques like that before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the effect is really amazing. Most people with sprained ankles would need at least a month of rest before they could walk again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you healed mine in just over ten minutes! That's impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she marveled at how effortlessly she could walk now, her face lit up with joy and surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never imagined Marcus possessed such miraculous skills, directly healing an ankle sprain. Directly cure patients with sprained ankles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole process didn't involve any instruments or medicines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Natalie, it was something utterly beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A sprained ankle is nothing. I can cure cancer," Marcus replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was serious, but to Natalie, it seemed like he was joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew cancer was a terminal illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most powerful figures trembled at the mention of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone got cancer, their life was essentially over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie knew this better than anyone, as her grandparents had both died from cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her mother was suffering from late-stage cancer, barely able to endure the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus claimed he could cure cancer, Natalie naturally didn't believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dismissed it as a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could tell that Natalie didn't believe him, but he didn't bother explaining. He simply followed her to the entrance of her building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this good enough?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie nodded lightly, a charming smile appearing on her face. "Thank you for driving me back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus responded, "Since I promised to accompany you, I'll see it through. I don't mind the trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, who's this kid, and why did he follow you to the building entrance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a middle-aged man's voice rang out from a short distance away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instinctively turned his head and saw a disheveled middle-aged man walking towards them, reeking of alcohol. The man was holding an unfinished bottle of liquor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recognized him. This was Payne Vance, Natalie's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his memory, Natalie's parents worked for a state-owned enterprise in Solomia. While their financial situation wasn't great, they were comfortably middle class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Payne had been just a small office worker in a workshop, looking far more energetic than he was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, he seemed like a full-fledged alcoholic, resembling nothing more than the worst kind of drunkard, similar to someone like Catherine's father, Philip Wilson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, this is Marcus, my high school classmate. He's been to our house when we were kids, so you might not remember him," Natalie introduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne took another sip of his drink, his gaze blurry as he squinted at Marcus. "So, he's your high school classmate? Why did he bring you back? You two get together or something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Natalie could explain, Payne looked Marcus over and said, "Natalie, listen to me. I don't mind you finding a partner, but make sure he's wealthy. People like him, with no money, </span><span>can</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t marry into</span><span> our family. Your mom needs treatment, and your brother needs a wife. Our whole family depends on you. Got it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
