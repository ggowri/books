  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson immediately raised his hand and pointed at Marcus, declaring, "It's him! Bob, as long as you take him out, I'm willing to give you everything I own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Jenson had reached the point of desperation, determined to destroy Marcus at any cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's done for. Marcus is finished. Judging by Bob's demeanor, he's definitely going to back Jenson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, no matter how rich someone is, they still fear a blade. This is exactly why so many big shots in the business world avoid crossing the underground."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs spread among the crowd, most convinced that Marcus would either die or pay a devastating price today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie, standing on the sidelines, felt particularly unwilling to accept this turn of events. She had initially set her sights on Jenson, but he had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shifting her attention to Marcus seemed promising, but now it looked like he would also be taken down by the underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it too much to ask for her to find a rich man to rely on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Bob followed the direction of Jenson's pointed finger and locked eyes on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his expression froze, his mind going blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob! Take him down! Why aren't you moving yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Bob standing there in a daze, Jenson urged, a smug smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Marcus was already doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jenson could finish his thought, Bob swung a hand across his face, sending him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into stunned silence. Everyone froze, unable to comprehend why Bob had suddenly struck Jenson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob! Why did you hit me? You must have made a mistake! It's him you should be dealing with!" Jenson shouted, clutching his swollen face in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiot! Are you trying to get me killed? I hit you on purpose!" Bob roared, his face twisting with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, he turned to his subordinates and barked, "You lot, get over here and chop off his limbs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the men drew their knives and rushed toward Jenson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pinned Jenson to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's expression completely crumbled as he struggled desperately. "Bob, why are you doing this? What did I do wrong? Please, don't treat me like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could finish his plea, a knife flashed, followed by a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's left hand was severed, blood gushing out as he let out a blood-curdling scream. His face was pale with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob, I was wrong! Please forgive me! Don't cut anymore! Please... ahh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, another knife descended, severing his right hand. Blood splattered across the walls, filling the room with a nauseating metallic scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard of the ruthlessness of the underground world, but seeing it in person was nothing like the dramatized violence in movies or TV shows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep chopping!" Seeing that Jenson still had two legs left, Bob continued to give orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men nodded and swung their knives again, severing Jenson's legs with two more brutal strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson writhed in agony, almost passing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, enduring the excruciating pain, and with a face full of despair, he asked Bob, "Bob, I've never done anything to wrong you. Why are you chopping off my limbs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only he but everyone in the room was also dying to know the answer, their ears straining to catch Bob's reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you, Jenson, listen carefully! The man you wanted me to go after is Mr. Fitzgerald! He is someone the entire Serpent's Coil must treat with the utmost respect! One word from him could wipe out the entire Serpent's Coil. You had me go after someone like him? What the hell is wrong with you? You might as well be trying to get me killed! Not killing you and only chopping off your limbs is already a mercy. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob's words hit the crowd like a thunderclap. Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Marcus with a dull expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this be possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Marcus be connected to Serpent's Coil?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And according to Bob, Marcus held the power to decide the fate of the entire gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of status did he hold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, Vivian, Natalie, and Sean trembled at the realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suddenly thought of something Marcus had said before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said that he wasn't just the head of Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, none of them had taken it seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the weight of his words came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus truly wasn't just the head of Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the largest gang in Solomia, Serpent's Coil, answered to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bob, drenched in cold sweat, nervously approached Marcus. Bowing deeply, he stammered, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I had no idea he was targeting you. Please, forgive my ignorance!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
