  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda felt a wave of dizziness wash over her as she turned to Marcus. "Marcus, this house is way too expensive! We don't need to buy something so lavish; just having a place to stay is enough. If it comes down to it, we can always rent a place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard chimed in, nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two million dollars? They'd never seen that much money in their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew Marcus had always been concerned about pomp, but there were limits to what one could afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought that given Marcus' position within the Winchester family, it would be difficult for him to come up with such a substantial sum of money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, don't worry. 20 million is just pocket change for me now," Marcus reassured them with a confident smile before turning to Amy, the real estate agent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to buy your best villa. Prepare the contract right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy blinked in surprise; then a smirk crept onto her face. Without even looking at Marcus, she turned to her colleagues and said, "This guy must be delusional. The best villa here is worth 130 million dollars. Does he think money grows on trees?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other salespeople burst into laughter, completely disregarding their professional demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emilia Clarke, one of the female agents, clutched her stomach, laughing mockingly. "Oh, Amy, don't be so harsh! He did roll up in an Alphard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy shrugged it off, her laughter growing louder. "So what if he drove an Alphard? He could just be a driver! A real boss wouldn't be driving himself around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emilia nodded in agreement, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "You're spot on, Amy. You probably think you can impress your parents by showing off. But you're in the wrong place. We only sell villas here, not props for a show. You should just leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned, taken aback by their blatant disrespect. He hadn't expected such condescension from the sales team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll say it again: I want to buy your most expensive villa. Is anyone willing to assist me?" he insisted, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy and Emilia exchanged glances, rolling their eyes. No one wanted to entertain a guy they deemed a pretentious, broke chauffeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a gentle-looking girl named Catherine Wilson stepped out from one of the rooms, balancing freshly prepared drinks on a tray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She approached Amy and the others, placing the drinks down with a polite demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy thought for a while and said to Catherine, "Catherine, here's a big client for you. You've been here for three months without making a sale. Go ahead and take this opportunity, maybe you can earn a nice commission!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's eyes caught Marcus and his family, and she sensed that Amy was setting her up for failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine had been with the company for three months without making a single sale, with potential clients slipping through her fingers thanks to Amy and Emilia's cutthroat tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't close a deal soon, she risked losing her job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Marcus and his family, Catherine felt a twinge of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was determined to uphold her professional integrity. With a warm smile, she approached them. "Hi! I'm Catherine. How can I help you today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately took a liking to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked young, likely fresh out of college, but she exuded a refreshing warmth and professionalism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Catherine began to explain the details of the Cedars Villas community, Marcus found himself drawn in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her knowledgeable presentation, he learned that the so-called "most expensive" villa wasn't even in the prime location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was another villa priced at 80 million dollars, which was superior in every aspect&mdash;location, size, and orientation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, my presentation is complete. If you have any questions, feel free to ask," Catherine said, her warm smile lighting up her pretty face, offering a refreshing sense of ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did a fantastic job! I'm very satisfied&mdash;I'll take this villa. Let's get this transaction rolling!" Marcus replied, pulling out a card containing a staggering 10 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine took the card, momentarily stunned. "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you really serious about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I am! Just go ahead and swipe it," Marcus said, his confidence evident as he flashed a reassuring smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy snickered, unable to contain herself. "A poor chauffeur like him couldn't possibly afford 80 million dollars. Look at that card; it's not even a domestic card. It's probably just a prop he's using to play tricks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy's skepticism wasn't entirely unfounded, as Marcus' card was an international banking institution's pinnacle, a diamond card reserved for individuals with deposits exceeding five billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Amy being just a typical real estate agent, she had no clue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda, seeing the tension rise, urgently said to Marcus, "Honey, we appreciate your good intentions, but 80 million dollars is a hefty sum; how could you possibly have that kind of money? We should really go. I don't want anyone laughing at you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Amy and Emilia exchanged glances and moved over, their condescending demeanor palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy stepped back slightly, casting a disdainful look at Melinda's modest attire. "At least your mother has some sense. You should really take her advice and leave; you don't want to hold us up while we work!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda's face burned with embarrassment as she clutched Marcus' arm, whispering urgently, "Marcus, please listen to me. Let's just go and not interfere with their business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a surge of anger at their treatment of his family. "Whether I can afford this or not is my business. I don't need anyone's judgment&mdash;so back off, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was icy, and the sudden shift in his demeanor startled Amy and Emilia, who retreated to the bar in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amy, let's not waste our time with this broke chauffeur. If he can't swipe that card for 80 million, I'd love to see how he gets out of this one. The security will surely take care of him!" Emilia said defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm going to process the card right now. Please hold on," Catherine said, her heart racing as she approached the bar to activate the point-of-sale machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a few moments, the machine beeped. "Transaction completed. Eighty million dollars has been successfully charged to your account!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
