  <div class="container"><p>Aidan, with a fawning smile, took the initiative to greet Jalen.</p><p>&quot;Smack!&quot;</p><p>Before the words were finished, Jalen slapped Aidan across the face.</p><p>Since Jalen had been practicing magic, the force of this slap was far beyond what an ordinary person could endure.</p><p>Aidan was instantly knocked to the ground, letting out a miserable scream and wailing in pain.</p><p>That slap directly knocked out several of Aidan&#x27;s molars, with blood continuously gushing from his mouth.</p><p>&quot;Who do you think you are to talk to me?&quot; Jalen gave Aidan a cold glance, full of disdain.</p><p>Everyone looked surprised, not expecting Jalen to strike Aidan as soon as he arrived.</p><p>Especially Faith, whose heart couldn&#x27;t help but tremble.</p><p>Aidan held his swollen face and asked in confusion, &quot;Mr. Zafer, I admit I&#x27;m not qualified to talk to you, but at least I&#x27;m part of the underground world and have always shown you the utmost respect. Was it really necessary to hit me?&quot;</p><p>Jalen immediately got angry upon hearing this, kicked Aidan, and said coldly, &quot;Who do you think you are to call yourself part of the underground world? Do you really think you&#x27;re somebody?&quot;</p><p>Saying this, he waved to the people behind him.</p><p>Those people raised their guns, aiming at Aidan and all his subordinates.</p><p>Aidan&#x27;s subordinates had already been scared out of their wits by the earlier scene. </p><p>Now, seeing the guns pointed at them, they were even more terrified, squatting on the ground with their heads in their hands, not daring to move.</p><p>&quot;Tie this guy up and beat him hard. Don&#x27;t stop until he&#x27;s dead. And that woman, tie her up and beat her to death too!&quot; Jalen ordered his subordinates.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was shocked again. They didn&#x27;t expect Jalen to target Aidan as soon as he arrived.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Zafer, please calm down, don&#x27;t do this. Even if you want to deal with me, at least let me know why. After all, I&#x27;ve never offended you!&quot; Aidan said with a trembling voice.</p><p>Up until now, he still didn&#x27;t understand why Jalen suddenly targeted him.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s right. Mr. Zafer, we only had a conflict with that man, but we never offended you!&quot; Faith said with a tearful face.</p><p>&quot;Smack!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up! You&#x27;re not worthy to mention Mr. Fitzgerald,&quot; Jalen shouted, slapping Faith across the face, knocking out most of her teeth.</p><p>Faith screamed repeatedly in agony, unable to bear the pain. She never expected herself to face such an outcome.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Zafer, I don&#x27;t understand what you mean. Who is Mr. Fitzgerald? Someone you respect so much must be a big figure, but we really haven&#x27;t offended such a big figure!&quot; Aidan hurriedly asked.</p><p>Jalen&#x27;s face showed a trace of impatience. He said coldly, &quot;Open your eyes wide and take a good look! This is Mr. Fitzgerald, someone the entire Serpent&#x27;s Coil must treat with respect. You bunch dared to offend Mr. Fitzgerald, and today you must pay the price for it!&quot;</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, not only Aidan and Faith were stunned, but everyone present was also shocked, their faces full of disbelief.</p><p>No one expected that the Mr. Fitzgerald Jalen mentioned was actually this seemingly ordinary young man in front of them.</p><p>Just now, to take revenge on this young man, Faith specifically called Aidan.</p><p>As soon as Aidan arrived, he threatened to cut off Marcus&#x27;s limbs and rape Morgana in front of him, acting utterly arrogant.</p><p>At that time, everyone thought Marcus and Morgana probably couldn&#x27;t escape this disaster.</p><p>After all, Aidan was not only ruthless but also notorious for his perversion; anyone who offended him met a terrible fate.</p><div class="pagination">
