  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged female interviewer rushed forward to prop Leif Leonard up, her voice sharp with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snapped at the security guards, "Security! What are you waiting for? That hillbilly just attacked someone! Arrest him and call the cops, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of security smirked, clearly unimpressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been watching the scene unfold from the start and had seen enough to know the real story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Leif Leonard who swung first with a weapon," the security captain said, crossing his arms. "That gentleman over there? Just self-defense. Boys, take Leonard down and hand him over to the cops!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards wasted no time. They surged forward, quickly restraining Leif with practiced efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif struggled against their grip, his voice cracking with rage. "I'm the branch manager of Sync Group's Solomia office! Do you even know who I am? You're all fired! None of you will have jobs tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards exchanged glances, their expressions dripping with sarcasm. One even spat at Leif's face, smirking. "News flash, buddy&mdash;the one who got fired is you. Still think you're the boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, guys," one of the guards said with a laugh. "Let's get this maniac to the station. Assault with a weapon? That's an easy few years behind bars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hauled Leif off, his protests fading as he was shoved into the waiting vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all over. It's completely over. My husband's been arrested! What am I supposed to do now?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged woman crumpled to the floor, her sobs echoing through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria stood frozen, her face pale as she stared at Marcus in stunned disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man she had ridiculed as a nobody, a mere bumpkin, had dismantled her carefully cultivated network with a single phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known this was possible, she would never have dared cross Marcus or Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late for regrets now. Far too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her aunt's words echoed in her mind: everything was ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her uncle had been fired and arrested. Her hopes of joining Sync Group? Crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else in the room was just as stunned, their thoughts spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was supposed to be a routine recruitment event for Sync Group's Solomia branch had spiraled into utter chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all because Gloria had tried to use her so-called connections to put pressure on Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The result? Her uncle, Leif Leonard, had lost everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The absurdity of it all felt surreal, like something out of a bad movie, but there it was, happening in real life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Marcus' phone buzzed, cutting through the heavy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the tasks you assigned have been completed. Sync Group's new CEO is in place. Is there anything else you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy's calm voice carried over the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy had always worked behind the curtain, but in truth, he was someone Marcus had deliberately placed to keep tabs on Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since the blow-up between Marcus and Stephen's nephew, Troy had been on the scene, quietly watching and reporting back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was straightforward: Marcus didn't trust Stephen as far as he could throw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been biding his time, waiting for the right person to step in and take over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after Stephen's latest blunder, Marcus had finally hit his limit. Enough was enough&mdash;it was time to cut him loose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Send a skilled operations person to Solomia as the assistant branch manager," Marcus instructed. "I'll send over the name for the general manager shortly. Make sure everything is formalized."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Fitzgerald," Troy replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes later, the assistant branch manager and a group of senior staff emerged from the headquarters building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked directly to Marcus, bowing in respect before turning toward Catherine Wilson. In unison, they bent forward in deference. "Greetings, General Manager Wilson!" they announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's eyes widened, and she waved her hands in protest. "You've got the wrong person! I'm just here for a job interview. I'm not your manager!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant branch manager chuckled warmly. "We just received orders from HQ. As of now, you are officially the General Manager of Sync Group's Solomia branch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement sent a ripple of shock through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could believe their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine, who had just been excluded from the interview process thanks to Gloria's meddling, was now running the branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was surreal&mdash;in just thirty minutes, the tables had turned so dramatically that it felt like a fever dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine herself was in disbelief, teetering between shock and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Marcus, her eyes silently pleading for guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled at her, his tone calm and reassuring. "You're honest, hardworking, and capable&mdash;exactly what the job needs. There's no reason to hesitate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Mr. Fitzgerald," Catherine stammered, "I don't know anything about Sync Group's operations. How am I supposed to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stress," Marcus replied smoothly. "I've sent someone from Kingston who knows the ropes. They'll help you settle in. Just focus on doing your best. I'm counting on you to succeed."</span></p><div class="pagination">
