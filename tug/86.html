  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter trembled in fear, unsure of what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't speak up, I'll have no choice but to act!" Marcus said with a cold smirk, grabbing Walter's wrist, preparing to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter cried out in desperation. "I'll do it, I'll do it myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, he took the dagger, closing his eyes tightly before plunging it into his right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh..." Walter screamed in agony, the dagger sinking into his flesh, and blood poured out as his right leg's tendons were severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on!" Marcus ordered, showing no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter was drenched in sweat, fully aware that if he didn't act fast, Marcus would be even more brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no choice left, he swung the dagger again, this time slashing his left leg, cutting through the tendons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, very good. You're being obedient. Keep going!" Marcus applauded Walter, as though praising a dog for its obedience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers, unable to bear witnessing such cruelty, shut their eyes in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Walter raised the dagger again, cutting through the tendons in his left arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the verge of passing out from the pain, but he held on, managing to say through clenched teeth, "Is this enough now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded in satisfaction. "I'll leave your right hand intact, so you can survive... for now. I hope you don't dare to provoke me again, or you'll regret it more painfully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter, feeling as though he had been granted mercy, tried to leave, but just as he moved, the sound of sirens filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several police cars drove into the courtyard, and a tall, middle-aged officer in a police uniform stepped out. His features bore a strong resemblance to Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, I'm late," the officer said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Josie's older brother, Allen Shelman, the captain of the East District Criminal Police Team in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie quickly reassured him. "It's okay, Allen, Mr. Fitzgerald has already handled everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then recounted the details of the incident to Allen, who listened intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though known for his fair and just approach, hearing how Walter had bullied his sister stirred a deep sense of anger within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, Walter's actions were particularly severe: leading an underground criminal group to cause trouble at a private company while armed with weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the laws of Uswad, such actions were a serious crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter, clearly unaware of the gravity of the situation, saw the arrival of the police as his moment of salvation. A look of relief spread across his face, and he immediately shouted. "Officer! This man deliberately severed my tendons, causing grievous injury. Please, arrest him and bring him to justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Allen had a cold smile. "The person who needs arresting is you. Take him into custody!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, several police officers stepped forward and restrained Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's face turned pale with rage. "This man started the violence! Why are you arresting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Allen calmly listed Walter's crimes, saying, "You were the one provoking trouble. This man was acting in self-defense. But your charge of provocation still stands, and that's why you're under arrest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's face twisted in despair, feeling as though his world was crashing down around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Brown family of Kingston was well-known for their obsession with maintaining their family's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they may have engaged in shady dealings behind closed doors, they were meticulous about keeping their dirty work hidden from the public eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be associated with the criminal underworld so openly was a grave mistake, one that would cost Walter dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he were jailed and punished, the Browns would likely not come to his rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, I'll take him now. You should thank Mr. Fitzgerald for his help," Allen said, casting a respectful glance at Marcus before leading the officers away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter, still seething with fury, shouted. "So, you're siblings! This is personal vengeance! I'll sue you, I'll sue you both!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Walter's angry shouts faded, Josie sighed in relief and turned her gaze to Marcus, her admiration for him evident. "Mr. Fitzgerald, once again, you've helped me. I don't know how to thank you," she said, her voice softening with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reflected on the course of events, Josie realized that everything had unfolded just as Marcus had predicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he orchestrated the situation was so precise that it was almost as if he had been pulling the strings from afar. It was a level of strategy and foresight that few could match&mdash;certainly not someone of Marcus's age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie found herself growing more and more impressed by Marcus, her feelings for him only deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," she ventured cautiously. "If I may ask, are you really just an ordinary executive at Golden Group?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
