  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone was stunned. They looked at Marcus as if he were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said, "What is Marcus talking about? He is really annoying! Is he deaf? Scales has already said that he knows the HR manager of Golden Group and can help us join the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's just jealous that we can join Golden Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily sneered, and his eyes turned cold when he looked at Marcus. "Can you just shut up? Scales said that he would help my girlfriend join Golden Group. Why do you always say that? Do you really think you are the head of Golden Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people looked at Marcus with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catherine just said that I was the head of Golden Group. Didn't you believe her?" Marcus said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily snorted, "Marcus, you are dreaming. If you were the head of Golden Group, I would kneel and apologize to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catherine, why did you stay with such a person? Although you refused me, any man here is better than Marcus. He is good for nothing but a braggart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He is still dreaming that he is the head of Golden Group. It is so fucking ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily could no longer hold back his anger, his face full of sarcasm. He ridiculed both Marcus and Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales really couldn't stand Marcus anymore and spoke sarcastically, "You said you are the head of Golden Group, so prove it to us. Don't talk nonsense here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales thought, "Marcus has been against me when we got here. I don't bother to argue with him, but Marcus has gone too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone immediately echoed, "Yes, let him show himself. We want to see whether he is the head of Golden Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's easy to find it out. Just wait!" A man picked up his mobile phone and searched for Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The legal representative of Golden Group and the information of principal officers were available on the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The name of the legal representative was Michelle Smith. Marcus' name was not on the list of the executive director and supervisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man showed his phone to the others. Seeing that Marcus was not on the list, they immediately laughed, "Didn't you say you were the head of Golden Group? Why isn't your name listed here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's just bragging. Don't believe it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila, Betsy, Scales, and Baily also laughed. Betsy said, "Catherine, have you been deceived by Marcus? He lied to you that he is the head of Golden Group. If so, leave him as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine didn't know how to explain it to Betsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales sneered, "Don't take what Marcus seriously. What I said just now still counts. I can help you join Golden Group, except Marcus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't bother to explain and called Michelle, "Ask the HR manager to come to Kirkland Hotel's Room 206 to see me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was stunned. Baily asked Marcus, "Are you referring to the HR manager of Golden Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily and Scales showed sarcastic smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales said, "Are you sure the HR manager will come here to see you later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uh-huh." Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, I'll just wait and see," Scales laughed. The others also laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila said, "Honey, Marcus is just a fool. Just let him go. He is Catherine's boyfriend, and Catherine and I are old classmates. Don't make things too embarrassing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales smiled, "I'm not embarrassing him. Marcus has been bragging all along. He was the one who asked the HR manager of Golden Group to come here. We are just here to watch the fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily said, "Relax, Sheila. Marcus is putting on airs. We didn't ask him to do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila thought for a while. What Baily said made some sense. Scales did not provoke Marcus. It was just that Marcus had always been arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, will the HR manager really come?" Catherine asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, he will definitely be here in 5 minutes," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone sneered, "Let's just wait 5 minutes!" The others nodded, waiting to see Marcus make a fool of himself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
