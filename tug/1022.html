  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Natalia gasped sharply, her body suddenly overwhelmed by a deep sensation that seemed to fill the emptiness she'd been carrying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brief moment, she felt a sense of relief, but as Marcus' movements continued, that lingering feeling of being incomplete only grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of sensation spread through her, starting from her lower body and quickly enveloping her entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's body trembled, and the sounds that escaped her lips grew more desperate, her breath quickening with the intensity of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the tightening sensation also brought a sharp, overwhelming pleasure to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed her breasts while increasing the frequency of thrusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every movement, he seemed to press deeper, drawing increasingly fervent gasps from Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia shifted slightly, her legs parting involuntarily as she pulled Marcus closer, her arms wrapped around his waist, her expression one of pure enjoyment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, then whispered, "What if they come back? I'm scared... If they catch us... I wouldn't be able to face anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed softly, his tone reassuring yet teasing. "Relax, it's fine. The more nervous you are, the more exciting it becomes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's brow furrowed slightly, a playful spark in her eyes as she realized how mischievous Marcus had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she couldn't deny what he said. There was something about the hidden nature of their actions that made everything feel so much more intense than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the sensation was far more intense than anything she had felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, overwhelmed by the rush of sensations, Natalia reached her second peak, leaving the sofa damp beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the leather material kept it from soaking through, or they might have found themselves in a bit of a mess afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can feel you've gotten bigger. It's stretching me so much. I don't think I can take any more!" Natalia moaned, her voice breathy as she looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of helplessness, almost as if she were silently pleading for him to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the overwhelming sensations coursing through her, Natalia found herself unable to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want Marcus to pull away because the feeling was just too good to let go of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her first experience with Marcus, Natalia discovered a new sense of fulfillment, unlocking a deeper understanding of herself and what it meant to truly enjoy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month later, as they embraced once more, she felt both physical pleasure and a deep sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she couldn't help but feel like the luckiest woman in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Natalia reached the peak of pleasure for the third time, Marcus gently turned her around, guiding her to kneel on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This new position allowed her curves to show in the most flattering way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each motion, Marcus slapped her hips hard, and though the intensity was high, Natalia was lost in the overwhelming pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expressions, filled with satisfaction, were unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped in between moans, her voice breathy with desire, "Marcus, not just keep going. Spank me... I need it... it feels incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus and Natalia first had sex, she showed an inclination for Masochism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Marcus had reservations about using anything like that, feeling it might be disrespectful toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, their intimate moments became less focused on that over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing the pleasure on Natalia's face, Marcus started to see things in a different light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that their moments together were about mutual enjoyment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was, by all means, a normal girl with her own unique preferences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as it made her happy, that was all that mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus let go of his inhibitions, his movements became more intense, each one bringing a new wave of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of their connection echoed through the room, while Natalia's reactions showed just how much she was enjoying the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' spank, Natalia quickly reached her fourth peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, a liquid shot out from a mysterious gap, almost like a tiny fountain, drenching the ground beneath her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a big patch of water on the floor. Natalia was feeling great, totally wrapped up in this huge wave of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind blanked, and the gap seemed to contract, giving her an extraordinary sense of euphoria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' Dual Cultivation power intensified, the pleasure doubled, and she lost consciousness for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she regained awareness, she was left with a disorienting feeling, as if she had lost track of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind went blank for a moment, but after Marcus' increasingly intense thrusting, she snapped back to reality and squeezed him harder, her moans growing louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus sped up his movements, Natalia's full breasts swayed with each motion, the sight striking and hard to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Dual Cultivation power, Marcus' pleasure surged, reaching its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist any longer, he gripped Natalia's legs, pushing himself further in an intense final rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense session lasted for about half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless pace and the forceful movements left Natalia dizzy, slipping in and out of consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several cycles, Marcus finally ejaculated, filling her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Natalia felt as if every part of her was consumed by an overwhelming sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pleasure was so intense that she didn't want it to end, and a part of her wanted him to keep going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gasped for air, rolling off of her and pulling her into his arms as he gently withdrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's face was flushed, her eyes closed as she reveled in the lingering wave of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus had stopped, the aftershocks still left her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, feeling good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, Marcus lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, and asked with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia nodded eagerly, her voice a little breathless. "Marcus, it's only been a month, but you've really leveled up. I almost lost my mind there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned. "As long as you're happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed from outside the villa, making Natalia jump up from the sofa in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly threw on her clothes and grabbed a tissue to clean up the mess on the sofa and the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few hectic moments, the door to the villa opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus had gotten dressed, as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Diana, Jane, and Pearl, back from shopping, each of them carrying several bags filled with their finds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Natalia's flushed face and her startled expression, the three women exchanged looks, a knowing glance passing between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the charged atmosphere in the room, they quickly pieced together what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane couldn't resist teasing, "Natalia, you just got back and already had Marcus working overtime? You sure have a lot of energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her usual confidence, Natalia couldn't help but blush at the remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot Jane an annoyed look. "You sure talk a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane chuckled, walking over to the sofa and noticing Natalia's pink Hello Kitty underwear. A mischievous smile showed on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, the weather's not so hot anymore. Why are you still going without..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
