  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the scene unfolded, Pablo, Arabella, and the surrounding crowd exchanged smirks of disbelief and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella couldn't resist sneering, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "Look at this guy! He's really committing to the act. Honestly, his performance deserves an award&mdash;pretending to call someone important? Hilarious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Pablo, clearly amused. "Mr. Ashford, this is going to be a good show. Let's see how far he's willing to take this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo leaned </span><span>back,</span><span> his expression smug. "Exactly. There's no need to rush. Let's see what kind of so-called 'big shot' he thinks he can pull in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the call, a strong and commanding voice answered almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Julian Ashford. Who's speaking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't initially had Julian's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd only found it on the business card of the colonel who had handed him the commendation and medal a few days prior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the corner of the card, written in faint, almost imperceptible numbers, was Julian Ashford's personal line&mdash;a subtle but deliberate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone of Julian's rank and stature, such a number was undoubtedly classified and rarely shared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Julian had done this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Commander Ashford, this is Marcus Fitzgerald. We met recently in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>," Marcus began, his tone respectful yet direct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering Julian's age&mdash;nearly eighty&mdash;Marcus addressed him with the utmost respect, not only as a senior official but as an elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's the common courtesy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a brief pause before Julian's voice warmed with recognition. "Ah, Marcus! What a pleasant surprise! What's the occasion for this call? Don't tell me you've finally decided to join </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> military?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a decorated war veteran and an influential figure, Julian had always valued capable individuals, especially those with strong combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had personally trained numerous high-ranking officers for </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> military over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the assassination attempt in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, Julian had been thoroughly impressed by Marcus' extraordinary skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he returned to Kingston, Julian couldn't get the thought of recruiting Marcus out of his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the talents Marcus displayed that day, a little guidance and mentoring would easily mold him into a formidable force within the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when Julian received Marcus' call, he couldn't help but feel hopeful, thinking Marcus might finally agree to join </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> armed forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice remained steady. "Commander Ashford, I'm honored by the offer, but I haven't changed my mind about joining the military. That's not the reason for my call today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's tone grew serious, tinged with curiosity. "Oh? Then what's on your mind, Marcus? Go ahead, I'm listening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate. "It's about Director Pablo Ashford."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian paused for a moment before responding, his voice firm. "Pablo? What about him? If he's done something wrong, rest assured, Marcus, I won't tolerate it. Even if he's my son, justice comes first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Encouraged by Julian's words, Marcus began detailing everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laid out how Pablo had fabricated evidence, abused his authority, and orchestrated the wrongful arrest of Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... this son of mine has done such disgraceful things?" Julian's voice trembled, a mix of anger and disbelief seeping through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Julian still held considerable power, his advancing years had led him to delegate much of his responsibilities, leaving him unaware of Pablo's covert actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus explained that Benjamin's arrest had been carried out in secret, bypassing any oversight from Julian. It was a calculated, underhanded move designed to avoid detection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all true, Commander," Marcus affirmed. "I have evidence to back every word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on for a moment, young man. I'll be there shortly," came Julian's steady, authoritative voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally allowed himself to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was clearly a principled man, someone who wouldn't turn a blind eye to wrongdoing&mdash;even if it involved his own son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hanging up, Marcus returned to Grace's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, however, looked anything but calm. Her hands trembled slightly as she held onto Marcus, her eyes betraying her growing unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Pablo Ashford wasn't someone to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marcus had connections to the Ortega family, Pablo could still strike without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't hard to understand why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Political families wielded power that far surpassed that of business dynasties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ortega family might have Battle God Oliver, a towering figure in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> military, but that influence was limited to one arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family, on the other hand, had Julian Ashford, a senior statesman, and </span><span>several high-ranking officials in both political and military sectors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ortega family might be richer than the </span><span>Ashfords</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in terms of power, the </span><span>Ashfords</span><span> left the Ortegas in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought made Grace's anxiety rise. She clutched Marcus' arm tightly, her face pale with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, who did you call? Where's this person you're supposedly bringing in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's sneer widened as Marcus stepped closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella didn't miss her chance to pile on. "I think I overheard him pretending to call Commander Ashford. It's almost impressive how far he's willing to go. Does he really believe someone like him would know Commander Ashford?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed, shaking her head. "Honestly, Mr. Ashford, why waste time? Let's just arrest him already and put an end to this ridiculous charade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo kept his gaze fixed on Marcus, the amusement in his eyes making his intentions clear. "Let's humor him a little longer. I want to see what else he's got up his sleeve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, murmurs rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy has no clue what he's doing. Doesn't he know Commander Ashford is Pablo's father? If he's going to fake a connection, at least pick someone unrelated!" someone whispered, shaking their </span><span>heads</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously! He probably doesn't even realize the connection. People at his level wouldn't have access to that kind of information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter rippled through the </span><span>group,</span><span> their eyes filled with anticipation for the moment Marcus would be thoroughly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you sure you know Commander Ashford?" Grace whispered, her voice barely above a tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a reassuring nod. "Yes, just give it a few more minutes. He'll be here, and your father's name will be cleared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's heart swelled with cautious hope, but doubt lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Marcus truly know someone as powerful as Julian Ashford?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes ticked by slowly, and still, nothing had changed in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella's smirk grew more pronounced as she turned to Pablo. "Mr. Ashford, it's been ten minutes. If something was going to happen, it would've happened by now. He's just bluffing, like I said. Let's arrest him already and be done with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo checked the time, his expression darkening as he nodded in agreement. "Guards, take him away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A booming, commanding voice rang out from the entrance, freezing everyone in their tracks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
