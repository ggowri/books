  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She has always had an intense longing for the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's just that in Gertie's family, apart from those nine Grandmasters, no one has truly reached the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even her aunt, Minerva Leah, is merely at the peak of Level Nine Demon Fighter, unable to reach the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she actually achieved what Minerva had worked for hundreds of years to attain. This made Gertie almost unable to believe it, prompting her to use Inner Vision again to fully confirm her state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you want to reach the Return Essence stage?" Marcus asked as Gertie was lost in endless thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie immediately showed an excited expression and said, "Of course. In our family, only a few Grandmasters have reached this state of cultivation. I've been pursuing this state for so many years but have never been able to break through."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about I help you break through to the Return Essence stage now?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really?" Gertie asked, blinking with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, I never lie," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do we still need to make love?" Gertie asked shyly, as if something had crossed her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You misunderstood. Not this time... You seem a bit expectant?" Marcus said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie shyly gave Marcus a light punch and said, "I didn't. Stop talking nonsense. It just crossed my mind suddenly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said nothing and directly took out a piece of Return Essence Crystal from his Spatial Ring and handed it to Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie immediately showed a look of surprise and said, "Is this a Return Essence Crystal? Did you get this with Ada at the Morvalis Ice Wall?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled and nodded. "Yes, keep it. You'll need it later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now you can start using your best cultivation manuals to absorb the energy from the Return Essence Crystal and try to break through your cultivation, while I assist you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie nodded gently, sat down on the bed, and began using her cultivation manuals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was enveloped in an extremely bright light, making her look like a goddess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The light instantly enveloped the Return Essence Crystal and began absorbing its energy bit by bit. The energy seeped into her body through her palms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling that power, Gertie was astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The energy of the Return Essence Crystal was indeed irreplaceable by ordinary crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder those aiming to break through the Return Essence stage must rely on the Return Essence Crystal for support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Marcus also activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, using Timeless Numinous Energy to assist Gertie in breaking through the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie fully immersed herself, pushing the cultivation manuals she practiced to the limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, the Return Essence Crystal in her palm was completely refined and absorbed into her body, circulating through her energy channels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Focus and fully integrate this power into your body," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie nodded gently, focusing on operating the cultivation manuals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, the Timeless Numinous Energy transferred by Marcus merged with the energy within Gertie, assisting the Return Essence Crystal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The process was quite slow; though it appeared calm, it actually held many dangers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they were even slightly careless, they could lose their minds, leading to unimaginable consequences!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Marcus dared not be careless, focusing on operating the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to fully assist Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This process lasted about three hours. As the energy surged within Gertie, her cultivation finally reached the Return Essence stage!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the breakthrough, Gertie's aura completely transformed, becoming not only more powerful but also deeper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Foundation Establishment Stage and Return Essence Stage have an insurmountable gap, with a world of difference in strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when Gertie's cultivation reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine, her abilities couldn't compare to now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's no exaggeration to say that her current self could defeat her former self with just one move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap between the two is obvious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie took a deep breath, drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her face was extremely rosy, as if she had been intensely nourished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I finally broke through... This is amazing. Marcus, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie looked at Marcus with gratitude in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Marcus could speak, footsteps sounded from outside the courtyard.</span></p><div class="pagination">
