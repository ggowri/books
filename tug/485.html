  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rushing into uncharted territory was a gamble Marcus couldn't afford. He wouldn't even have the means to defend himself if he encountered danger. Caution was paramount when exploring the unknown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Refocusing, Marcus dragged the map's coordinates to pinpoint the region where the Cole family resided in Acoton. This family had previously gone to great lengths to eliminate him, deploying multiple experts and nearly taking Jade's life in the process. That was </span><span>something</span><span> Marcus couldn't forgive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Acoton, within a lavish hall, a group of middle-aged men sat discussing matters of grave importance. Among them was Andrew, the head of the Cole family, surrounded by the family's upper echelons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has the situation with Jordon's death in Uswad been handled?" Andrew asked, his cold gaze scanning the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An older man among the family's leadership stood up and responded, "Rest assured, Mr. Cole. I've already dispatched top experts to Uswad to eliminate the perpetrator. If all has gone as planned, that man should have met his maker by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew nodded. "Good. Anyone who dares challenge our family's authority must pay a heavy price. Let the world see what happens to those who cross the Cole family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Andrew finished speaking, the grand doors to the hall pushed open. A young man rushed in, dropping to one knee before Andrew. His voice trembled with urgency as he reported, "Mr. Cole, the team we sent to Uswad to avenge Jordon has been completely wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence fell over the room. The family leaders, particularly the man responsible for the mission, were visibly shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! How could this happen? Are you certain of this information?" the elder leader demanded, his voice tinged with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To kill this Uswadian, he had spared no expense, assembling a team that included two level four metahumans and several fourth-generation cyborgs. Such a force was nearly unstoppable, even in a place as ruthless as Acoton. The idea that they had been entirely annihilated was something he simply couldn't accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The report is absolutely true. They died in a gruesome manner, so much so that there weren't even intact bodies left. It's likely they provoked a powerful figure in Uswad," the young man said, his voice trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cole family was one of the most prominent in Acoton, wielding influence that extended far beyond what ordinary people could comprehend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jordon had been a key elder within the family, and his death in Uswad had shaken the family to its core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, once the family's upper echelons gave the order, the target's survival was as good as impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the team sent to exact vengeance had been completely annihilated. It was a shocking and unprecedented turn of events, leaving the young man struggling to process it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Andrew erupted into fury, his voice thunderous as he declared, "It doesn't matter who they are. Anyone who dares to kill a member of the Cole family must pay a heavy price! Mobilize all our connections in Uswad immediately. Find out who the culprit is, and once identified, eliminate them without mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family's senior members nodded in unison. The Cole family's reputation as a global powerhouse meant they could not allow such an affront to go unpunished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to go to all that trouble. I've come to you myself," a calm, detached voice suddenly echoed through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cole family members froze, their eyes darting around the room, searching for the source.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a brilliant light began to glow in one corner of the hall. Then, the light rapidly coalesced into a towering, handsome figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the room widened their eyes in disbelief as they stared at the young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cole family's hall was heavily fortified, shielded by some mysterious power, and guarded with meticulous precision. For someone to appear here out of thin air was beyond their comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? How did you get in here?" One of the Cole family's senior members demanded coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled faintly and mockingly as he replied nonchalantly, "I'm the one you've been so eager to track down. The killer." His words sent a wave of shock through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the family leaders quickly gestured, and in an instant, black-clad guards armed with guns flooded the hall, their weapons aimed squarely at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew rose from his chair, his gaze icy and filled with disdain as he sneered, "You bring yourself to ruin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, Andrew remained oblivious to the danger looming over him. With a sharp motion of his hand, the command was given.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards pulled their triggers, and a deafening barrage of gunfire filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets rained down on Marcus. Their intent was to leave no chance for him to walk out alive.</span></p><div class="pagination">
