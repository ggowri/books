  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Marcus was given a lot of so-called waste raw crystals, he could pick one of the best crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he stood in the center of the raw crystals and used his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the internal structure of all the raw crystals appeared in his sight without any barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without any hesitation, Marcus quickly selected ten of them within half a minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His speed stunned Cooke and Vanessa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Vanessa smirked as he seemed to know her intention and was ready to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It also indicated that he was indeed equipped with excellent skills in gambling on stones since he could tell they were all waste raw crystals at one glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was why he gave up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure it's your final decision?" Vanessa confirmed with Marcus and looked more confident than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sure." Marcus nodded faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the X-ray vision, he indeed noticed the disparity of these raw crystals between the ones in the front yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it didn't mean there was no fine crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These ten raw crystals he just selected would bring him energy crystals with five times more energy than the previous one, and it was quite a good deal to get it with ten billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, with the help of two stone cutters, the first raw crystal was cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the blue light bloomed, a strong energy fluctuation appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were at least two fist-sized energy crystals with excellent quality in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa was stunned for a second, and she said with a smile, "You surely have an outstanding skill of gambling, but I didn't expect you to have such good luck too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her opinion, this raw crystal should be the best one that Marcus could get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest nine would only bring him a miserable loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, things didn't go as she expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the stone cutters opened all the rest raw crystals, which all contained at least one fist-sized energy crystal with rather superior quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The total value of these raw crystals would reach more than a hundred billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they would still make a deal at the original price of ten billion dollars, which meant he earned another ninety billion dollars within half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Vanessa very upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though she had experienced many ups and downs in the business field, she couldn't help her curiosity and ordered those stone cutters, "Please open all the remaining raw crystals. I want to see the quality!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa even began to doubt whether her memory had gone wrong and that those raw crystals were not from a depleted mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If her suspicion was true, she would suffer perhaps the greatest loss in her life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stone cutters immediately did what she ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since there were hardly any energy crystals in the rest of the raw crystals, they finished cutting them more than 10 times faster than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than half an hour, all the ninety raw crystals were cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the empty shells of those wastes, Vanessa was completely blindsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of the ninety raw crystals, only two of them contained energy crystals the size of an egg in poor quality, which was in sharp contrast with the ten crystals Marcus just selected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the... What is going on? How is this happening?" Rubbing her eyes, Vanessa couldn't believe her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she looked at Marcus and asked, "May I ask how you managed to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chuckled, "Maybe just like what you said. I'm lucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa stamped her feet with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew he wouldn't tell her but couldn't do anything with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't put forward any conditions to her, and she made all the rules from the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she couldn't make him tell her the secret behind his success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition to Vanessa, Cooke and the stone cutters were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've never seen something like this in my entire career! You're a genius, young man!" One of the stone cutters gave him a thumbs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also responded to him with a smile and a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're amazing! I can't admire you more!" Cooke said with a trembling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If people thought Marcus merely depended on his luck to gain a raw crystal worth twenty billion dollars with sixty million dollars, they would know that it had nothing to do with luck now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He accurately picked the only ten raw crystals with superior quality out of all these wastes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His accuracy reached one hundred percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He might be the first one to have such prowess at gambling on stones in Southern Market ever!</span></p><div class="pagination">
