  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina thought, "Catherine is so young, not even twenty-five years old. There's no way she could be the general manager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't strange that Gina looked down upon Catherine. After all, except for the children from top noble families who would inherit their family business, it was simply impossible for Catherine to become the general manager at such a young age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Wilson wasn't lying. She is indeed the general manager at the branch of the Sync Group in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a tall and elegant professional woman walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the assistant that Marcus had specially transferred for Catherine from Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what the woman said, Gina was immediately stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, are you truly the general manager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina asked, her voice quivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. I never lie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded with a smile again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina's heart was thumping wildly. She had never envisioned that her cousin would be her immediate supervisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no wonder Catherine had mentioned the day before that her annual salary was already around ten million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Gina didn't believe a word of what Catherine had told her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Gina thought about it, she realized that Catherine was probably being overly modest when she said that she could get ten million dollars a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the general manager at the branch of the Sync Group, if all kinds of welfare bonuses were included, Catherine's annual salary might reach over fifteen million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a salary was not much less than the health product industry under their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Catherine didn't need to invest any cost, so she didn't bear any risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was simply no comparison between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina felt it was ridiculous that she had always wanted to help Catherine find a better job before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even boasted that once she got acquainted with the company, she would take good care of Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, thinking back on it, Gina couldn't help but blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Gina hadn't intended to mock Catherine, she at least felt deeply embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina suddenly recalled what Catherine had previously said about the job Marcus had found for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of person would be the one who could easily make Catherine the general manager at a branch of the Sync Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought sent another jolt of shock through Gina's heart, and she couldn't help asking Catherine continuously, "Catherine, you mentioned before that Marcus got you a job. So, who exactly is Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked this purely out of curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He owns the Golden Group in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, and it seems the Sync Group also belongs to him. I'm not sure if he has other enterprises," Catherine responded nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, after Catherine's brief answer, it was as if thunder had crashed inside Gina's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Golden Group and the Sync Group were large and listed companies with a market capitalization exceeding a hundred billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both companies were surprisingly belonged to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Catherine had said that Marcus' bank card was a Supreme Card, and only those with deposits over a hundred billion dollars were qualified to possess one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Gina had thought Catherine was spouting nonsense and had even mistaken Marcus' card for a credit card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Gina realized how narrow-minded and downright foolish her thoughts had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, what are you standing there for? Come over here, and I'll sign for you," Catherine reminded Gina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Gina come to her senses. She walked up to Catherine and handed the entry application form to Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately became respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, you look so nervous. There's no need to be like this. Even if you weren't my cousin, there's no hierarchy in our company, and everyone is treated equally," Catherine said with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina remained somewhat reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in Gina's eyes, Catherine was no longer just her cousin but her commanding superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only now that Gina grasped a profound truth. One should never underestimate anyone, including those who would seem utterly feeble in one's perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone would have infinite possibilities as long as they were living in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An unforeseen opportunity could transform someone once regarded as worthless in your eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Celestial Arc Order ranked among the three ancient martial art sects in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, situated in a mysterious enclave within the holy </span><span>Kinton</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Encircled by forbidden formations, this region appears as nothing but vast and lifeless snow-capped mountains from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, inside it hid an ancient sect that had been passed down for thousands of years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in the main hall of the Celestial Arc Order, the leader, Millet Spacey, sat erect in the principal seat, donned in a resplendent golden frock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those standing beside him were the high-ranking figures of the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At present, they all wore solemn expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elder of the Celestial Arc Order stepped forward and said, "Mr. Spacey, our Celestial Arc Order was commissioned by Mr. Roger Gellar to assist the Dragon Tiger Hall in Kingston in eradicating the underground world there. However, we were thwarted by someone, and one of our elders at the Ancient Martial Stage Five was killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This incident has seriously affected the prestige of the Celestial Arc Order in the world of Ancient Martial Art in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, and we haven't even completed Mr. Roger Gellar's mandate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest that the experts kill the murderer as a show of force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet frowned. He was on the verge of speaking when another elder, Ivan Raimi, said, "Mr. Spacey, we can't do that!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
