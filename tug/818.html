  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia looked at Grace with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Grace didn't speak and continued to stare at her with strange eyes, Kenia spoke again, "What are you looking at? I'm only saying this because we're classmates. Otherwise, I wouldn't care about you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Opportunity </span><span>rarely come twice</span><span>. I hope you cherish it. If not, you'll end up meeting your father in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace stared at Kenia. For a moment, she didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she finally spoke, "Please leave. I don't want to be disturbed by ignorant people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Kenia and Nash were stunned. Even the crowd around them froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that Grace would dare speak to Kenia like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Kenia and Nash, Nash's father was a military commander, and he was about to work closely with the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such people were beyond Grace's reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Grace had dared to speak so rudely to Kenia. This was a suicidal move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia lost her temper. She shouted, "Grace, you ungrateful little thing. I'm only trying to help you as a classmate. Since you're so ungrateful, don't blame me for being rude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Nash and said, "Nash, these two are pretending to be Special Advisors. If we capture them first, the Special Advisor might reward you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, Grace and Marcus were insignificant. Whether to capture them or not was just a matter of his choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a top-ranking military officer, Nash was confident in his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a step forward, scanning Grace and Marcus with a disdainful look. "You two are pretending to be Special </span><span>Advisors</span><span>. Your crime is unforgivable. Today, I, representing the Special Advisor, officially arrest you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand shot toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His move was swift and violent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd trembled. It was clear that Nash was a trained fighter with immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Grace and Marcus were in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were captured and sent to a military court, it wouldn't just be a few years </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their entire lives could be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia grinned, eagerly waiting for Nash to capture Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But against Nash's strong hand, Marcus stood still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Grace who acted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slapped Nash across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash, at least 6 feet tall with muscles, was stunned. Grace, only about 5.4 feet, looked fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet that slap sent Nash flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He screamed as his body spun in midair before crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teeth shattered, blood pouring from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected Grace, who seemed delicate, to strike with such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more shocking was that some people who had recorded the scene realized that although Grace's slap appeared soft and weak, the impact on Nash was completely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia's face turned pale in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "Grace, you slut, how dare you slap Nash? Do you want to die? He is a soldier, a subordinate of the Special Advisor. You've crossed the line. This won't end well for you. Just wait to spend the rest of your life in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash struggled to stand up, clutching his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, gritting his teeth, and said to Grace, "You slut, how dare you sneak attack me? Tell me, what kind of power did you use? Why was your slap so strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash didn't know that Grace was already an expert in Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was at a different level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Nash practiced combat skills regularly, his strength was far inferior to that of an expert of Ancient Martial Stage One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, being at Ancient Martial Stage Two, could easily deal with someone like Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This slap was a reflex born out of her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect it to be so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Nash was knocked away, Grace stared at her hands in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Marcus had introduced her to the world of Ancient Martial Art, she had been practicing. She had reached Ancient Martial Stage Two but had never fought anyone before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she proved her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked weak, but her casual slap was incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nash, don't waste words with her," Kenia said. "She just caught you off guard. You need to teach her a lesson now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia kept provoking him. She wanted to see Grace beaten by Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia didn't understand the difference between warriors and ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought like an ordinary person. Everyone knew men were naturally stronger than women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman of the same size would struggle to beat a man of the same size, let alone Nash, who weighed at least twice as much as Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being hit by a woman in public was embarrassing for Nash. His fighting spirit was fully ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth. "You bitch! You dared to sneak attack me. Now I'll show you what happens when you hit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved to attack Grace again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had never fought before. Even though she was always an expert in Ancient Martial Stage Two, she was still nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked Marcus for help. "Mr. Fitzgerald, he's attacking me again. What should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Just fight back casually. You don't need any techniques. He can't beat you. Trust me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash's fist was already coming down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch was powerful. If it hit a force meter, it would register at least 800 pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This force was like a strike from a professional fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fist Ray quickly approached Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace screamed in fear. She closed her eyes and instinctively slapped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud sound echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash screamed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His large body was sent flying again. This time, it seemed even worse than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body spun in the air and crashed into the restaurant wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wall shook from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nash hit the ground, half of his face was swollen and bruised. He looked nothing like he did before.</span></p><div class="pagination">
