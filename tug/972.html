  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Marcus's words, the crowd was both surprised and scornful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They concluded that despite Marcus's power and unusual standing, he couldn't possibly stand up to Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They agreed with Dexter that once Hank and his team arrived, Marcus would likely face a harsh consequence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around ten minutes later, a group of people entered from the hallway below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all wearing suits, exuding a powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person at the front, an elderly man with graying hair, was especially imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mere presence seemed to bring an intense sense of pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was none other than Hank, the City Governor of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter's face lit up with joy when he saw Hank. He scrambled over and complained, "Hank, you're finally here. If you had been a bit late, I'd probably have been arrested by Lloyd!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank kept his hands clasped behind his back, his gaze fixed on Dustin as he asked seriously, "Dustin, I hear you plan to arrest my cousin. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by Hank's imposing presence, Dustin trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, he gathered his courage and answered, "Dexter Gibson is guilty of corruption and bribery, a serious violation of discipline. Mayor Benjamin has issued a direct order for me to assist the Department of Justice in bringing him in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank furrowed his brows and said, "My health hasn't been great, so Benjamin's been managing things in Solomia. But it seems he's gotten a bit too full of himself. He's using his power to go after my cousin. He has messed with the wrong person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unlock those handcuffs immediately. Go back and tell Benjamin that he has no authority over my cousin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were delivered with such finality that the atmosphere in the room became palpably tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The neighbors were terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have imagined that what started as a simple landlord-tenant dispute had escalated to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the City Governor had been involved. It was almost unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people believed that Hank's arrival meant the matter was close to being resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only would Dexter avoid punishment, but with Hank's backing today, his illegal actions would only intensify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, Kiera, and Dustin would likely suffer under Hank's influence&mdash;they'd undoubtedly be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin looked grim. He never expected that Hank would override the law with such an aggressive demand to release Dexter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his position, Hank had every right to give orders to the criminal police chief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin found himself caught in another dilemma, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Marcus's voice cut through the tension. He stated, "He's guilty of corruption, neglecting his duties, abusing his power, accepting bribes, and aiding criminals. The evidence is irrefutable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you hold a prominent position, you have no right to interfere with the police, unless, of course, you want to be charged with abuse of power as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank's gaze fell on Marcus. After sizing him up, he asked, "And who are you? How dare you involve yourself in my business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter quickly explained Marcus's identity to Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank's face darkened further. "So, you're the one who hit my cousin-in-law and made a big fuss about it. Do you realize what kind of crime you're committing by involving yourself in a government official's affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't interested in wasting time on Hank's arrogant talk and continued with an icy tone, "Cut the nonsense. Do you think that just because you're the City Governor, you can do whatever you want in Solomia? This is Uswad's land, and everyone must obey the law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dexter's crimes are well-documented. If you want to interfere, you're the one guilty of abusing your power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank sneered, "Kid, you really don't know what you're up against. Even if I abuse my power, what does it matter? I'm the City Governor of Solomia. Do you honestly think you have the power to do anything to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been years since Hank had seen a young man this self-righteous, and he was going to make sure he learned a lesson.</span></p><div class="pagination">
