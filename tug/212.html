  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ruth, what do you mean by that?" Shaun's voice was icy as he questioned her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected that, at such a critical moment, Ruth would shift all the blame onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't mean anything. I'm just speaking the truth," Ruth replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun didn't want to argue with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, the situation in the room was completely under Marcus' control. Even if Shaun stayed, he wouldn't gain anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Matthew and said, "I never anticipated something like this happening to the Burnett family. Sir Burnett, I'll take my leave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Shaun stepped toward Malcolm, lowered his voice, and added, "The plan failed. I'll be interested to see how you explain this to Mr. Roger Gellar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Shaun turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun had come to the Burnett Villa to propose to Maxine, sure that he would win her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Marcus he had once looked down upon was now the one calling the shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Marcus, even Shaun couldn't help but fade into the background, leaving disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm trembled when he heard Shaun's words. Taking control of the Burnett family was not just his personal wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Roger's command, and now that he had failed, he knew he would face severe punishment from Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm had heard enough about Roger's brutal methods. Just thinking about them made him shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat appeared on Malcolm's forehead as he started planning his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't stop Shaun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he couldn't, but rather, he couldn't be bothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the eyes of others, Shaun was the high-and-mighty young master of the Whitman family, but to Marcus, he was nothing more than a clown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Shaun had never directly clashed with him, and Marcus would never have let him off so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, this disaster has struck my family because of my incompetence. Fortunately, </span><span>you've saved us from the brink of collapse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You truly are the Burnett family's savior. I can't thank you enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the situation was settled, Matthew excitedly approached Marcus, bowing deeply in gratitude, his worn face full of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, the other members of the Burnett family also bowed to Marcus, expressing their thanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The miraculous abilities Marcus had displayed had completely won their admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine looked at Marcus, her eyes shining with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, she had been worried about dragging Marcus into this mess. But now, Marcus had single-handedly resolved the Burnett family's crisis, time and time again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength surpassed all her expectations, and her gaze toward him was filled with even more awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus helped Matthew back to his feet and turned to Owen. "They are your family, Owen. It's not my place to deal with them. I'll leave them to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen nodded gratefully and immediately gave orders. "Take these traitors into custody and leave them for the police to handle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm had far too many crimes to his name, and for years, Owen had turned a blind eye to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, given how Malcolm had acted toward him, Owen wasn't inclined to show mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm, Hazel, and Arnold felt as though the sky had fallen on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were immediately restrained by the black-clad men. As they passed by Marcus, Malcolm, with a face full of unwillingness, muttered, "I'm with Mr. Roger Gellar. Just wait. Mr. Roger Gellar won't let you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they were dragged away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus furrowed his brow, somewhat surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that Malcolm was also connected to his second brother, whom he had never met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Roger's influence had already spread throughout most of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Burnett family, one of the four great families, hadn't been spared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What seemed like Marcus helping the Burnett family resolve their crisis was actually just another round of conflict with Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this, Roger would likely send even more forces to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> to suppress him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't afraid. In fact, he had already prepared himself for the worst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt rather than waste time worrying, it would be better to use that time to continue cultivating and raising his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, we were wrong about you before. Please don't hold it against us. As for your relationship with Maxine, we have no objections. When you two decide to marry, it's entirely up to you; we won't interfere," Hazel said, walking toward Marcus with a look of genuine apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella crossed her arms, also eyeing Marcus with a newfound respect. It was only then that she realized he was actually quite handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he have striking features, but he also exuded a strong, masculine aura. Standing at 6.3 feet tall, with a muscular build, he looked every bit the part of a male model.</span></p><div class="pagination">
