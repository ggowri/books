  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus laid eyes on the familiar figure, he recognized it was his adoptive father, Richard Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard turned at the voice, squinting in the moonlight to make out the man standing before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice wavered slightly as he asked, "Marcus, is that really you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard and his family lived hundreds of miles away in a remote mountain, far from the bustling Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bad roads made visits rare. Especially in the last three years, ever since he married into the Winchester family, he'd been under the strict watch of Abigail. He couldn't see his family at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, standing face-to-face with Richard, all those years of separation melted away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rushed forward in joy to grab Richard's rough hands. "Dad, it's me. I'm Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three years had aged Richard. His temples were now streaked with white, and the wrinkles on his face had deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' heart ached at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane said you'd be coming tomorrow. Why the rush? These mountain roads are dangerous at night!" His voice carried a note of urgency mixed with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned inside, calling out, "Melinda! Nicole! Be quick, Marcus is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard's wife, Melinda Fitzgerald, and his daughter, Nicole Fitzgerald, rushed out, faces glowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda was aged as well, yet her kindness remained the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Nicole was now a graceful young lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their joy lit up the night, the air was electric with their reunion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Marcus, it felt like warmth after endless winter. Finally, he'd made it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nick, it's getting cold. Don't leave him out here!" Melinda scolded, shooting her husband a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard puffed his pipe, slapping his leg in realization. "Look at my poor memory! Marcus, come in! Don't stand out here any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus followed Richard into the villa, Melinda began fussing about cooking him a big meal, even though Marcus had just eaten steak and wasn't hungry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet all he wanted was to sit and enjoy the company of his adoptive family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, Jane's been quite good to us. Your sister's got into a university in Solomia, we were worried sick about her being alone, so we came along to keep her company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As soon as we set foot in Solomia, Jane set us up in this incredible house. It's like a palace - we owe her big time. You've really need to thank her for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda's praise was genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a breath he didn't know he was holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seems like Jane was telling the truth, she didn't mess with my adoptive family at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She's smart not to do that, otherwise, I won't let her off so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But hearing them talk about Jane's good is fucking weird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, no matter how nice this house is, it's not ours. Tomorrow, I will take you to pick out a place of your own. You guys can settle down here in Solomia, and we can see each other whenever we want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's amazing! We'll have our own home in Solomia!" Nicole exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as a college freshman, Nicole was still such a kid at heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the epitome of vitality, her laughter echoing with the carefree essence of youth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled as she bounced around like a puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Girl, calm down," Melinda laughed. "You're too old for that nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Marcus, she lowered her voice. "Marcus, we know you've had it rough. Don't worry about buying us a place. We've got some savings. If we're cramping your style, we can just find ourselves a rental."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, even with his rich marriage, Marcus always seemed weighed down in that fancy world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want to add to his burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard nodded. "Yeah, that's it. Just knowing you care about us means everything. We're used to our old place. We can adapt anywhere. No need for us to take up space in some grand house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, everything's different now," Marcus said firmly. "Abigail and I are done. I'm free from that family, and I'm not the same guy anymore. I can afford to get you a nice place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Bayside's real estate prices would make most people's jaws drop, the luxury villas' price tags barely registered as a concern for Marcus anymore. Money was no longer an issue for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Richard and Melinda caught wind of the divorce, they freaked in shock. They rushed to Marcus, their questions spilling out in a flurry of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just blushed, dodging the details. "Don't worry, I'm killing it now," he grinned. "Let's go house hunting tomorrow, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple exchanged skeptical looks, yet the warmth of Marcus' offer finally melted their reservations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mix of doubt and gratitude, they nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some warm family chat and laughs, they settled on meeting at one o'clock the following afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything done, Marcus hopped in his car and took off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Anthony, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">While you enjoy yourself in the Mountaintop Villa District, you sent some killer to take my life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Nice try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now, you need to pay for your silly decision!</span></p><div class="pagination">
