  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had always thought his hands were large for a man his height, yet they couldn't fully encase Melina's bosom, a testament to her voluptuousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, don't... Didn't you say we were going to the hotel tonight?" Melina played along, her voice a mix of protest and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It doesn't mean we can't start in the car," Marcus chuckled, his laughter light and teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their movements intensified, the faint floral scent on Melina grew more pronounced, and with it, Marcus' arousal surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Innate Enchanting Physique was indeed a rare gem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No other woman could stir such a fierce desire in Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though his encounters with Melina were few and their emotional bond limited, his craving for her body was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Marcus captured Melina's neck with his lips. Melina, itching with anticipation, let out enticing moans as her hands roamed across Marcus' back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Innate Enchanting Physique not only had a potent allure for the opposite sex, but when unleashed, it also plunged her into a whirlpool of unending desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus lifted Melina's skirt, revealing the smooth skin of her chest, her full breasts quivering slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her nipples turned hard and pink, and her entire body flushed with heightened arousal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't resist taking a taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina let out a sharp cry and her body trembled incessantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus spread her legs and delved a hand into the warm, slick, mysterious territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having been prepared by Marcus before, the path was smoother than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His finger slid in with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The softness within it pulsed and contracted. The long-forgotten sensation of being enveloped drove Marcus to quicken his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus... Stop teasing... I can't take it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina whimpered, her gaze on Marcus filled with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense stimulation from below filled her with a deep craving. She felt an emptiness that needed to be filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus withdrew his fingers, now damp, and inhaled deeply. The floral scent invaded his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So embarrassing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus' rapture, Melina was mortified, wanting to hide her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus didn't give her the chance to speak, thrusting into her without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina let out a high-pitched moan. Though not her first time, she still felt tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The long-lost sensation of fullness stimulated every sensitive nerve in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina quickly reached her first peak, her lower body convulsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, Marcus nearly lost control. Melina's tightness, especially the force of her climax, seemed more intense than any other girl's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held back and began a rhythmic thrusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina, still as shy as the first time, dared not cry out loud and covered her mouth with her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus could tell she was savoring the pleasure, lost in endless desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The confined space of the car limited their positions, and they only managed to change three times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet under Marcus' fierce onslaught, Melina still climaxed thrice, savoring the ultimate pleasure each time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus... you promised. You're such a pervert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina's cheeks were flushed as she looked at Marcus with affectionate reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You enjoyed it too, didn't you? Now you're blaming me. You're being hypocritical," Marcus teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't... don't make things up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina's face turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? Then who was it that mumbled 'so good' and 'harder'? Was it a ghost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not talking to you anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina's cheeks were as red as overripe apples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was already 6:20 PM. Marcus had been with her for an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina hastily took out her makeup from her bag to touch up while Marcus started the car and headed towards the Solomia Imperial Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was rush hour, and traffic was heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite Marcus' good driving skills, he couldn't make the car fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, they arrived at the hotel's parking lot only at 7 PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hurriedly got out of the car and rushed to the elevator. By the time they reached the banquet hall, it was already 7:05.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bidding event had already begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry we're late," Melina apologized to the host.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The host frowned and asked, "Which company do you represent?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
