  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald!" Raphael, Nadia, Susan, Elliott, and the others exchanged shocked glances at the scene before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that, in this moment of crisis, Marcus would effortlessly neutralize Micah's most powerful attack with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such strength surpassed their expectations, particularly for Raphael, who felt the full brunt of the opponent's destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn't match Micah's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus casually unleashed a wave of destruction that obliterated the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of terrifying strength was this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can step back. I'll handle this," Marcus told Raphael, unfazed by the group's astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Raphael a moment to recover from his shock. He said with a worried look, "Mr. Fitzgerald, this opponent is incredibly strong. Let me assist you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feared Marcus' power was a fleeting, treasure-assisted fluke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were the case, Marcus might not withstand Micah's next assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael would rather face death than see Marcus harmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a minor threat. I can manage. You should go protect Nadia and Susan!" Marcus insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Raphael nodded, though anxiety gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Marcus seems roughly the same age as Susan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can someone so young control such power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Micah is a seasoned ancient being with strong blood ties to the brutal Shark Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can Marcus truly contend with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others in the Nuer Tribe shared Raphael's skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite intercepting Micah's surprise strike, they believed Marcus would stand no chance in a direct confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah regarded Marcus with a sneer. "I never imagined a human would attempt to save the Nuer Tribe. How absurd! Are you really ready to face death at such a young age?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus met Micah's gaze with a calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found little interest in fighting someone merely at the peak of the Ancient Martial Stage Eight, an opponent weaker than the five undersea beasts he had encountered before arriving at the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those beasts were also from the Shark Tribe, their status would certainly be above Micah's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast's rank was higher than the chief. The Shark Tribe seemed somewhat otherworldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap and make your move. You get one chance. If you don't appreciate it, you won't get another in this life!" Marcus said coldly, smiling at Micah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words came off as arrogant to the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah's expression hardened, and then he smirked contemptuously. "I don't understand why a mere human would be so bold in front of me. Is it just because you stopped one of my attacks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me clarify: I only used eighty percent of my strength for that attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Micah unleashed a far more terrifying aura than during his fight with Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd trembled at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stage Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Micah has actually reached Stage Nine! That's incredibly strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized Micah's earlier claim was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he said, he did not use his full strength in the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was at this moment that he fully revealed his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed more like he was teasing Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nuer Tribe members grew grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Micah now at Stage Nine, he was at least twice as powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Marcus truly stand against him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as he watched Micah release his full strength, Marcus remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hovering in the air, he said, "I'll say it again. You have three seconds. If you don't act, you won't get another chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah's expression hardened, fury bubbling up. "Lowly human, if you're so eager for death, I'll oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Micah fully unleashed his Stage Nine power, launching a devastating attack at Marcus that was three times stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Destructive force filled the square, and terrifying coercion descended, suffocating the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Micah had unleashed such power earlier, Raphael wouldn't have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Marcus survive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is interesting, but still not enough," Marcus replied indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Micah's attack descended, Marcus launched a seemingly ordinary Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch seemed extremely ordinary as if it had no power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would have thought how powerful this punch would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two forces collided with a soft rumble, unleashing chaotic destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah smirked mockingly. "With an attack like that, you dare to challenge me? You're delusional!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intensified his attack, aiming to obliterate Marcus in one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could react, an indescribable destructive force erupted from Marcus' Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it engulfed Micah's attack entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah froze, panic rising within him, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' seemingly weak Fist Ray carried an unstoppable destructive force that struck him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying sound echoed as Micah screamed in agony, his body thrown back like a cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed through several castles before hitting the ground, shattering the stone pavement, spitting blood, and paling in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one punch, the once-arrogant Micah was stripped of his cultivation</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span>rendered</span><span> a mere invalid.</span></p><div class="pagination">
