  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ethan sneered, "I just don't get it. You've been disqualified from the tender. Why are you still putting on airs? Who did you call? Is that call going to reinstate your tender qualifications?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the most formidable group company in this tender, Rivera Construction Group fueled Ethan's arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of Rivera Construction Group also looked highly smug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ethan spoke, many people laughed sarcastically, all thinking Marcus was just pretending to be important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From Marcus' attire, he seemed like Melina's lackey. If she was out of options, what could he possibly do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think it's hard to regain my tender qualifications?" Marcus retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He despised people who looked down on others the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, since he and Melina arrived at the tender, they had never interacted with Ethan, yet Ethan kept provoking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ethan had already pushed Marcus to his limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't act like you have the power to restore your qualifications. It's just ridiculous!" Ethan mocked even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was almost certain that Marcus was all talk and no action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't give him another glance. He said to Melina, "Melina, come with me. Let me help you win the tender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Marcus took Melina's soft hand and walked straight towards the center under everyone's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What nerve this guy has. Didn't they get disqualified? Why are they coming in?" someone questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people nodded, casting sarcastic looks at Marcus and Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina also said in confusion, "Marcus, it's nothing to be disqualified. The competition is too tough. I didn't have high hopes for this tender anyway. I came to Solomia mainly to see you. Let's leave first. Staying here is a waste of time and just makes us upset."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, smiled at Melina, "Don't worry. With me here, the contractor for Bayside Amusement Park will only be the Flourish Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you hear this guy? He's been disqualified and still says he can win the bid. It's just too laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ethan laughed mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others also wore faces of ridicule, not knowing what Marcus was up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Emma actually said to Ethan, "It's just some small-time company. You don't need to waste your breath on them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person from Rivera Construction Group immediately said respectfully, "Yes, Ms. Rivera. We, Rivera Construction Group, are the most powerful contractors here. We really don't need to argue with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't bother with the snide remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He and Melina had already arrived at the Golden Group's table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle had informed a few representatives of Golden Group, so although they didn't know Marcus, they were quite polite and directly offered the main seat to Marcus and Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene surprised everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Rivera Construction Group was the most potent contractor present, everyone understood that as a top local company in Solomia, Golden Group was also a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was precisely because Golden Group had withdrawn from the tender early on that Rivera Construction Group had become the dominant player.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you guys making a mistake? They are from the Flourish Group. How can they sit at Golden Group's spot? Be careful not to be deceived by them!" Ethan said with some reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would rather see Marcus and Melina leave after being disqualified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Mr. Fitzgerald. Please watch your words! Our chairman personally instructed Mr. Fitzgerald to support us. On behalf of Golden Group, I announce our re-entry into this bidding process!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The representative of Golden Group glanced coldly at Ethan, his words blunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His last sentence caused an uproar in the entire venue!</span></p><div class="pagination">
