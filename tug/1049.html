  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How'd you not watch your step?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked Chloe, his voice low but teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe wanted to crawl into a hole and die. Right then, she was fully wrapped in Marcus' arms, one of his big hands resting on her stomach, the other shamelessly cupping half her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart slammed against her ribs like a drumline gone rogue. She bolted upright, brushed her hair back into place, and blurted, "How'd the floor get so slick suddenly? I didn't smash into you, did I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned, shaking his head. "I'm good." Inside, though, he was smirking to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keep tumbling like that, and I'll get a handful of the other side next time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Chloe's little spill, Marcus had scored a feel of her perky, standout curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he'd figured&mdash;full, generous, and way more than her slim frame suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a wild contrast, like with Gertie, another girl he'd known. Both women were rail-thin everywhere else but stacked up top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe knew exactly where Marcus' hand had landed. Her cheeks flared redder than a traffic light, and she couldn't even look him in the eye anymore. "Good thing you're okay," she mumbled, scrambling for an out. "I'll, uh, grab you another coffee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started to bolt, but Marcus snagged her wrist and tugged her onto the couch beside him. "Forget it. Stay here with me. I already had a cup earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His warm grip sent a jolt through her. Chloe's pulse raced, her breath hitching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to wiggle her hand free, but Marcus held on tight, leaving her no choice but to sit there, trapped in his hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your hands are freezing," he said, frowning a little. Her fingers felt like ice cubes, a faint chill seeping into his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe ducked her head, her face still flushed. "Girls get cold hands sometimes. Didn't you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I've heard that," Marcus said, "but yours are next-level chilly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shrugged, voice quiet. "Guess it's from when my mom was pregnant with me. We didn't have much&mdash;barely kept the heat on, and food was scarce. Left me with a weak constitution and cold hands ever since."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh," Marcus said, nodding. Touching her, he could sense it&mdash;a deep, stubborn chill running through her core. "You know, I might actually have a fix for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's brows shot up. "What, you're a doctor now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something like that," he said with a half-smile. "With how cold you run, does it hit you hard when your period rolls around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face went scarlet. The question was blunt and borderline invasive, and it threw her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she figured he was diagnosing her&mdash;like a patient, not a person. "Yeah," she admitted. "It's brutal. Feels like I'm dying every time&mdash;vomiting, passing out, the works. It's screwed up my job more than once. I've seen tons of doctors, but nothing's fixed it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, unfazed. "Let me take a quick look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say yes or no, his hand was on her stomach again, pressing gently through her shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe flinched, her whole body tingling as heat bloomed under his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks burned, but she told herself he was checking her out&mdash;medically, that is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat there, tense as a coiled spring, while a warm current flowed from his palm into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It spread through her abdomen, a weird mix of electric and soothing that made her squirm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft hum slipped from her lips before she could stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes fluttered shut as the heat sank deeper, easing something she hadn't even realized was knotted up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It lasted maybe two minutes before Marcus pulled his hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already clocked her issue: killer cramps from that icy chill in her system, bad enough to mess with her whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can clear that cold out for you," he said casually. "Fix the cramps and whatever else it's stirring up there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe blinked, still dazed from the sensation. He was talking about using his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, his voice steady as if he were offering to fix a busted phone instead of rewriting her whole damn system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't get a chance to ask more before a loud banging rattled the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, asshole, get out here! I brought backup&mdash;you're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Chloe's brother, Everett Sinclair, hollering like a lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My brother's here," Chloe said, her face tightening. "He's probably got his sketchy crew with him. Stay put&mdash;I'll shoo them off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." Marcus said, standing. "He keeps coming back. He'll just keep hassling you. Let's settle this now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the door open. Outside stood a handful of rough-looking guys, Everett front and center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was swollen from a punch Marcus had landed earlier, giving him a lopsided, almost comical glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, look at you, tough guy," Everett snarled. "Big balls stepping out here to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jabbed a thumb at the guy next to him. "Meet Stanley&mdash;from Serpent's Coil outta Solomia. You messed with me, and now you're gonna pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, sizing up the group. "All of you with Serpent's Coil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell at a glance&mdash;they were junkies, every one of them, including Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serpent's Coil was an underground outfit Marcus knew well; he'd taken it over a while back and laid down strict rules: no drugs, no dealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these clowns were from Serpent's Coil, something was rotten in the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we're from Serpent's Coil," Stanley said, smirking. He was a big dude, broad-shouldered and cocky, looking less strung-out than the rest. "What, scared now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's stomach dropped. Serpent's Coil wasn't just some street gang&mdash;it was the top dog in Solomia's underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past year, it'd clawed its way to the top, pretty much owning the whole damn scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just its size&mdash;it had heavy hitters, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it half its crew were Wizards, with guys like Jalen, a master Wizard, and Edgar, a hardcore Warrior, leading the pack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of combo was rare as hell across Uswad's city underbellies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And their gear? Top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had laser guns that carved through rival gangs like butter&mdash;unstoppable, people said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't some lightweight; she'd watched him tear it up at that awards gala, his sniper team covering his back like a hawk squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, stacked against the Serpent's Coil's firepower, magic, and muscle, she couldn't shake the feeling he might be outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stanley, chill," she cut in, stepping forward. "This is just a dumb spat between me and Everett. Marcus isn't part of it."</span></p><div class="pagination">
