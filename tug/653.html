  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson raised his glass with a smirk. "Relax, Chad. I was just messing with you. But seriously, this drink is on me. You know, we've always been closer than the rest of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Same high school, same college, and let's not forget. You handed me a wife. How could I not thank you for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he picked up Chad's glass and filled it to the brim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!" Chad's fury boiled over. His fists clenched as he launched a punch straight at Jenson's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jenson was ready. He grabbed Chad's wrist mid-air with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad barely scraped 5'5", while Jenson, towering and broad-shouldered, loomed over him. With a flick of his wrist, Jenson threw Chad's arm aside like it weighed nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you forget how badly I beat you up back then?" Jenson sneered. "You still think you can take me on? I've been cutting you slack because we were classmates, but now you're just asking for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad's voice trembled with anger. "Jenson, I thought of you as my best friend. And this is how you repay me? You stole my wife! Do you even have a conscience?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian stepped forward, her high heels clicking against the floor as she crossed her arms. "Enough with the self-pity, Chad. Don't talk about Jenson like that. He's everything you're not. Look at you. Delivering takeout for years? If I'd stayed with you, I'd be stuck in a miserable, broke life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men like you, pathetic, powerless don't deserve to have a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and if you're still sulking about the 500 thousand dollars I took, let's put it to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached into her Herm&egrave;s bag and pulled out a sleek card, tossing it toward Chad like it was trash. The card struck his face and landed at his feet. "There's five million dollars on that card. The PIN's all zeroes. That's ten times what I took from you. Consider it payback. We're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room went dead silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every eye turned to Chad. The air was thick with tension, and the crowd was on edge, waiting for his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Vivian wasn't just offering money. This was a public humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But five million for a guy who delivered takeout was a life-changing amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quit pretending to be noble," Vivian sneered, her tone sharp enough to cut. "Pick it up already. Let me spell it out for you. Five million is nothing to me. My husband spends more than that on a single dinner. He makes billions every year. You? You'll never measure up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze bore into him, her lips curled in disdain. She wanted to crush him, to show him just how far out of his league she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad's hands balled into fists, his face twisted with rage. But before he could speak, a steady hand landed on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had stood up, his expression calm but his eyes blazing with resolve. He gave Chad a reassuring nod before turning to face Jenson and Vivian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are unbelievable. You strut around like you're better than everyone else, but do you even hear yourselves? You're nothing but liars and cheats, and you still have the nerve to act like you're in the right. Do you even know what shame is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian let out a sharp laugh. "And who the hell are you? My husband's wealth puts you and your big mouth to shame. Stay out of this, or he'll make sure you're out of this city by tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a cold smile. "Your husband's wealth? You really think Jenson is untouchable? Let me tell you something. You'd be surprised how quickly I could make the two of you lose everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every pair of eyes darted toward Marcus, their disbelief written across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the crowd broke into quiet snickers or exchanged looks of ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson wasn't just rich. He was the richest among their classmates, pulling in billions each year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could someone like Marcus possibly take him down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Natalie, who had been watching quietly, rolled her eyes in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson burst into laughter, clapping his hands like he'd heard the best joke of the century. "Marcus, I get it. You're trying to be the hero here. But you seriously need to tone down the delusions. Do you even know who I am?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I make billions every year, Marcus. I could bury you in cash if I wanted to. What makes you think you can even talk to me like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever heard of Sync Group in Kingston? I'm their top supplier of precision parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With their production scaling up, my revenue's about to explode. Billions? That's just the start. We're talking tens of billions. Maybe even hundreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wouldn't even understand numbers that big."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I'm starting to think your so-called money isn't clean. Who knows what shady deals you've been pulling to afford this act?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd let out a collective gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's words painted an image of untouchable wealth and power. To the classmates, he was invincible.</span></p><div class="pagination">
