Perfect timing&mdash;arrest them all together." As he spoke, he waved at the officers to take action. The police moved forward, seemingly ready to arrest not just Marcus but also Amelia and the Department of Justice staff with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm bluffing? These people behind me are from the Department of Justice. I dare you to lay a finger on us." Amelia's icy gaze swept over the officers, her words sharp and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Amelia had been curious why Benjamin treated Marcus with such respect. After learning more about Marcus, she realized that this seemingly ordinary young man in his early twenties was far more capable&mdash;and influential&mdash;than she'd imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she discovered that Marcus had cured Benjamin's daughter, who had been </span><span>gravely ill with leukemia, Amelia knew Marcus' identity was anything but simple. Even if Marcus weren't someone special, he'd saved Benjamin's daughter&mdash;someone no ordinary person could afford to offend. Her declaration stunned the crowd into silence, especially Joseph and Madeline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline sneered, "You little tramp, stop pretending. Department of Justice, huh? My husband is the director of the city's construction bureau. Do you know how many important people I've met? If I let you keep babbling, the next thing you'll say is you work for the mayor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't bother responding to Madeline's taunts. Instead, she turned to her colleagues and said, "Show them your badges." The Department of Justice staff nodded, producing their IDs. The badges bore detailed titles and the city government's official seal, unmistakable and legitimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as realization dawned on everyone. "They're... really from the Department of Justice?" Madeline stammered, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her husband, Adam, had a lot to hide&mdash;years of embezzlement, bribes, and abuse of power. Whenever she encountered anyone from the Department of Justice, she couldn't help but feel a pang of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Department of Justice officers stepped forward, his tone steady and authoritative. "We're acting under orders from the higher-ups to investigate Adam Parker, director of the city's construction bureau, for corruption, bribery, and misconduct. As his spouse, you're required to cooperate with us. Come with us, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline's face went pale, her composure crumbling as panic set in. It felt like her world was collapsing. But she refused to believe it. She thought, "Sure, Adam has done some shady things, but he has spent years cultivating a web of powerful connections. With his "protection," how could this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're making baseless accusations," Madeline snapped, her voice desperate. "My husband is an honest man&mdash;a model official. If you keep this up, I'll sue you for defamation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her defiance was short-lived. Her phone rang, and the name "Adam" lit up the screen. "Honey..." Madeline began nervously, but before she could continue, Adam's furious voice roared from the other end. "You idiot! Did you offend someone again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline, flustered, tried to explain. "No, I didn't. I'm at our son's parent-teacher meeting and just had a small argument with some country bumpkin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fool," Adam yelled. "The Department of Justice is here! I'm finished&mdash;completely finished." Before she could respond, the line went dead. Dizziness overtook Madeline, and her legs gave out. She collapsed onto the floor, her face full of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take her away," one of the Department of Justice officers commanded. Two officers stepped forward and restrained Madeline, leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this, Joseph, Nora, and George were visibly shaken. Each of them had skeletons in their closets&mdash;violations that could easily land them in similar trouble if exposed. Their fear was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, one of the Department of Justice officers approached Marcus, bowing respectfully in front of everyone. "Mr. Fitzgerald, Mayor Benjamin has instructed us to assist you fully in investigating all involved parties. If there's anything else you need, just let us know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned into silence. They thought, "Mayor Benjamin? This young man&mdash;a so-called "country bumpkin"&mdash;knows the mayor? How is that even possible? And not only does he know the mayor, but the mayor has personally ordered the </span><span>Department of Justice to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications are clear: Marcus holds a position of extraordinary significance in the mayor's eyes."</span></p><div class="pagination">
