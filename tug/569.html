I'll give you a hundred of these guns first. They'll arrive in about three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he called Diana and told her the specific address of Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you so much. If we had a hundred of these guns, no one in Kingston could defeat us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake said with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I hope so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded and said to Blake, "I'm busy, so I'll leave the aftermath to you guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake agreed happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus left the Axe Gang and went to see Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, before he went to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, he had promised her that he would return in two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he received a call from Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you back?

You said you'd come to see me in two days, but now 48 hours and 53 minutes have passed," Lila said with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was surprised and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My stepmother has come to Kingston and is now at my sister's house.

At least she never abused me since I was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have always regarded her as my family. Even though my father is dead, I go home to visit her every year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila grew up in a reorganized family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was relatively lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least her stepmother was nice to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila asked with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in a relationship now, after all, and Marcus wouldn't say no to Lila's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marcus and Lila met at Lila's home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila put on her makeup and clothes before she went downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had dinner at a famous restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's stepmother, Jacqueline Sassoon, sister, Liz Sassoon, and Liz's boyfriend, Abraham Toynbee, had already arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, we missed you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she and Lila had no blood relationship, they had a good relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz said sarcastically with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Lila is a star now and very busy.
