  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena's face lit up like she'd just won the lottery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe, on the other hand, looked like she was barely holding back her anger. So that was it. Miles had decided to shove this award into Selena's hands, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena swayed her hips, already making her way toward the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not accepting this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could take another step, Chloe shot up from her seat, her voice ringing through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' gaze flicked toward her, his expression tightening. "The award was decided through public voting and the judges' scores. Selena had the highest total. What exactly are you complaining about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe took a steady breath, her voice clear and sharp. "The public vote was open for everyone to see. I had 85.98 million votes. Selena was in second place with 35.89 million. That's not even close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I understand, this award is supposed to be based primarily on public votes, with the judges acting as a secondary factor. Even if you paid off every judge on the panel, the fact remains&mdash;I had twice as many votes as Selena. So tell me, Mr. Miles Donovan, how exactly did she end up winning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's words hit like a hammer&mdash;direct, undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murmur ran through the crowd, growing louder as people nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Chloe's supporters, who wasted no time shouting their protests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' face darkened. Selena's smile twitched. Neither of them had expected Chloe to stand up and call them out in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she out of her mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does she really think she can go up against Royal Entertainment and walk away unscathed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena took a step forward, her eyes locking onto Chloe's with an icy smirk. "Oh, come on, Chloe. Don't be a sore loser. Public votes? Please. You think those numbers can't be manipulated? If the organizers say I won, then I won. Now sit down before you embarrass yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe didn't flinch. She met Selena's gaze, unimpressed. "Oh, give it a rest. We both know how you got that award.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't win it. You slept your way to it. And honestly? Bragging about an award you had to buy is just pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe had never had the patience for women who played the casting couch game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Selena? She took it to another level&mdash;shamelessly clinging to Miles just to snatch a title she didn't earn. The thought of it made Chloe sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second the words left her mouth, the room shifted. Miles and Selena both went rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew about Selena and Miles. But no one ever said it out loud. It was an open secret&mdash;something people accepted and ignored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one dared to say it out loud. In this industry, it was just business as usual&mdash;an unspoken rule everyone pretended not to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? Chloe had just ripped the lid off it in the middle of the biggest event of the year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch!" Selena snapped, her voice shaking with rage. "Say that again, I dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spun toward Miles, her voice sharp with fury. "Mr. Donovan, this bitch is making a scene and ruining the ceremony. I say we have security beat her down and toss her out. Make sure she never works in Uswad's entertainment industry again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' expression turned stone cold. He flicked a hand toward the security team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his signal, a wave of security guards moved in, nightsticks in hand. In seconds, Chloe and Marcus were surrounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles stepped forward, his tone low and dangerous. "Calling the award rigged is one thing. But throwing out baseless accusations? You just made this personal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with something mean. "And if Mr. Death weren't showing up tonight, trust me&mdash;I wouldn't be letting you off this easy. You'd be paying a much heavier price."</span></p><div class="pagination">
