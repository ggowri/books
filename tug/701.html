  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare touch Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold command cut through the ballroom, drawing everyone's attention to the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of men came striding in&mdash;there had to be at least thirty of them, all armed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what really caught everyone's eye were the two guys leading the pack, both with holstered pistols and an air of authority that no one could miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit, that's Alaric&mdash;the Golden Hotel's manager. He actually brought his crew </span><span>here," someone whispered. The murmurs spread through the crowd like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's his deal?" another person muttered. "The Golden Hotel's got nothing to do with this mess. Why's he jumping in to protect some bodyguard? What's the connection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross' thugs froze in their tracks. Nobody was dumb enough to make a move now. Ross himself looked like he'd just swallowed something nasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Royal Entertainment business," Ross spat out. "The Golden Hotel has no right sticking its nose in here. We rented this whole ballroom fair and square. It's not affecting your business one bit. What's your angle here, Alaric? You looking to start a war between Golden Hotel and Royal Entertainment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alaric cast an icy glare at Ross before speaking, "Mr. Walsh, your actions have become far more serious than simply disrupting our hotel's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is the Golden Hotel's most distinguished guest. Anyone who threatens his safety is making an enemy of the Golden Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even your status as the heir to Royal Entertainment won't change that. If you insist on threatening Mr. Fitzgerald, we'll have no choice but to stand against you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, two men from Alaric's group deliberately shifted their jackets to reveal the handguns at their waists&mdash;a clear warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross' face darkened with anger. "I don't understand," he said bitterly. "He's just a worthless security guard. How could he possibly be your most distinguished guest? Are you joking with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Chloe and Lucy looked equally confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't comprehend why the Golden Hotel would risk making an enemy of Royal Entertainment over someone as lowly as Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila had finally had enough of hearing everyone </span><span>refer</span><span> to Marcus as a mere security guard. "Mr. Fitzgerald isn't a security guard at all," she interrupted. "He's the owner of Stellar Entertainment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left everyone stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a surprising revelation that Stellar Entertainment, which had risen to prominence in the last two years, had been mysteriously acquired and that this man standing before them was the buyer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most people's shock quickly subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True, being the owner of Stellar Entertainment carried more prestige than being a security guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> entertainment industry, companies like Stellar Entertainment were a dime a dozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those present, there were dozens of entertainment companies, most of which were more powerful than Stellar Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stellar Entertainment couldn't even compete with these mid-tier companies, let alone Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between them was too big&mdash;there was simply no comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Marcus' actions today, everyone believed that Royal Entertainment wouldn't let this slide, regardless of whether he was a security guard or Stellar Entertainment's owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me make this absolutely clear," Alaric stated firmly. "Mr. Fitzgerald is the Golden Hotel's most distinguished guest, and I will not tolerate anyone disrespecting our guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walsh, if you insist on continuing this behavior, I'll have no choice but to escort everyone associated with Royal Entertainment out of the Golden Hotel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alaric finished speaking, his two companions drew their guns and aimed directly at Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the weapon barrels pointing at him made everyone gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could believe the Golden Hotel was actually serious about protecting Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he was the owner of Stellar Entertainment, it wasn't worth going this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe a small-time hotel manager from </span><span>Solomia</span><span> has the nerve to talk to Mr. Walsh like that," Lucy cut in, seizing her moment. "Don't you know Mr. Walsh could crush you with a snap of his fingers? He's got that kind of power. Take my advice&mdash;stay out of this mess unless you want to get burned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy knew that showing support for Ross in his moment of crisis would catch his attention. It was exactly what she needed to get closer to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, the sound of a sharp slap cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Lucy could even finish speaking, Alaric's hand connected with her face, leaving an angry red welt blooming across her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You</span><span> social media wannabe," he spat. "Did getting a few followers make you think you're actually somebody? You've got no business butting into my affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snatched a gun from one of his men and pressed it against her forehead. "Open your mouth again, and I'll show you exactly what happens to people who don't know when to shut up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy froze, her </span><span>whole body</span><span> trembling. The color drained from her face as she collapsed to the ground. "Please," she whimpered, "don't kill me..."</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
