  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy wasn't afraid of offending Lila anymore. She was too busy trying to score points with Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, is that so? Well, now I'm really curious about what makes this bodyguard so special," Ross said with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he and Lucy were playing off each other, one would think they'd rehearsed this little act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross turned his attention to Marcus, his voice dripping with ice. "</span><span>So</span><span> you're Lila's bodyguard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even bother sitting up straight. He just stayed slouched in his chair and gave Ross a lazy nod. "Yeah, what's it to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross looked Marcus up and down like he was something stuck to his shoe. "I'm just dying to know how a nobody bodyguard managed to hook up with our country music goddess. I mean, she even turned me down&mdash;the heir to Royal Entertainment&mdash;for you. What's your secret? Come on, share some tips."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus barely gave Ross a glance before sneering back, "Pretty sure that's none of your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer jumped in before Marcus could even finish his sentence. "Who do you think you are? You're just some low-life bodyguard talking back to Mr. Walsh like that. Do you have a death wish or something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer's outburst got plenty of heads nodding. After all, Ross was Royal Entertainment's golden boy. Nobody in the entertainment industry was crazy enough to mess with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The party was packed with entertainment bigwigs and A-list celebrities, all of them practically falling over themselves to show respect to Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Marcus' attitude was so jarring&mdash;not only did he show zero respect to Ross, but there was a clear edge of hostility in everything he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was baffled. Where did this guy get the nerve?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about mentoring," Marcus said with a cold smirk, barely glancing at Ross. "I don't waste my time on spoiled rich kids. And by the way, keep your lapdog on a tighter leash. His barking is getting annoying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room went dead silent. No one could believe what they were hearing. Marcus wasn't just being disrespectful to Ross&mdash;he'd straight-up called Ross' photographer a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any photographer either. The guy had been Ross' right-hand man for years. Everyone knew that insulting someone's trusted employee was basically the same as insulting them directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your damn mouth, young man!" the photographer snapped, his face red with anger. Being called a dog in front of the industry's rising starlets was more than he could take. "Say that again, and I'll end you right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even bother looking at the photographer. Instead, he turned to Lila with an amused smile. "See what I mean? The dog's barking again. Shame its owner can't teach it better manners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That comment sent the photographer over the edge. "You're really </span><span>gonna</span><span> call me a dog again? I'll smash your face in for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without giving a damn about his reputation, he swung a vicious punch straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason he had the guts to attack Marcus in public was because Ross had his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being the entertainment industry's golden boy, Ross could smooth over any mess he made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he killed this trash-talking punk right here, the Walsh family's connections could make it all go away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> the photographer didn't hold back, aiming his punch straight for Marcus' temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped while Lucy and the other starlets watched with smirks on their faces, eager to see Marcus get his comeuppance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the punch could land, Marcus' hand shot out and locked around the photographer's wrist in an iron grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer's eyes widened in shock. He hadn't expected Marcus to be this strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to yank his arm free but couldn't budge an inch. "Listen here, you little punk," he snarled. "I'm giving you three seconds to let go, or I'll make you wish you were never born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even acknowledge the threat. Instead, he slammed the photographer's arm down onto the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in one swift motion, he grabbed a steel fork and drove it straight through the photographer's hand, pinning it to the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer let out a blood-curdling scream as he stared at his impaled hand in pure horror. Everyone else froze in shock. None of them could believe Marcus had just pulled something this extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe, Lucy, and the other actresses screamed and backed away, their faces white as sheets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lila, sitting right next to Marcus, jumped in her seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your boss won't keep you in line, I guess I'll have to do it myself," Marcus growled. Without missing a beat, he planted his boot in the photographer's chest, sending him flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer clutched his bleeding hand, looking like he might pass out any second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross' face turned an ugly shade of purple. He couldn't believe Marcus had the nerve to attack one of his guys in public, let alone stab him through the hand with a fork. This was way beyond excessive.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
