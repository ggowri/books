  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emotionless Gorge, located in the Kinton Mountains," Gertie replied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emotionless Gorge? Your training place is actually called that</span><span>?</span><span> Are you emotionless now?" Marcus couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie's cheeks flushed as she said, "I didn't name it, my aunt did. It has nothing to do with me. Stop </span><span>ask</span><span>ing, will you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded with a smile and said, "So, does that mean your aunt is the emotionless one?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie couldn't help but sigh and said, "My aunt... was once hurt by someone she loved, so she named this gorge Emotionless Gorge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She was hurt by that man</span><span> and</span><span> never got married. She hates men the most. </span><span>What</span><span> a pitiful woman."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For some reason, through Gertie's description, Marcus could picture what Gertie's aunt looked like.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He always felt that women hurt by love, though pitiful, </span><span>were </span><span>often eccentric, even to the point of being sharp-tongued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he really hoped he wouldn't encounter her this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting the exact location from Gertie, Marcus took her and used teleport.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few seconds, the two arrived at the Emotionless Gorge deep in the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The area was lush with vegetation, surrounded by towering mountains whose peaks were covered in snow year-round, resembling an isolated paradise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why do you have the ability of teleport?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie looked at how she had traveled from Solomia to Emotionless Gorge in such a short time, her face full of shock, unable to believe her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't ask. Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand," Marcus said casually, unwilling to reveal too many of his secrets to Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't that he didn't trust her, but the fewer people knew about such secrets, the better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Marcus was unwilling to t</span><span>ell</span><span>, Gertie had no choice but to drop it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, under Gertie's guidance, the two arrived outside an ancient courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This </span><span>courtyard carried</span><span> Uswad's ancient architectural style, giving one the feeling of being instantly transported back in time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gertie, you're back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the two even entered the courtyard, a girl around seventeen or eighteen ran over to greet Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing someone there, Gertie looked a bit flustered and said, "Yeah, I'm back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This girl was from her clan and rarely appeared in Emotionless Gorge, so it was unexpected to meet her here today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is this?" The girl's gaze instantly fell on Marcus, asking </span><span>with </span><span>curios</span><span>ity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emotionless Gorge ha</span><span>d</span><span> a rule that </span><span>forbade </span><span>men from entering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>hat girl</span><span> always saw </span><span>Gertie </span><span>as someone who </span><span>had always strictly followed this rule.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though her aunt had already </span><span>given</span><span> Emotionless Gorge to Gertie, Gertie had never brought any man here. </span><span>What </span><span>Gertie </span><span>had done </span><span>today left her very puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He is my friend. I got injured </span><span>when I was </span><span>outside, </span><span>so he was here</span><span> to help me heal," Gertie explained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girl nodded and then said, "I won't disturb you two. Be careful not to let anyone else find out, especially Ms. Minerva Leah."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The "Ms. Minerva Leah" mentioned was Gertie's aunt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll be careful..." Gertie replied somewhat awkwardly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, she brought Marcus back to heal h</span><span>er</span><span> injuries, but it felt like sneaking around, making her feel embarrassed in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry about that," Gertie said to Marcus, a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and asked, "Isn't this your yard? Why so cautious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie had no choice but to explain the rules of Emotionless Gorge to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, finding it quite bizarre, and casually asked, "So if your aunt finds me, am I doomed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie said stiffly, "Don't worry, if </span><span>that happens</span><span>, I'll </span><span>protect</span><span> you. You won't get hurt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, the two entered a room in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room wasn't large, but it was elegantly decorated, exuding a faint girlish fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the room I usually stay in. No one comes here</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>I</span><span>t's very quiet. You can help me heal now," Gertie said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, sit cross-legged on the bed," Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, it's just for healing... Promise me, don't have any other thoughts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie seemed to think of something and couldn't help but remind Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, his gaze brazenly sweeping over Gertie, lingering a moment longer on her chest, and said, "Don't worry, I definitely won't have other thoughts, but I can't </span><span>make sure that</span><span> you </span><span>can do</span><span> the same."</span></p><div class="pagination">
