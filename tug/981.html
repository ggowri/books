  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin couldn't help but feel even more relieved that he had chosen the right side. Had he not firmly stood by Marcus, he would most likely have been ousted and investigated just like Hank and the others, facing imprisonment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lloyd, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Dustin was silently congratulating himself for his wise decision, Marcus's voice reached his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound made him instinctively flinch, and a stiff, forced smile appeared on his face as he quickly responded, "It's nothing, Mr. Fitzgerald. You flatter me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Dustin straightened up, standing tall like a fresh recruit on parade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until today that he truly understood Marcus's position, which made him even more respectful and deferential toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've dealt with you more than once now, and we're friends. From now on, you don't have to be so formal. Just call me Marcus," Marcus said, waving his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This marked the third time Marcus and Dustin had interacted. The first time was at the Bayside Pharmaceutical Industrial Park, the second at the hospital entrance, and now this time. Each time, Dustin had stood by Marcus's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Dustin hadn't been able to assist much, Marcus had a good impression of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus's words, Dustin froze for a moment, then a proud smile spread across his face. "It's an honor to be considered a friend by you. From now on, if you need anything, just let me know, and I'll risk my life to help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Mr. Lloyd, if there's nothing else, you can go back to your duties." Marcus waved his hand, signaling for him to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll take my leave now." Dustin nodded to Marcus before commanding his team from the Solomia Police Department to quickly depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The neighbors who had been watching were utterly dumbfounded. No one had expected that the young woman who had been renting a place was actually the girlfriend of the Special Military Advisor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the ridiculous thing was that Helen, the obese wife of Dexter, had tried to withhold this girl's deposit. It was nothing short of self-sabotage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, not only had she been arrested, but her husband, Dexter, was also implicated. Even her cousin, Hank, the major of Solomia, had been stripped of his position and was under investigation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This prompted everyone to think of four words: "The Omen of Doom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen certainly fit that description. Without her, Dexter and Hank would never have been arrested so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this incident, the neighbors came to an important life lesson: Never underestimate anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In everyday life, people might seem unremarkable, but they could very well be someone you could never hope to reach. These individuals often kept a low profile and didn't flaunt their status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen, however, had been arrogant, self-righteous, and domineering, which had led her to bring about her own downfall, ruining the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, where are we going now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone had left, Kiera couldn't help but ask Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and replied, "I'm buying you a house. You'll be moving into the new place tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Kiera's face instantly flushed red, and a happy smile appeared on her face. It seemed Marcus wasn't joking when he said he would buy her a house before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera didn't refuse, of course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Marcus drove his Aston Martin, taking Kiera to visit several popular residential properties near Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Kiera had only planned to buy a simple two-bedroom apartment. But Marcus insisted on getting her either a river-view flat or a villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera couldn't argue with Marcus, so she chose the river-view penthouse. A villa felt too empty, especially since she would be living there alone most of the time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
