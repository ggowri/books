  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Incredibly terrifying energy from the heavens and earth gathered towards Marcus from all directions, swirling and churning in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive cloud formed, illuminated by constant flashes of lightning within it, lighting up the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the cloud, a beam of light shot up into the sky as if connecting with the sky; releasing an extremely intense energy fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, top powerhouses from various countries all looked up at the eastern sky, they were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone actually broke through the Return Essence stage, and it triggered such a strong phenomenon. It seems that guy is not simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had similar thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had not witnessed such a strange phenomenon for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Generally, only those with extraordinary talent and powerful strength had the chance to trigger such phenomena when breaking through the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that the person who broke through was a chosen one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the time difference, it was afternoon in Acoton at this time. In a luxurious manor, an elderly man sat in a wheelchair, pruning the branches and leaves of flowers and plants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed the strong energy fluctuations coming from the eastern sky, and his blue pupils trembled. He then looked in that direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a look of gratification appeared on his aged face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is indeed my son," the old man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to his advanced age and chronic illness, he could no longer move normally and had to rely on a wheelchair to get around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he saw the phenomenon emanating from the east, he felt as if he had become ten years younger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a rarely visited underground command center on an ice field, a tall, handsome man dressed in military attire stood before a sand table. A cold glint flashed in his blue eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at the strange scene displayed on the screen, a murderous intent flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In just a few months, he reached the Return Essence stage. I don't believe Father didn't help him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside the young man stood a beautiful woman in tight leather, her figure stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus were there, he would undoubtedly recognize her as the Demon Fighter Alison, who had attempted to kill him some time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar, according to my investigation, Godfather met him only once. After that, he lost contact with Marcus. He only left Diana by Marcus' side and didn't provide any other help to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's brows furrowed, and a unique aura emanated from him, making the entire space feel oppressive. "Then how did his cultivation advance so quickly? He must have some unknown secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Mr. Roger Gellar, do you remember that we sent mercenaries to assassinate Uswad's high-ranking official Julian? He ruined it," Alison added unwillingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Roger's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming coercion enveloped the command room, causing some glass containers to shatter. "Damn it. I must kill him within a month and make him have no peace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus was still using the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to stabilize his realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not until 9.00 AM that he finally solidified his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he became a true Acquired State powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breaking through to the Acquired State, his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire also reached the sixth level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the first five levels, Marcus acquired five special abilities: X-ray vision, Celestial Reversal, Teleport, Dual Cultivation, and Devouring Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These five abilities were different from the cultivation system of Ancient Martial Art and were powers that normal warriors could not obtain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire broke through to the sixth level, Marcus felt he had gained a new ability&mdash;thought reading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thought reading, as the name implied, was the ability to read the thoughts of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike stealing someone's memories, thought reading could only read the target's thoughts from the past few minutes but was simple and convenient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stealing someone's memories typically required the use of special secret techniques, consuming a significant amount of energy for the practitioner, and causing permanent damage to the person whose memories were read, potentially even leading to brain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, thought reading was different. It only required Marcus' mental control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that he could glance at the target and instantly know what they were thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Natalia had just woken up from her slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her eyes still half-closed, before she could speak, Marcus already knew she wanted to eat KFC.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, do you want a KFC chicken leg burger with fries and cola?" Marcus asked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially confused, Natalia perked up immediately upon hearing Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up abruptly and asked Marcus, "How did you know? Can you read my mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "Not only do you want KFC. You also thought about whether to go back to school today or take another day off to accompany me. Because you have an important class and can't take leave, you planned to return to school before noon, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All her thoughts had been guessed by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Marcus in horror and stammered, "How do you know what I'm thinking? How did you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a mysterious smile. "Because I can read minds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia pouted, clearly not believing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Isn't it something only found in online novels? How could an ordinary person like Marcus possibly read minds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much Natalia guessed, she couldn't figure out the specific reason, so she simply stopped guessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to eat KFC. Marcus, order for me," Natalia said, acting cute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Marcus picked up his phone and placed a delivery for Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After eating, just as Marcus had mentioned, Natalia had an important class in the afternoon and had to return to school before noon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Natalia hurriedly bid farewell to Marcus and went back to Kingston University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Babe, have you finished your business?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Natalia left, Marcus received a message from Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied: [I'm done. Where are you?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie sent a voice message, her tone revealing a hint of plea. "I'm at home. I have a college class reunion in the afternoon. Since you're here, come with me. My two good friends have been wanting to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no reason to refuse. [Sure.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His main purpose for coming to Kingston had already been fulfilled, and the remaining time was left for Natalia, Josie, and Melina, the three women related to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus agreed, Josie was very pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got up, tidied himself up, and took a taxi to Josie's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Josie was at her vanity, doing her makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hugged her from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, you're so naughty." Josie was startled. She turned her head to look at Marcus' handsome face, her cheeks flushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kissed her red lips passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still need to do my makeup. Stop messing around."</span></p><div class="pagination">
