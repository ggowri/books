  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications of someone having the power to grant Supreme Tokens left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their minds struggled to process this new reality as they stood frozen in place, their hearts pounding in their chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross stared at Marcus with glazed eyes, his expression filled with disbelief. "Someone who can grant Supreme Token? That's impossible," he muttered. "He's just the owner of some small entertainment company from the mainland. How could he possibly hold such an esteemed position?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is far beyond your level," Victor growled at Ross. "Even your grandfather doesn't have the authority to meddle in these matters. There's only one way for your family to survive this. You need to get on your knees and beg this gentleman for forgiveness. Otherwise, no one will be able to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ross could even react, Victor grabbed him by the hair and slammed his head toward the ground. The sound of impact echoed through the room&mdash;thud, thud, thud...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rhythmic thuds resonated through the room, each impact sending chills down the spines of the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here was Ross&mdash;the heir to Royal Entertainment, a man whose single word could make or break any star's career&mdash;being forced to kneel before Marcus at the post-awards ceremony reception, repeatedly bowing his head in desperate apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd at the banquet hall gathered around, watching in horror as blood started streaming down Ross' face. The sight of such a powerful figure brought so low sent shivers through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Victor's voice was pleading as he forced Ross to kneel, "my student has offended you. I'll make him kneel and apologize. Please, just spare his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus furrowed his brows, his voice cool. "He's been threatening me this whole time, and he had the nerve to say he'd sleep with my woman right in front of everyone. You really think a simple apology is going to cut it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beads of sweat broke out on Victor's forehead. "What would it take for you to forgive my student, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make him bow to the ground a hundred times," Marcus said flatly. "Then he can kneel there and slap himself until I'm satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't care less about dealing with someone like Ross. If he'd wanted to, he could have ended Ross' life just for those disrespectful comments about Lila. But this punishment would do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words made everyone's jaws drop. He demanded that Ross bow to him a hundred times and slap himself repeatedly&mdash;and he'd only be allowed to stop when Marcus was satisfied. It was absolutely brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ross was Royal Entertainment's heir. Marcus clearly didn't give a damn about who Ross was or what his family could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lila was stunned. She'd been worried about Marcus this whole time, but now, it seemed like that worry was definitely misplaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's reaction was the real shocker. Instead of protesting, his face lit up like he'd </span><span>just dodged a bullet. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you are being incredibly merciful." He turned to Ross. "You better do exactly what he says, or Royal Entertainment might find itself wiped off the map in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> </span><span>real</span><span> quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dead serious look on Victor's face finally made Ross realize that he'd picked a fight with the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ross didn't back down now, he'd drag both Royal Entertainment and the Walsh family down with him. He'd be remembered as the one who brought shame to the Walsh name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross couldn't bear the thought of being responsible for his family's downfall. So, he started slamming his forehead against the floor in desperate apology, each bow punctuated by words of remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a hundred bows, Ross' forehead was a bloody mess, with crimson streams running down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gone was any trace of the privileged heir he'd been just moments ago. Instead, he looked utterly broken, almost terrifying in his desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Ross crawled to Marcus' feet and started slapping himself hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp sounds echoed through the banquet hall. Each strike made everyone flinch, the sound alone enough to send chills down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had mocked Marcus earlier were especially on edge now. They stood frozen, terrified that Marcus might turn his attention to them next, making them pay for their disrespect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy was shaking uncontrollably, her face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every taunting word she'd said to Marcus, every time she'd tried to curry favor with Ross by stirring up trouble&mdash;it all came rushing back to her. She collapsed to the </span><span>floor,</span><span> her eyes wide with horror as the full weight of her situation hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alaric's heart was racing. He'd already known Marcus was the mysterious power behind the Golden Group&mdash;which was impressive enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alaric never thought that even </span><span>Southvaia's</span><span> notorious Bloodthirsty Cult treated Marcus with such reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That took things to a whole new level. His respect for Marcus shot through the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Golden Hotel is famous throughout </span><span>Uswad</span><span> for its wine collection," Marcus said casually, completely ignoring Ross, who was still slapping himself on the ground. He reached for a bottle and poured a glass for Lila. "It would be a shame not to try some while we're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's hands trembled as she stared at Ross kneeling and slapping himself across from them. How could anyone think about wine at a time like this?</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
