Every time the heavy submachine gun in his hand pulls the trigger, there will be people from the Black Hawk Legion lying in a pool of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he, like an unrivaled god of war, released a powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his leadership, the swat team members of several groups are also in high spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than half an hour, they wiped out the enemy with very few casualties!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Black Hawk Legion has nothing special, and the God of War is terrible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, with the presence of the Lord of War, I knew that Black Hawk Legion would fail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several SWAT officers got together and talked about it in succession, and looked at Oliver's eyes with a touch of worship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver was non-stop check those bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he constantly stripped off the masks of those people, he looked grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Abel and Josiah are not among these people. The data center is in danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone come with me and enter the data center immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone responded quickly and headed for the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except Maxine, no one found Marcus had quietly disappeared from the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did he go? Why is he so unreliable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was secretly thinking. She couldn't care so much but entered the date center following them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as they arrived, there was a burst of intensive gunfire inside the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets rained down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two SWAT officers who walked in front were shot in succession, and blood poured out instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are from the Black Hawk Legion They have occupied our data center. Don't rush forward. Be careful of their ambush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver looked gloomy and quickly stopped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vigilantly used the lens to reflect light and observe the movements in the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised to find that a huge hole appeared on the ground inside the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People from the Black Hawk Legion were constantly crawling out of the hole and entering the data center!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To deceive us, these guys even chose to dig holes and sneak into the data center. The previous wave of people was to attract our attention. Damn it!" Oliver said in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Maxine and several other people who questioned Marcus thought of what Marcus had said before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was guessed by Marcus. Did he predict the action plan of the Black Hawk Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, the god of war, never expected this. How could he be a layman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait here. You three come with me and kill them. We can't let these thieves steal our data secrets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver immediately made a decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three fellows nodded at once and looked decisive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine spoke at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver nodded at Maxine and didn't refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking for a suitable time, Oliver was the first to bear the brunt. First, he rang a Grenade and threw it to the nearest shelter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a bang, and the Grenade exploded instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several members of the Black Hawk Legion in the shelters were blown apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Oliver stepped out step by step, and his submachine gun quickly fired at another shelter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His marksmanship was accurate, and his reaction speed was surprisingly fast. Before the other party shoot, the bullet had rained down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people from the Black Hawk Legion in the shelters were also killed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This allowed Maxine and the others to enter the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Uswadian people, how dare you stop us from stealing data secrets? You will all die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An extremely cold voice came from the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Uswadic was not fluent. It was Abel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blond man with a beard standing beside him was another leader of the Black Hawk Legion, Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had learned that the Uswad would take military action against them and try to catch them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This just deliberately spread false news, to confuse Uswadian people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Oliver's reaction entered so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They directly reached the data center to obstruct them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made them very angry, and they were ready to get rid of each other and steal secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intensive gunfire kept ringing, and bullets crisscrossed the data center area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver had been at the forefront.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was brave and extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wherever he went, the people of Black Hawk Legion fell.</span></p><div class="pagination">
