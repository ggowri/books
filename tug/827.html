  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, why aren't you speaking? You look really pale, you must be feeling envious and jealous, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are nothing but an ant in front of me. Stop pretending to be rich. Hurry up and take your girlfriend away. The second-hand car dealership next door is more suitable for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus remain silent, Ronan laughed even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are really arrogant. Do you believe that I can make you lose everything with just one phone call?" Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already decided to deal with Kristen. As a vice president with an annual salary of tens of millions, he had tens of billions in assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Kristen had been embezzling a substantial amount during his tenure. Marcus would never allow someone like that to remain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Marcus finished speaking, both Ronan and Lara laughed, and the female salesperson rolled her eyes dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan looked at Marcus mockingly and said, "What the hell are you talking about? Who do you think you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad is the vice president of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals. BioFusion Pharmaceuticals was established thanks to my dad's efforts. You think a phone call from you can make me lose everything? Are you dreaming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara also laughed and said, "Mr. Wilder, don't mind him. He's just jealous because he sees you have money. Or maybe he's just crazy. We should hurry up and pay so we can leave. I'm planning to serve you well tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female salesperson added, "Ms. Stone is right. Mr. Wilder, you really don't need to waste time with him. Finance will close soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true, then I'll pay and pick up the car first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan nodded and followed the female salesperson into the showroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was checking the car and handling the paperwork, Marcus dialed Josie's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recounted everything that had just happened to Josie in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was furious. She never expected that Kristen would embezzle so much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always trusted Kristen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Josie immediately decided to freeze all accounts and assets under Kristen's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the guidance of the female salesperson, Ronan and Lara had finished inspecting the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was like a work of art, representing the pinnacle of automotive manufacturing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lara, are you satisfied with this car?" Ronan asked Lara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara smiled brightly, "Of course. I love the blue Aventador the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll pay now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan nodded, and then he followed the female salesperson to the finance office to prepare for card payment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The finance staff took the bank card and inserted it into the POS machine. Ronan just had to enter the password to complete the transaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after Ronan entered the password, the POS machine made a prompt sound, "Sorry, insufficient balance on the bank card."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Ronan and the young female salesperson were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan whispered, "What's going on? This card should have more than 90 million Uswadian coins. The total for this car is only 15 million. How could there be insufficient balance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilder, please don't worry. There might be a problem with the POS machine. Let me check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female salesperson immediately followed the finance staff to inspect the POS machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After checking the entire POS machine, Ronan tried to swipe his card again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the POS machine still emitted a failure prompt sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Ronan frown tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The finance staff changed several POS machines for Ronan to try paying again, but the result was still card swipe failures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan felt a bit panicked. "What is going on? My bank card still has a balance, so why can't I make the payment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilder, our store also supports online payments. Why don't you try that?" The female salesperson suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan immediately nodded and began to attempt payment via PayPal, but it still failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried several times until his PayPal account was temporarily frozen, but he still couldn't make the payment successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan completely broke down and felt an ominous premonition arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilder, what is happening? What exactly went wrong?" Lara also became very anxious as she couldn't get her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan comforted her, saying, "Lara, don't worry. I will call my dad to ask what's going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara nodded gently, her delicate face still showing concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All your family's bank accounts have been frozen. It won't help no matter whom you call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus and Natalia walked over with mocking smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan and Lara were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara sarcastically said, "You country bumpkin. We're ignoring you, yet you keep bothering us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are nothing but an ant in front of Mr. Wilder. Do you really think this matter relates to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be a problem with the bank's system. Mr. Wilder can solve it with a phone call. Don't gloat, or I'll have security throw you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female salesperson shot Marcus a fierce glare, her eyes filled with hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus helplessly shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Ronan had already picked up his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could dial, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his dad, Kristen, calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan quickly answered the call and asked, "Dad, why is my bank account frozen? I'm buying a car and can't complete the payment. This is so embarrassing. Please help me resolve this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan had been spoiled since childhood. Whenever he asked Kristen for money, Kristen would give it to him, no matter the amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ronan, I got into trouble. Ms. Shelman discovered my embezzlement and has started investigating me. Our bank accounts are all frozen. We have nothing left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen's voice sounded frantic over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan thought he had misheard and asked again, "Dad, what did you say? I didn't hear clearly. Can you repeat that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen repeated what he had said earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan finally understood, and he was in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt dizzy and almost fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara supported Ronan and asked with concern, "Mr. Wilder, what happened? Please don't scare me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan, with vacant eyes, said, "It's over! It's all over now. My dad is under investigation, and our bank accounts are frozen. I have nothing now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lara trembled as if struck by lightning, her expression completely collapsing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
