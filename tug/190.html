  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Troy could finish his words, Lester slapped him hard in the face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester showed no mercy and exerted great force. Blood gushed out of Troy's nose and mouth, and he cried out in pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you hit the wrong person. You should have beaten that country bumpkin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy looked aggrieved, not knowing why Lester suddenly slapped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm teaching you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester kicked Troy and growled viciously, "You brat, open your eyes wide. Why did you offend Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy was stunned and didn't react for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked in confusion, "Dad, which Mr. Fitzgerald are you talking about? Where is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester was about to explode with anger at Troy. He directly held Troy's head and said through gritted teeth, "Open your eyes wide. This is Mr. Fitzgerald. Didn't I just call you and tell you that I would take you to visit Mr. Fitzgerald tomorrow? To my surprise, you caused such trouble when I wasn't by your side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester pushed Troy forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy was so shocked that he couldn't help but tremble. "Dad, you mean h-he is Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just felt as if he had misheard or hallucinated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was obviously a country bumpkin from Solomia, an unemployed vagrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he be the Death who could casually take out 350 billion dollars to acquire four new industrial groups in Kingston?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Troy's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to confirm it with Lester, but Lester slapped him hard again and urged, "What are you still standing there for? Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald, or no one can protect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester was smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marcus never made it clear, Lester could guess his extraordinary identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy offended Marcus today. If Marcus was unwilling to forgive him, Lester would lose his position as president, and their family might suffer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester's reaction made Troy realize that he had messed with a big shot today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only apologize to Marcus repeatedly. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I was wrong. I was too blind to recognize your identity. Mr. Fitzgerald, I hope you will forgive me this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was panicky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was dumbfounded, especially Melina, Judy, and a dozen other girls, whose hearts couldn't stop trembling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all aware of Lester's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was president of the Rising Group and a well-known figure in Kingston!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, he behaved so humbly in front of Marcus and forced Troy to apologize to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Marcus' status must be much higher than Lester's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus told them that he was just an unemployed man. How could he suddenly become so powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey and Peter were incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew very well what Lester was like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though usually strict with Troy, he was actually very protective of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Troy suffered, Lester would always take revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, when Troy was beaten badly, Lester didn't dare to complain at all. It was simply unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Troy and sneered, "It seems that what you said before doesn't count, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of what he had said before, Troy wanted to slap himself twice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was the Death, whom he had always admired. Yet, he had been so arrogant in front of Marcus. Wasn't he courting death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, please don't bother with me. Ignorance is not a crime. Please forgive me this time. I won't dare to do it again next time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy showed great respect to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, could you please forgive my son just once? I apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus still refused to relent, Lester apologized to him in front of everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Marcus' status was even more exalted than they had imagined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia, who had witnessed the whole thing, gazed at Marcus with admiration.</span></p><div class="pagination">
