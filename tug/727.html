  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Noel's words, Hadley let out a brazen sneer and said to Marcus with biting sarcasm, "What a country bumpkin! Do you understand? Noel is indeed a member of the Ortega family's collateral branch, but so what? Even a servant of the Ortega family is superior to people like you. How dare you provoke Noel? You really have guts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could speak, Noel sneered, "Hadley, don't bother with them for now. The brand promised to give me a reply within half an hour. Let's wait here for a while. When the brand fires this woman, they will no longer be arrogant but burst into tears!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley immediately nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of once again making a fool of Natalie and causing her to shed tears right before her eyes filled her with glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brand truly demonstrated remarkable efficiency. In less than half an hour, Noel's phone rang once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He answered the call and asked, "How is it? Has it been settled?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A very sweet voice came from the other end of the phone. "I'm sorry, Mr. Ortega. After our investigation, we found that Ms. Vance is not an employee of the branch in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, so we can't handle your complaint. I'm really sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel deliberately turned on the speakerphone so that everyone present could hear the conversation distinctly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley froze and then mocked, "Natalie, I was wondering why you were so calm. It turns out you resigned a long time ago. No. You must have been fired by the brand and kicked out, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You started working at this store right after graduating from high school. You've had no experience in any other industries. I'm eager to see what on earth you'll be capable of later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As I recall, your mother suffers from cancer, your father is an alcoholic, and you have a younger brother in college. Your entire family is counting on you to bring in the money. I'm curious to know how you will make a living after you leave this </span><span>industry. You won't become a beggar, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie raised her eyebrows again, and her expression became </span><span>more strange</span><span>. "Who told you that I left this industry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she increasingly empathized with Marcus when he encountered many things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a giant glanced down at the arrogant ants, who were yelling, his state of mind should be like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always adopted the perspective of a giant. At times, he truly didn't feel like offering elaborate explanations or getting into arguments with others, relying on facts to prove everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Natalie's words, Hadley was momentarily taken aback. "Haven't you left this industry? Did you find a job at another store? Our brand is a leading entity in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> jewelry customization industry. The salary and benefits here are top-notch. I find it hard to believe that you could earn a substantial amount by moving to another store. You're bound to regret your decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truly unwilling to squander her time on her, she explained nonchalantly, "You're completely off the mark. I'm still working at this store, but my status has undergone a transformation. As of an hour ago, I've become the brand's exclusive agent in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. All eight stores across the country now fall under my purview!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words dumbfounded Hadley and Noel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all thought they had misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley, in particular, fixed Natalie with an even more scornful stare and scoffed, "Natalie, have you lost your mind? How dare you talk nonsense so blatantly? I suppose you must have gone insane because you couldn't handle the shock of losing this job, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll ask my boyfriend to drive you to the hospital if necessary. You can't break down. After all, your whole family needs you to earn money to take care of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley firmly believed that Natalie's words were simply nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was just an insignificant store manager with a monthly salary of at most 30 or 40 thousand dollars. How could she have become the exclusive agent of the brand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on Natalie's salary, it would be impossible for her to amass such a fortune even if she lived several lifetimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hadley, stop talking nonsense to her. Had we known that she had mental problems, we shouldn't have come here," Noel remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley continued, "Natalie, I really want to know how you came up with this bragging method to show off in front of me. Do you really think I'm a three-year-old child with no capacity for discernment whatsoever?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea of how much it costs to acquire the exclusive agency rights and eight stores from a brand? The sum might scare you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie wasn't inclined to engage in an argument. Without further ado, she directly pulled out her mobile phone, opened the electronic versions of the acquisition contract and the brand's authorization letter, and presented them to Hadley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley narrowed her eyes, took her phone, and read the documents carefully for a </span><span>while. In an instant, her eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they really the acquisition contract and the brand's authorization letter? How is this possible? How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley trembled as if struck by lightning, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply couldn't imagine how Natalie, a small store manager, could make it and what she had experienced in the past two years.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
