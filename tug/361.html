  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that, apart from Crankhurst, no other country in the world was worth mentioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Uswad, a country that had been defeated by Crankhurst, was even less significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Griffin, that is not right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace could not take it anymore. She stood up and said, "Uswad's 5,000-year-old culture is well-recognized worldwide as one of the oldest civilizations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only has Uswad never borrowed from Crankhurstian culture, but Crankhurst has been learning from us. Your language, food, and history still bear traces of Uswadic influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the war you mentioned, although Crankhurst was the aggressor, in the end, it was Uswad that triumphed. A great country like Uswad could never be defeated by a small island nation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, Mr. Fitzgerald's medical skills are not something anyone can easily question. He cured my leukemia. If you do not believe me, Ms. Griffin, you can find someone in Crankhurst who can do the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can, I will admit that Crankhurst's healthcare system is better than ours. But if you cannot, please do not casually judge another country's affairs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's words were firm and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She completely countered Charlotte's biased comments about Uswad, and every point she made was logical and well-supported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Marcus could not help but look at Grace with new respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, his impression of Grace had been limited to her severe leukemia and near-coma state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had not expected her words to be so sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlotte's face turned pale with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to say something, but saw Terry wave his hand at her and then said, "Ms. Mitchell, you are indeed the daughter of Mayor Benjamin. I admire your eloquence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uswad and Crankhurst are distant relatives and close neighbors. The wars of the past are long over, and there is no need to bring them up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I do have something I would like to ask Mayor Benjamin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin raised an eyebrow and asked, "Mr. Griffin , what would you like to ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you go out earlier to pick up Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Benjamin nodded, not wanting to go into the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Zane could not hold back and sneered, "Even if this person is the one who saved Ms. Mitchell, Mayor Benjamin, you made us wait here for two hours. Is this how you treat your guests?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlotte also sneered, "Ha, I was just about to say that. Ms. Mitchell does not even realize her mistake. She keeps calling Uswad a great nation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can a country claim to be great when it does not even know basic etiquette?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I still doubt whether this person is truly as capable as you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words from the Griffin family became increasingly harsh, each one more cutting than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps they were upset by the long wait due to Marcus, and now they were targeting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's expression darkened further. He addressed the four of them, saying, "First, I apologize for the two-hour wait. I failed to attend to you properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this matter has nothing to do with Mr. Fitzgerald. There is no need for personal attacks. You are all esteemed guests, and I do not wish for any unpleasantness in my home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry responded, "Mayor Benjamin, we are just stating the facts. We do not want any conflict."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlotte's point is simple. In Crankhurst, we respect the expert. If this person is worth our two-hour wait, we have no complaints," Zane said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if the person we waited for is just a nobody, then waiting for two hours would have been a waste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry's words were sharp, his gaze fixed on Marcus with a hint of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Griffin, what exactly are you trying to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin asked, his frown deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense that the Griffin family was deliberately stirring trouble. He thought, "If I do not handle this carefully, they will not let it go easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is no patient here to demonstrate medical skills, but I have heard that Uswadic Martial Arts have been passed down for thousands of years. Many Uswadic men practice martial arts from a young age," Terry said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would Mr. Fitzgerald be willing to spar with Easton and show us some of Uswadic's unique martial arts? We would like to see it for ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane smiled, his tone laced with a hidden agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Easton was a 9th-dan black belt in Karate, a former national champion in Crankhurst, and a formidable opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane had said this to make Marcus look bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Grace immediately spoke up to stop them. "Mr. Zane Griffin, Easton introduced himself as a 9th-dan black belt champion. How can Mr. Fitzgerald possibly compare? It would be unfair to ask him to spar."</span></p><div class="pagination">
