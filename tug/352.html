  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine Wilson listened intently, her expression thoughtful. After a moment, her cheeks turned a deep shade of pink. She shot Marcus a playful glare. "Mr. Fitzgerald, how do you say things like that without even flinching?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your words always make me shy"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't look like one getting all shy," Marcus replied with a smirk. "Seems like you're enjoying it quite a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine huffed, her small fists landing lightly on his chest. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you're impossible! You just love teasing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, another reaction? Let's go again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could sense the sensation rising again in his clone body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Catherine's naked form and he felt his emotions surge. The intensity of the connection was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giving in to the moment, Marcus leaned down and kissed her deeply, spreading her legs open again and guiding himself inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you liar! You don't have the refractory period at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine threw his small fists onto his chest to protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled but didn't give her a chance to continue. He quickened his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And because it was their second time, his movements became more confident, more intense, as the moment deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine, her loud moans giving way to soft sighs and her body relaxing fully as the connection consumed her, surrendered herself to the flow, which sent her to the peak several times. Afterward, she collapsed against the seat, falling into a deep, peaceful sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concerned about the chilly sea breeze, Marcus carried her to a nearby hotel to keep her warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with all the excitement, Catherine remained fast asleep, her expression calm and serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Catherine resting, Marcus turned his attention to training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His relentless dedication to refining his skills, combined with a steady devour of pills, finally propelled him to the fifth stage of Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This breakthrough marked a pivotal moment. His combat strength had more than doubled since his peak at the stage four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Progress in Ancient Martial Arts grew exponentially harder with each stage, but the rewards were equally significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking through to the fifth stage was a milestone that Marcus knew would give him an edge far beyond his previous capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my martial arts at stage five, my magic nearing level four, and my key abilities&mdash;Celestial Reversal, X-ray Vision, and Devouring Power&mdash;I can stand toe-to-toe with experts of the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe even hold my own against a stage-six opponent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus mused, his confidence growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the information he'd gathered, Phoenix Morris, the leader of the Astral Serpent Order, one of the three great martial sects in Uswad, was an Ancient Martial Stage Six expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus realized his current strength now placed him among the elite of Uswad's martial world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he didn't let pride cloud his perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew all too well that many powerful figures remained hidden, their strength far surpassing what the world knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This concept is also documented in the latter half of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the text, the nine stages of Ancient Martial Arts cultivation are collectively known as the Foundation Establishment stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Foundation Establishment was merely a starting point, what unimaginable heights lay beyond?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a thrill through Marcus' mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond his ambitions to inherit the position of Godfather, Marcus' deepest longing was to ascend to the pinnacle of martial mastery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To reach the ultimate stage of Ancient Martial Arts would mean standing above all others, claiming the title of the world's true sovereign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... Why am I here? What happened last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's groggy voice broke his thoughts the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled gently. "You were exhausted. After our second round, you fell asleep. I didn't want you to catch a cold by the ocean, so I brought you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh," Catherine murmured, memories of the previous night flooding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed as she avoided his gaze. "Mr. Fitzgerald, this is all your fault! If you hadn't insisted on a second round, I wouldn't have been so wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened as she glanced at the clock. "It's 9 AM! Today's my first day at Sync Group, and I'm already late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Springing into action, Catherine dashed into the bathroom for a quick shower before returning to get dressed and do her makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why the rush?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked with a smirk, watching her scramble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I'm the General Manager. I need to set an example! If I'm always late, how am I supposed to manage the rest of the staff?" Catherine said firmly as she worked on her light makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, impressed at the girl's managerial abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her sense of responsibility and determination, she had the potential to become an exceptional leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within ten minutes, Catherine had finished getting ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with minimal makeup, her natural features made her look stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drove her to the Sync Group Solomia headquarters in the Aston Martin before heading back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he walked into his room, his phone buzzed with a call from Michelle Smith.</span></p><div class="pagination">
