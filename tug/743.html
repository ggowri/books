  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swept his gaze across the crowd, sneering, "If anyone else has a problem with my presence here, step right up. I'll gladly deal with each one of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd exchanged nervous glances, and those at Marcus' power level didn't dare speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for those at higher levels, like the silver-haired youth, they merely gave Marcus a dismissive glance before looking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps in their eyes, even though Marcus had defeated the middle-aged man, he still posed no threat to their status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His current show of arrogance was nothing but self-satisfaction to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice called out from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked toward the source and saw a man in his fifties emerging from the layers of white mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man exuded an overwhelming aura. Each casual step he took gave off an awe-inspiring presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carried an ancient sword with a faint sword aura swirling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than the Swords Sect patriarch, Liam Sky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be Patriarch Liam of the Swords Sect?" Marcus asked coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam nodded with a warm smile. "Indeed, that would be me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Liam a respectful bow. "It's an honor to meet you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you should have told me you were coming. I would have sent someone down the mountain to escort you," Liam said pleasantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "The place wasn't too hard to find, so I didn't want to trouble you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers watched this exchange with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had expected Liam to treat Marcus with such courtesy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This further confirmed that Marcus was no ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, everyone noticed the silver-haired youth rise from the boulder and walk toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He addressed Liam, "Patriarch, may I ask who this is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam smiled as he introduced Marcus. "Nathan, this is Mr. Marcus Fitzgerald, a rising star in the Ancient Martial Art world of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. His talent is extraordinary, and his power formidable. I specifically invited him to join us in exploring the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan Caster gave Marcus a dismissive look before addressing Liam. "You've invited several people below Ancient Martial Stage Seven. In my opinion, those at that level cannot safely approach the space-time gate's core. Without power, at least at Stage Seven, it's practically suicide. So regardless of his talent, he doesn't belong here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan took another contemptuous glance at Marcus as he spoke these words, not trying to hide his disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's expression darkened at Nathan's bluntness, and he tried to catch his eye with a warning look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan ignored Liam's signal and was about to turn away when a voice rang out nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lady Ada has arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As those words echoed, eyes lit up across the crowd as everyone turned toward the entrance of the Illusion Rune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burst of light suddenly appeared there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that brilliant glow, an enchanting figure emerged into everyone's view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved with ethereal grace, radiating an otherworldly purity that seemed untouched by mortal concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single glance left an unforgettable impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Ada, renowned as the most beautiful woman in the World of Ancient Martial Arts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> Ada came too. She really is as stunning as they say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God, she's gorgeous. I've never seen anyone this beautiful before. One chance to get close to her would make my whole life worthwhile!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regular folks like us shouldn't get our hopes up. A beauty like that is way out of our league!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's arrival set off a wave of excited chatter among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gazed at her with undisguised admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ancient Martial Stage Seven! Ada has advanced to Ancient Martial Stage Seven! That's incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice suddenly rang out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did people notice that Ada had indeed advanced her cultivation to the Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the World of Ancient Martial Arts, reaching Ancient Martial Stage Seven meant joining the ranks of true elite masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Ada stunningly beautiful, but she had also reached the pinnacle of martial prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the definition of perfection. Who wouldn't be drawn to a woman like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's eyes brightened at Ada's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caught the look of admiration and desire in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Nathan had unique feelings for Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada glided forward with graceful steps, walking quickly toward Marcus and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's face lit up with joy as he greeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ada didn't even glance his way, instead walking straight to Marcus in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stunning face bore a rare smile as she said, "I didn't expect you to arrive so quickly. Had I known, I would have hurried here myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Ada to know Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And from her behavior, it seemed she was already quite familiar with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd even ignored Nathan to greet Marcus first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Nathan's brows furrow deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just arrived myself," Marcus said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected such warmth from Ada this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she'd always been hostile toward him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The change in her attitude was evident to anyone watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect timing then. Let's team up when we head to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate," Ada suggested to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since their last parting, she'd had time to think about many things, including her relationship with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus had once forcefully claimed her, he had rescued her from dire situations more than once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had fought against the three guardians of the Bloodthirsty Cult to save her, helping her break free from the Blood Curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that battle, Ada's opinion of Marcus changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she interacted with Marcus, the more Ada realized he wasn't the villain she'd initially thought him to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she discovered he was a man who took responsibility and stood by his principles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, his power was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Ada had always been strong-willed and independent, an actual alpha female type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, all women were attracted to strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada couldn't help but feel something special for a powerful, responsible, and dependable man like Marcus,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, during their time apart, Ada thought of Marcus every night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body would flush with heat whenever she recalled their passionate encounters, and an overwhelming desire would stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her question whether she had always been this passionate by nature.</span></p><div class="pagination">
