  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Jeremy as if he were an idiot and, in a tone that dripped with disdain, said, "Since you don't believe me, I'll just call the HR department at the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park and cancel your job offer right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus picked up the phone and dialed the number for the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's face was filled with mockery as he turned to Marcus. "Stop that. Do you really think I'm going to fall for your lies? Who do you think you are ordering around the HR department of Golden Group's Pharmaceutical Industrial Park? This is hilarious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said nothing and just stared silently at Jeremy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of his gaze sent a chill down Jeremy's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shannon, I think it's time to wrap up this meal. There's no point in talking to such an unreliable young man. He really thinks that just because he has a little money, he can boss around Golden Group. I'm embarrassed for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle chimed in with a mocking tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could say more, Jeremy's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, Jeremy answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're from Golden Group's Pharmaceutical Industrial Park HR department. Is this Mr. Keyes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy immediately wiped the smirk off his face and straightened up, becoming respectful. He nodded vigorously, speaking in a serious tone, "Yes, this is Jeremy Keyes. How may I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm calling on behalf of the HR department to inform you that your job offer has been canceled formally. We hope to have the chance to work with you in the future. Goodbye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call ended before Jeremy could respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy was left stunned, his mind spinning in disbelief. He couldn't process what had just happened, his face frozen in shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way... How could this happen? My job offer was really canceled? How could this be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sank to his knees, muttering to himself as his gaze turned murderous. "Tell me, did you and the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park HR department frame me? Otherwise, how could they have canceled my offer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just smiled indifferently, "People like you aren't worth my time, and I can't be bothered to frame you. Don't overestimate your importance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's face turned a deep shade of fury, his mind reeling. He never imagined that Marcus could actually cancel his offer with a single phone call. It was simply unbelievable to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Kyle, Penny, and Shannon were left stunned by the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus made the call, Shannon thought he was simply bluffing, but what had just transpired left her brain completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Golden Group was a top-tier company in Solomia. She couldn't believe Marcus actually knew anyone from the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You country bumpkin, don't get too smug. Even if I can't join Golden Group, with my parents' connections in the pharmaceutical industry, I can still land another high-paying job. If worse comes to worst, I could join BioFusion Pharmaceuticals and still get a top salary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy turned to Marcus with a cold stare. However, his words were more like he was trying to comfort himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he seemed to regain a little of his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and asked, "Your father is the head of the design department at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something was wrong with t</span><span>he Design Department at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had ordered a batch of products there and noticed design flaws in the pharmaceutical production lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His company's after-sales team had been there several times because of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To fix the problem, they replaced numerous parts and invested considerable time and resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a large, publicly listed company, such a mistake was simply unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Marcus had suspected that the head of the design department was involved in some way. There was no way such a huge mistake could have happened otherwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had even discussed the issue with Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had agreed with his assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the head of the design department, along with his wife, had worked at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals for years and had formed a network of collaborators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people weren't just guilty of faulty designs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been involved in corruption, accepting bribes and using their positions to offer favors to others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every one of these offenses was enough to warrant immediate dismissal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, because there were a lot of people involved, Josie had yet to announce the decision to fire the department head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been gathering evidence and looking for a better replacement. Once she had enough proof, she'd be able to take swift action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy raised his eyebrows and asked, "What, are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a small, almost pitying smile. "Let me tell you something. My parents make tens of million dollars a year, and besides their salary, they had other sources of income. Trust me, they could support my family for generations without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And their income is stable. You, on the other hand, are nothing more than a flash in the pan. You are just a nobody compared to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Jeremy with an almost disdainful expression. "Oh, your parents have other sources of income? What might that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's face stiffened, and he immediately tried to deflect. "That's none of your business, you country bumpkin! Keep your mouth shut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't need to investigate further. The look in Jeremy's eyes told him everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew those "other sources of income" were almost certainly dirty money, exactly what Josie had told him about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Jeremy's attempt at deflection, Marcus dialed Josie's number.</span></p><div class="pagination">
