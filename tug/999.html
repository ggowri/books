  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when she was separated from Marcus, Ada would subconsciously recall the passionate moments they had in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was well-known that Ada had been a virtuous woman in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had preserved her chastity for more than a hundred years, always being pure in heart and abstinent in desires, and never having contact with any man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since having slept with Marcus once, Ada felt as if she had lost her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did she think of Marcus' handsome figure, but also the ambiguous scenes between the two of them kept emerging in her mind, which had distracted her a lot recently, making her unable to concentrate on her cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told Marcus that she was worried that Gertie would come to cause trouble for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in fact, she couldn't suppress her longing for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The longing in her heart had already reached a point where she couldn't bear it. So, taking this opportunity, Ada came to Solomia again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the pretty face of Ada, Marcus suddenly felt a little guilty in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said awkwardly, "Don't worry. I won't take it to heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uttering these words made Marcus feel more guilty towards Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada still didn't know that Gertie had been forcefully taken advantage of by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at the thought of how arrogant Gertie was before, Marcus felt better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In light of what Gertie had done to Marcus, he would have caught her and made her a sex slave if he hadn't considered the relationship between Gertie and Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're so kind..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus so magnanimous, Ada felt that she loved him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with the intense longing in her heart, Ada could no longer suppress her feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her face directly and kissed Marcus' lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time that Ada took the initiative to kiss Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the initial hatred towards Marcus for having her chastity taken away, to being forced to submit halfway, to now being completely subdued by Marcus' charm, her change was obvious to the naked eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Marcus should have a very strong reaction and be extremely happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, perhaps because he thought of the fact that he had just taken advantage of Gertie, Marcus felt a bit of resistance towards Ada at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His resistance wasn't because he didn't like her anymore, but stemmed from his guilt towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But women were very sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus' resistance this time was subtle, Ada still sensed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her head again and looked at Marcus, asking, "Marcus, what's wrong with you? Are you not feeling well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head a little awkwardly and said, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do I feel that you have something on your mind? Or are you tired of me and don't like me anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada said, and at the end of her sentence, her beautiful eyes even turned slightly red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the first time she had been so proactive towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus seemed absent-minded, which hurt Ada's feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought that Marcus might not like her anymore gave her heart a sharp pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's not true. Don't be paranoid, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the wronged look of Ada, Marcus suddenly felt bad. He stroked her cheek and soothed her, "Who else would I like if not you? After all, you're so charming and understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his words, Ada pouted and said, "Why didn't you make a move on me? I guess I've lost your interest now. Men are all fickle in affection, abandoning the old for the new. The words you said to me before were all lies, weren't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a sense of crisis, Ada held Marcus' arm even tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Marcus would leave her as soon as she let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please stop being so paranoid, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to love me and ravish me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, Ada waved her hand. Bursts of rune energy gushed from her palm and quickly enveloped the surrounding area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the space in this area became illusory, and everything else disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the two of them came to an antique-style room.</span></p><div class="pagination">
