  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman said coldly, her gaze toward Morgana filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana frowned and replied, "I was sleeping and didn't hear you knocking."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman snorted coldly and mocked, "It's already past nine, and you're still pretending to sleep? Lying to me, huh? Looks like you've grown bold enough to talk back to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana rolled her eyes impatiently and asked, "I don't want to argue with you. Just tell me, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman said bluntly, "It's the 15th today, you should've gotten your salary, right? Of course, I'm here for the money. Why even ask? Hurry up and hand it over!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just gave you ten thousand dollars last week, didn't I? Why are you asking for money again? I want to keep this month's salary for living expenses," Morgana said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This middle-aged woman was Morgana's stepmother, Faith.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Morgana was six, her mother passed away, and her father quickly married Faith.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, her father and Faith had a younger brother.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith had always treated Morgana poorly, often beating and scolding her, and even denying her enough food.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially when Morgana's father was not home, Faith would intensify her abuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the good things in the house were reserved for Morgana's brother, while she could only get a little depending on Faith's mood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for Morgana's father insisting, Morgana might not even have had the chance to go to school according to Faith's wishes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Faith was not a kind person and left a deep shadow on Morgana's childhood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few years ago, Morgana's father passed away, and Faith, along with her son, took over all the property left by Morgana's father.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Morgana's brother got married, he stopped taking care of Faith.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith took part of the money left by Morgana's father and married another man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spent every day either gambling or hanging out with that man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's worse, Faith often came to Morgana asking for money under the pretense of taking care of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana was just Faith's stepdaughter and was often abused by her as a child. Even her father's inheritance was taken over by Faith.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith even had a biological son, but she never asked him for money and instead kept demanding money from Morgana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whenever Morgana refused, Faith would cause trouble at her house or even create a scene at her school.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To avoid affecting her work, Morgana sometimes had to compromise and give Faith some money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unexpectedly, this only made Faith even more excessive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recently, Faith has been demanding money more and more frequently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last week, Morgana just gave her $10,000, but a few days later, she came back asking for more, acting all self-righteous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you keeping any living expenses? I'm old now, unable to work, and you need to support me! Got it? Hurry up and give me another $10,000!" Faith said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I already told you, I just gave you $10,000 last week. There's no way I'm giving you more this week. Besides, don't you have a biological son? Why don't you ask him for money?" Faced with Faith's endless pestering, Morgana finally lost her temper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Smack!" Before the words were finished, Faith suddenly slapped Morgana across the face, leaving half of her face instantly red and swollen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you talk back? You grew up without a mother. If I hadn't raised you, would you even be alive today? Now you don't know how to be grateful, do you? If you don't give me money, I'll sue you in court and make a scene at your principal's house!" Faith threatened aggressively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps due to the impact of childhood trauma, Morgana would involuntarily tremble every time she saw Faith, especially when Faith was angry, as a deep sense of fear engulfed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she covered her swollen face, her eyes red, and clenched her teeth as she fought back, "I was raised by my dad when I was a kid. When did you ever truly take care of me? All you did was hit me and abuse me. And now you have the nerve to ask me for money? Let me tell you, I</span><span>'</span><span>m not giving you a cent today. Go ahead and sue me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
