  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda's face was etched with worry as she urged Marcus to leave immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't budge an inch, casually lounging in his chair and smoking a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel thumped his cane in frustration, looking utterly disappointed. "Just look at this! How did the Lewis family end up with a piece of work like this? Couldn't pick up anything useful, but sure learned how to fight and kill. What a damn shame!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Billy was making a call to Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, Jalen split his time between studying the Magic Codex Marcus had given him and expanding their territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He happened to be in a town near Yolanda Village, bringing a small gang under their control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he got Billy's call, Jalen's blood began to boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Tory's death, numerous small gangs had been challenging Serpent's Coil's authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen was already in a foul mood about this, and now someone had the nerve to attack their people! He couldn't just sit back and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he rounded up over a hundred of his men and headed straight for Yolanda Village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Billy got Jalen's confirmation, he sneered at Marcus. "Since you know Mr. Zafer's name, you should know what he's capable of. When he gets here, getting beaten up will be the least of your worries. Better tell your family to prepare your funeral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just let out a cold laugh, showing no concern. "What I can't figure out is how you guys got mixed up with Jonathan and his crew. Last I checked, Serpent's Coil had no business dealings with Solomia Construction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the shadow leader of Serpent's Coil, Marcus had spotted something fishy, but he'd been too swamped with other matters to oversee everything personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, once he noticed a problem, it needed fixing fast. After all, significant disasters often started as tiny cracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah, like someone like you could ever understand how Serpent's Coil operates. Save your breath. Mr. Zafer will be here any minute! You better start praying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Billy sneered, his face dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan and Paul could barely contain their excitement, eagerly awaiting Jalen's arrival to take care of that worthless Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within five minutes, a fleet of luxury vehicles came roaring down the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen stepped out of his car, surrounded by his entourage. His black trench coat only added to his intimidating presence, which commanded attention without effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Zafer, thank god you're here! Some idiot had the nerve to mess with Mr. Whitby. I only dared to call you because I know you and Mr. Whitby are close friends!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Billy said with an exaggerated bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen gave him a dismissive glance before turning to Jonathan. "Next time you need something, call me directly. No need to go through my guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan's eyes lit up at those words. "With Mr. Zafer backing me, I'd like to see anyone in Solomia try to mess with me again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, who's this person who crossed you? I want to see this fool who doesn't know their place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan pointed towards Marcus and said, "That's the guy right there. Take him down for me, Mr. Zafer. Don't worry about the money! I might be fired, but I've got enough saved up to make it worth your while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen waved dismissively. "He attacked our Serpent's Coil members. I was going to deal with him anyway, teach him what happens when you mess with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jalen spoke, he turned his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his eyes fell on Marcus, he froze on the spot, nearly fainting. "Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jalen, how's your training coming along? I told you I'd test you in a week. You've got three days left. Why are you here instead of practicing?" Marcus said sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan, seeing Marcus speak to Jalen this way, sneered, "You've got some nerve talking to Mr. Zafer like that. You'll regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jonathan could finish, Jalen kicked his balls hard and snapped, "Shut your mouth! Who are you to disrespect Mr. Fitzgerald? I'll deal with you later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan collapsed in pain, rolling on the ground and howling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood there dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could believe Jalen's bizarre behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, to their utter shock, Jalen dropped to his knees before Marcus, his voice trembling. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I haven't forgotten your teachings. I've memorized every word of the Magic Codex you gave me. I'm only here to absorb a small gang! Please don't be angry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started bowing repeatedly, so forcefully that his forehead began to bleed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What in the world was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could Jalen be bowing to this nobody?</span></p><div class="pagination">
