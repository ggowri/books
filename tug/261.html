  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two elders had Stage Two cultivation, yet they could not withstand the pressure Marcus casually released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could hardly imagine what kind of strength Marcus had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cooke was stunned, and his gaze toward Marcus grew even more respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I have the right to bring him in?" Marcus asked the two elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders trembled and quickly nodded. "Please forgive our arrogance. You only need to pay one billion </span><span>Uswad</span><span> dollars each to enter the Southern Market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus was young, his cultivation far surpassed theirs, so showing respect to Marcus was not too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do in Rome as Rome does. Marcus did not make a scene. He took out two billion checks and handed them to the elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please follow me," one of the elders said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group entered the forest, and soon, a simple yet ancient altar appeared ahead. The altar was covered with carvings of dragons and phoenixes, along with many strange patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The altar was wrapped in vines, making it undetectable from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the guidance of the elders, Marcus and Cooke ascended the altar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two elders chanted an obscure spell, the altar glowed brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Cooke felt enveloped by a spatial force and the rainforest scene before they disappeared, replaced by a brand-new world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The noisy and chaotic sounds reached Marcus, who realized he was now on a bustling and prosperous street. Passers-by passed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stores lined both sides of the street, all selling various energy crystals and treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the small vendors on the street sold all kinds of raw stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the raw material wholesale market in Spring City, the raw materials here emitted faint energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some high-quality raw stones released energy that illuminated the surrounding areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, this is the Southern Market. It's been over a decade since I last came, and its scale has grown even larger," Cooke said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Cooke's cultivation, he was not qualified to enter the Southern Market. Before meeting Marcus, he thought he would never be able to be here again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked around. This place was more like a small city than a market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the main street, other streets were also well-connected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Restaurants, bars, game centers, clothing stores, and various entertainment venues were all available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, except for the original residents of the Southern Market, the guests coming here must have cultivation at Ancient Martial Stage Two or above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, the Southern Market was equivalent to a city exclusively for warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus roughly estimated that there were hundreds of thousands of people here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, not all of them were from </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. There were also people from </span><span>Southvaia</span><span> and other countries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sheer number of people was enough to shock Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he had a chance to learn martial arts, warriors were only mentioned in legends for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he thought this group was extremely mysterious and rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the current scene was somewhat beyond his imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"High-quality energy crystals on sale at low prices. Don't miss out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a shout came from not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' attention was drawn. He saw a young man in his twenties shouting energetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stall was filled with various energy crystals, outnumbering other stalls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was attracted and walked over, with Cooke following closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They arrived at the stall. Seeing the pile of energy crystals, Marcus gave up on selecting them himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released his consciousness and casually probed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found that the energy crystals at this stall were generally not very high in grade, and the stored energy was quite limited, even inferior to the ordinary energy crystal Diana had embedded in her gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much do you sell them?" Marcus casually asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man glanced at Marcus and said, "It depends on the quality you want. Each quality has a different price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus picked up a piece of energy crystal that looked decent and asked, "How much is this crystal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to sell this for one hundred million each, but now I'm selling it at a discount for 50 million," the young man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gasped upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This crystal looked the size of a palm, but the usable part was only as big as a fingernail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the energy contained was not abundant, only enough to power the energy release of an ordinary gun. And it cost 50 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At such a cost, if he wanted to form an army, the money required would be huge, something Marcus could not afford at present.</span></p><div class="pagination">
