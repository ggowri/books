  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, the news that Haley, the heir of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, had been shot swept across Solomia, causing a strong shock, and all major media outlets rushed to report on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were rumors that Haley had been shot dead after a conflict with someone in a nightclub, but the specific details were not disclosed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the name of the nightclub could not be verified, and there was very little information that could be found online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some netizens posted photos of the scene in the comment section, but they were all deleted within seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people even speculated that the specific information was deliberately blocked, which meant that the murderer must be someone extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were rumors that Leo, from the Brown family in Kingston, had also been present but still failed to save Haley's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the cemetery, Jared, who had one hand chopped off, had a face full of grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "My son was only 25 years old and had a great time enjoying his youth, but he died in such an unclear manner. I will never let it go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Leo came over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared raised his head and said, "Mr. Brown, my son died unjustly. Please, Mr. Brown, avenge my son's death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the murderer was Marcus, but he knew that it would be difficult to avenge Haley with his own strength alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Jared placed all his hopes on the Brown family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's eyes were filled with hatred, and he said, "Don't worry. I won't let Haley die in vain. A country bumpkin from Solomia dared to do that to me. When I return to Kingston, I will report this to my family, and that country bumpkin will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Jared regained hope of revenge, thinking, "The power of the Brown family in Kingston is superior to any other force in Solomia. Even if Marcus has the support of the Golden Group, he's doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After killing Haley, Marcus already guessed the impending revenge of the Brown family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was not afraid, thinking, "Counter move for move. I'll never regret anything I do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, how could I tolerate Haley and Leo molesting my woman in public?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, Marcus had been busy with the construction of a pharmaceutical company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Michelle's help, Marcus contacted the most authoritative construction company in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The construction company promised that the factory building could be completed within three months, and it could be produced simultaneously if all the equipment was in place during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The total construction cost was one billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus first paid the construction company five hundred million dollars in start-up capital, and the remaining five hundred million dollars would be paid after qualified acceptance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Marcus secretly transferred the position of legal representative of the Golden Group to Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, he no longer had anything to do with the Golden Group on the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he was still the boss behind the scenes, and doing so was more conducive to developing his power in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, everyone knew that the loftiest tree was the most dreaded thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After signing the contract with the construction company, the only thing Marcus should do was purchase the equipment and obtain production qualifications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus found Charles to solve these problems, who was not only a famous professor of internal medicine in Bayside but also had experience in running a pharmaceutical company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that Marcus was going to start a pharmaceutical company, Charles felt admiration and expressed his full support for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles obtained the full medical qualifications for the pharmaceutical company in less than three days, which meant that the company could produce any kind of medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such production qualifications were difficult to obtain, and Charles had relied on a lot of connections to get it done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Charles' recommendation, Marcus also gained a preliminary understanding of the pharmaceutical production line, which was generally monopolized by Weston Land countries under normal circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in recent years, a pharmaceutical production line company called BioFusion Pharmaceuticals located in Kingston emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than three years, it achieved first place in Uswad's market share.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their production lines were not only cost-effective but also as good as those of Weston Land countries in terms of performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Marcus planned to visit BioFusion Pharmaceuticals in Kingston in the next few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back to Bayside Villa from Charles' home, Marcus received a call from Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I've been kidnapped. Don't come. They want to kill you." Natalia's voice was tearful and urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned and was about to speak, but Natalia hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hurriedly called back, but Natalia's phone was always busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Natalia sent a location to Marcus with a message: [Get here within five hours, or you'll be waiting to collect her body.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was located in a barren mountain outside Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hurriedly opened the map to check. Vast mountains surrounded the location, and it was sparsely populated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought, "It seems that Natalia is indeed in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus turned the car around and headed towards the airport, directly purchasing a flight ticket with the nearest flight time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two hours, he landed at Kingston Airport. He hailed a taxi and went directly to the location Natalia had sent him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Kingston, the sky was dark today, covered with dark clouds. And the air was humid and depressing, just like Marcus' mood at the moment, which might explode at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus got out of the taxi, he found two people waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to save Natalia, obey us." With that, one of them took out a pair of handcuffs and waved them in front of Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
