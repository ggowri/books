  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire process took about two hours to complete.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This cultivation session propelled Marcus's cultivation from Acquired State Six directly to the peak of Acquired State Six.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just three days ago, he had barely broken through the State, and now he had done it again. Such cultivation speed could no longer be described as "terrifying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the Acquired State, each cultivation improvement has an extremely significant impact on one's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Marcus felt his combat power had undergone a tremendous transformation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After spending another half hour stabilizing the State, Marcus slowly retracted the Timeless Numinous Energy and exhaled a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his body was covered in a layer of black liquid, emitting a foul stench.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew this was the impurities expelled from his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through this Dual Cultivation with Morgana and the breakthrough in cultivation, he finally eliminated these impurities completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After expelling the impurities, Marcus felt his energy channels were smoother than ever, and his whole body felt light and refreshed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the slumbering Morgana slowly woke up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps the previous pleasure was too intense, causing her to temporarily lose her memory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her naked state, Morgana panicked and quickly pulled the blanket to cover herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shyly asked, "What happened? Did we just..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she recalled the intimate moments with Marcus, her cheeks instantly flushed with a shy redness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you remember?" Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I remember... but weren't we treating a stomachache? How did it suddenly turn into that?" Morgana asked shyly, her delicate appearance resembling a freshly bloomed rose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Naturally, we couldn't help but be attracted to each other," Marcus said with a smile, gently pulling the blanket covering Morgana. She let out a startled cry, "You... what are you trying to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus joked, "I've already seen everything. What's the point of covering up?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana bit her lip lightly, looking at her bare body, and couldn't help but recall the passionate moments with Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My body already belongs to you. How should we get along in the future?" Morgana couldn't help but ask, her gaze carrying a hint of anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't mind, from now on, you're my woman," Marcus said, his muscles exuding an irresistible masculine charm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without intentionally looking at him, Morgana still found his physique incredibly attractive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will you abandon me in the future?" Morgana seemed to lack a sense of security.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, her mind was clouded by desire, but now, upon regaining clarity, she realized their relationship had progressed too quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had only known each other for a day before having sex, which even she found unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you're willing to stay by my side, I will never leave you," Marcus said, pulling Morgana into his arms and gently stroking her hair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling his broad chest, Morgana's heart was filled with contentment. At this moment, she vaguely felt that the man before her was someone she could entrust her life to.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Morgana's delicate face, Marcus could no longer hold back and kissed her red lips again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana's body trembled as if electrified, and after a brief struggle, she gave in once more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Marcus gently pressed Morgana beneath him, initiating a new round of intimacy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That night, they experienced three intense unions, only calming down when utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Exhausted, Morgana fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early the next morning, both were still asleep but were startled awake by a sudden, urgent knocking at the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is it!" Morgana, startled, quickly dressed and opened the door, only to see a plump, heavily made-up middle-aged woman standing at the doorway, glaring at her coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She scolded angrily, "What are you doing? I've been knocking for so long, and you didn't respond. Are you deaf?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
