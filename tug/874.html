  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay, it's all me. You didn't ask, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded helplessly without arguing with Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he directly picked up her tempting delicate body from the bed, causing Jade to let out a cry of surprise, "Marcus, what are you doing? Where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a smile, "Of course, it's to take a shower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's pretty face turned red as she said, "Then you won't do that kind of thing again, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head and said, "Don't worry, I won't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not long after the two entered the bathroom, Jade's extremely enchanting moans could be heard again from inside the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, the two made love three times, each lasting over an hour and a half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Jade sore all over the next day and unwilling to get out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all your fault. I'm in so much pain..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's face showed a hint of pain as she glared at Marcus fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as she thought about the scenes from last night with Marcus, Jade felt an inexplicable urge in her heart again, and her lower body became slightly moist once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling of being unable to stop was extremely distressing for Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly couldn't bear it anymore, but for some reason, she was incredibly yearning for this sensation...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, Jade's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a call from an unknown number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She answered the phone politely, "Hello, this is Jade, the head of the surgery department at </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital. Who are you looking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Jason," came an aged voice from the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jade was sitting in Marcus' lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' large hand was constantly kneading Jade's plump breasts, causing her to involuntarily let out low, heavy panting sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the call was from the dean, Jade's expression immediately became tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly made a shushing gesture to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus withdraw his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lake, how can I assist you?" Jade asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carter, his voice filled with excitement, replied, "I'm calling to share some good news. </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> has informed our hospital that we are now the exclusive distributor of their patented drug. This means the drug will only be available through our hospital, and any other hospitals wishing to sell it must get authorization from us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The credit is all yours, and on behalf of the entire hospital staff, I want to thank you!" </span><span>Carter's voice was full of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, whenever their hospital wanted to obtain some of these special patented drugs, they had to depend on </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Often, these drugs were in short supply, greatly affecting the success rate of surgeries at their hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, thanks to Jade's efforts, their hospital had become the sole agent for this patented drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they no longer needed to worry about shortages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Carter had heard through the grapevine about what happened outside the restaurant that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He learned that Jade's boyfriend was the infamous Death and that Death was the behind-the-scenes boss of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carter understood that this was directly connected to Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lake, please don't say that. As an employee of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital, it's only natural for me to contribute to the hospital," Jade said with great politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given Ronald and his team's despicable actions, I've decided to dismiss Ronald and his entire team. You'll take over as the new Vice Director of the hospital!" Carter </span><span>continued,</span><span> his voice still filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade trembled as though struck by lightning upon hearing this, unable to believe what she had just heard. Her beautiful eyes were filled with disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
