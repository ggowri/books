  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was well aware of Regis and Garrick's ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana, in particular, immediately understood their intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, they had no valid grounds to oppose Regis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis once again ordered the police officers, "Arrest him and take him back to the station for interrogation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as everyone assumed Marcus was about to be whisked away to the police station, a voice rang out from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They glanced over, only to see a group of uniformed police officers hastening over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront was a tall, upright-looking man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Dustin from the Solomia Police Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis involuntarily narrowed his eyes and asked, "Dustin, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an icy face, Dustin glared at Regis and growled, "Regis, you almost got yourself into big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis' eyes narrowed further. Perplexed by Dustin's statement, he asked, "I'm handling a case within my jurisdiction. How could I get into big trouble? You're pulling my leg, aren't you, Dustin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it was inappropriate to disclose Marcus' identity in public, he leaned in and whispered a few words in Regis' ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refrained from revealing that Marcus was a special advisor, merely stating that he was someone the mayor of Solomia, Benjamin, treated with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Regis panicked, his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be? It's impossible. Dustin, you're joking, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis' heart raced wildly. He'd never in his wildest dreams imagined that Marcus could possess such a prestigious identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin replied, "Do I look like I'm joking? I received word from above and came to inform you. You'd better not cause a major catastrophe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his words, Regis became devastated, never expecting to have confronted such an important figure that even Benjamin respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simple as this statement was, Regis understood its weight all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin was the mayor of Solomia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a sub-provincial city, Solomia held significant sway in Uswad, ranking among the top ten cities in the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mayor of such a major metropolis typically wielded substantial power, and Benjamin was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even he had to respect Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis immediately realized how formidable Marcus' background might be, though it couldn't be revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being the chief of the Westpine Police Station, compared to such an important individual, Regis was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, beads of cold sweat formed on Regis' forehead, and his body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A profound sense of dread washed over him. Had Dustin not arrived in the nick of time, and had he laid a hand on Marcus, the consequences for him would have been dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, Garrick urged again, "Regis, why haven't you taken action yet? Hurry up and arrest this damn guy and take him back to the police station for interrogation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis' brows furrowed sharply, and without warning, he slapped Garrick across the face, sending him stumbling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In bewilderment, Garrick blurted out, "Regis, what's wrong with you? Why'd you hit me? Did you mistake me for someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, scarcely had Garrick finished speaking when Regis snapped, "Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "You almost made me offend a big shot I should never have crossed. I've warned you and Sebastien repeatedly to be low-key and not to be so arrogant, so as to avoid bringing trouble to the Faust family. But you wouldn't listen. You're constantly causing trouble and then expecting me to clean up after you. As police chief, I'm here to uphold </span><span>justice</span><span>, not to mop up your messes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words threw Garrick into a panic. He had no idea why Regis had suddenly changed so drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could </span><span>say anything</span><span>, Regis commanded, "Arrest the father and son for interrogation!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
