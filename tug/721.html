  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paid no heed to the astonished looks on the faces of the crowd and said to Hector in a composed manner, "I remember that you informed me last time that the annual output value of the newly developed underwater oil fields of Bayside Petroleum Company ranges from 30 to 40 billion dollars, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware that Marcus had detected his corrupt activities, Hector replied, "Yes, the oil and gas reserves in this underwater oil field are relatively low, and its potential for sustainable development is limited. An annual output value of 30 to 40 billion dollars represents the maximum achievable output."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a sneer and then played the recording of the conversation he had just had with Atlas. "</span><span>So</span><span> what's going on? Listen carefully!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat immediately broke out on Hector's forehead. He naturally recognized that the person speaking in the recording was Atlas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he got furious and rushed to Atlas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Atlas could react, Hector lashed out with a brutal kick to his stomach and growled ferociously, "Atlas, what on earth were you blabbing about? Didn't I make it clear to you not to chat about this matter with just anyone? You are such a big mouth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are such a loose-lipped fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glaring at Atlas, Hector had no place to vent his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Atlas fell to the floor, Hector grabbed him by the collar and lifted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he slapped Atlas on the face repeatedly, causing him to scream miserably and struggle desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being younger than Hector, Atlas was only 5.4 feet tall, whereas Hector was tall and muscular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the saying went, a burly physique meant great strength. Atlas was no match for Hector at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood immediately gushed out of Atlas' nose and mouth, and he was in an extremely pitiful state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you! I had high hopes for you. I promoted you, regarded you as my confidant, and even promised to give you 30% of the profits. All I wanted was for you to work hard for me, not to go around blabbing about my secrets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, you sold me out. You are fucking seeking death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Hector punched and kicked Atlas, trying to beat him to death here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Olson, please hear me out. This guy was intentionally trying to trick me. I accidentally let it slip. Please stop hitting me, or I will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas kept begging for mercy on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It immediately dawned on him that he had fallen into Marcus' trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Atlas' explanation irritated Hector even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snarled menacingly, "You're truly courting death. How dare you shift the blame onto Mr. Fitzgerald? My anger won't dissipate unless I destroy you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hector launched an even more violent attack on Atlas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas was black and blue all over, looking extremely wretched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene completely dumbfounded the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It never crossed their minds that Hector would show such respect to Marcus and even beat up his own right-hand man, Atlas, on account of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector ceased his assault only when fatigue overwhelmed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas was already dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Hector spun around and walked up to Marcus, begging, "Mr. Fitzgerald, greed drove me out of my mind before, so I had the thought of embezzling some of the company's funds. Considering my decades of service in the company, could you please give me a break this time? If you let me off, I'll surely work my hardest from now on to pay back your kindness. Please, Mr. Fitzgerald, have mercy on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector was a smart man. He understood that Marcus was already in possession of all the evidence regarding his embezzlement of the company's profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One word from Marcus could remove him from his position and send him to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unwilling to bear such a consequence, Hector began to plead for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at him and said icily, "While making the decision to embezzle the company's profits, you ought to have taken into account the potential consequences that awaited you down the line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he beckoned to the people behind Hector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also taken aback by what had happened before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Marcus gave the order, they promptly stepped forward and captured Hector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued, "Send him to the police station for investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Bayside Petroleum Company was a private-owned enterprise, the sum of money that Hector had embezzled was substantial, and he had already incurred criminal liability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sufficient evidence might lead him to life imprisonment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair was written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector had never expected that he would be in prison one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the early morning, he had still envisioned money pouring into his pocket ceaselessly when the underwater oil field would be officially operational.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, by the afternoon, it all turned to dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost all his money and was about to face a life-long prison sentence. What a wretched situation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vance family was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they finally understood that Bayside Petroleum Company, a renowned oil behemoth in East </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, was, in fact, an enterprise under Marcus' control.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
