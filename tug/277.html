  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus texted: [I was in the southwest region of Uswad. The signal there was poor, and I was swamped, so I didn't message you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina: [Then come out. I'm right at your doorstep.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina's response took Marcus by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus: [My doorstep? Which doorstep?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina: [Isn't Bayside Villa your home?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina's message was followed by a playful emoji.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus rubbed his temples, never expecting her to come to Solomia to find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He put aside his current tasks and walked out of Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From a distance, he saw a stunning young girl in a Ferrari 720S waving at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you here? Don't you have to go to school?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina smiled, "Because I missed you. Not happy to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus, who had tanned, she felt a spark of attraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to have gained more masculine charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm very happy you're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus opened the door and got into the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't sit in the passenger seat. It is my first time in Solomia. You know the place better." Melina hurriedly said, getting out of the car and offering the driver's seat to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, she was wearing a short beige dress, her wheat-colored skin exposed, glowing softly in the sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her long hair fluttered in the breeze, highlighting her exquisitely sculpted features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't refuse and got into the driver's seat. Looking at Melina's stunning face, he asked jokingly, "Did you bring this car to make love in it again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina's face flushed instantly, and she glared at Marcus. "What are you thinking? Why do you always have such things on your mind? Can't I just miss you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm being very innocent, aren't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus put on a helpless expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... have nothing to do with innocence. You're a pervert!" Melina said disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wrapped his arm around her neck and pulled her in for a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their lips met, and Melina's delicate body trembled uncontrollably. She let out a soft gasp, her eyes widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you called me a pervert, I won't hold back anymore," Marcus said with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus' domineering kiss, Melina's cheeks turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus could faintly smell the light floral scent on her, which was intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked, "Shall we go straight to the hotel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina's heart raced more fiercely at Marcus' teasing, and she secretly started to look forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she still shook her head and glared at Marcus. "No. I just arrived in Solomia. You should show me around first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, of course, wouldn't refuse and drove off in Melina's Ferrari 720S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took Melina to a restaurant with local characteristics in Solomia for lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the afternoon, they went shopping at Vertex Plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina was very well-behaved throughout. The innocence and liveliness of a girl her age made Marcus' impression of her even better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was already half past five in the afternoon when they got back in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina said to Marcus, "Actually, there's a more important reason for my visit to Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is it?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's a bidding event tonight at the Solomia Imperial Hotel for the Bayside Amusement Park contractor project. I will represent the Flourish Group to attend. Will you accompany me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina looked at Marcus, her eyes filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was naturally aware of the Bayside Amusement Park project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The project hadn't started but had been hyped for half a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Major media in Solomia were promoting it, and even roadside billboards were ubiquitous with its advertisements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was touted as the largest amusement center in Airsia, rivaling the biggest amusement park in Acoton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The total investment reached two hundred billion Uswadian coins, and it was listed as one of the top ten projects in Solomia for the year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to the long propaganda period, Marcus had thought it would be another abandoned project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, the bidding process had been started quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go with me, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Marcus didn't speak for a while, Melina shook his arm, her eyes full of expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps without realizing it, she had started to depend on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At seven tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hooray, Marcus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Melina kissed Marcus on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus pushed Melina down, his broad hand reaching her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Melina was wearing something thin, even through the clothes, he could still feel her full and round breasts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
