  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't waste any more words with Jonathan. Instead, he made a call. "Inform the Solomia Construction to fire Jonathan and Paul immediately. If they refuse, terminate all business cooperation with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan and Paul exchanged glances before breaking into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are?" Paul sneered. "Threatening a construction company with canceled contracts? You're really playing boss now, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica sauntered over, wrapping herself around Paul's arm with a smug expression. "Honey, don't waste your energy on Marcus. He's always been a delusional dreamer! Not worth getting worked up over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hatred consumed Jonathan's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had nothing left to lose except his miserable life, and he was ready to drag Marcus down with him, even if it killed them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene terrified Melinda's family, who worried Marcus might get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda desperately pleaded with Louise. "Louise, please help! Talk to Mr. Whitby on Marcus's behalf. No matter how bad things are between us, it shouldn't come to this. If you don't step in now, Marcus is finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise shot Melinda an icy glare. "That good-for-nothing brought this on himself. I won't lift a finger to help. In fact, I hope Mr. Whitby teaches him a lesson he won't forget."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Louise's mind, Marcus was the one who had cost their family everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to take on Marcus themselves, they were thrilled that Jonathan would do their dirty work and satisfy their thirst for revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica wore a cold smirk, eagerly waiting for the moment Marcus would be beaten to a pulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, please say something! If you let these thugs loose, this will get out of hand. Marcus is still your grandson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Louise remained unmoved, Melinda turned to Samuel, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel shoved her away, his voice ice-cold. "I don't have such an ungrateful snake for a grandson. Getting roughed up is the least he deserves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, in Samuel's eyes, Louise's family were the real victims here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had to pay the price for his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda suddenly felt isolated from everyone, desperation flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret consumed her, and she shouldn't have let Marcus drive them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for her decision, Marcus wouldn't be in this dangerous situation now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination written across her face, Melinda grabbed Marcus's hand. "Marcus, these people are ruthless! Run! Your dad and I will hold them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried pushing Marcus toward the courtyard exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus gave his mother a reassuring look and smiled. "Mom, don't worry. These guys can't touch me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes swept over the weapon-wielding thugs as he asked, "You work for Jalen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Zafer? Who do you think you are to throw his name around like that?" the blonde-haired thug, Billy Marrow, sneered. "Boys, waste this guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, a gang of weapon-wielding thugs swarmed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They attacked with deadly intent, each strike aimed to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise's family watched with malicious glee, savoring every moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, this worthless freeloader who dared to mess with Paul was getting what he deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things didn't quite play out the way they expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing dozens of attackers, Marcus remained utterly unfazed, casually deflecting their attacks with minimal effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air filled with agonized screams as the thugs crumpled under Marcus's counterattacks, utterly outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, Marcus had single-handedly laid waste to the entire gang, leaving them groaning in pain on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan and Paul stood there slack-jawed, never imagining Marcus could be this formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Billy, realizing he'd picked a fight with the wrong person, started backing away while snarling, "You've got some massive balls messing with the Serpent's Coil! I'm calling Mr. Zafer right now! Let's see how tough you are when the boss shows up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise's family perked up at this, throwing mocking smiles at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had no clue who "Mr. Zafer" was, they were sure he must be someone compelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By beating up these thugs, Marcus had just made enemies with the criminal underworld of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, this was going to get interesting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was definitely going to get what was coming to him!</span></p><div class="pagination">
