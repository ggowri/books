  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson's brow furrowed as his eyes narrowed on Marcus. His voice was cold and hard, "Didn't think anyone in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> would have the guts to act like this. Guess it's time to teach this guy a lesson."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Orson's gaze locked onto Marcus. But when he saw Marcus' face clearly, his expression froze, disbelief taking over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"M-Mr. Fitzgerald... is it really you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson's voice wavered, his forehead breaking into a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair, Maximilian, and Fiona didn't notice the shift in Orson's demeanor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair, eager to get the ball rolling, stepped forward and said, "Mr. Hayes, this guy's way out of line. He's claiming the Serpent's Coil is under his control&mdash;he's making us look bad. You need to handle this, show some strength. If we let this slide, it'll ruin our rep. Don't you think, Mr. Hayes?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair smiled, trying to win Orson over with his words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as he finished, Orson's slap came like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The force sent Alistair stumbling back, almost falling to the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone around them was in stunned silence, eyes wide in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one could understand why Orson had struck Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair, holding his face, was confused. "Mr. Hayes, what the hell? Did you hit the wrong guy? He's the one who insulted the Serpent's Coil. You should be going after him, not me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian raised an eyebrow, equally unsure of what was happening.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Again, Orson slapped him&mdash;this time even harder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second slap sent Alistair to the ground, his face twisting in pain as he cried out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hayes! What's going on? What did I do wrong? Just tell me, please stop hitting me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's voice was full of hurt and confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was the owner of a high-end nightclub, and his net worth was in the tens of millions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being slapped in front of everyone was humiliating beyond measure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare insult Mr. Fitzgerald? Who else should I hit, huh? Let me make one thing clear&mdash;those words you said about him? I could rip you to pieces right now and still not feel satisfied."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson's voice was venomous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body was trembling with rage when he said those words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew exactly how powerful Marcus was. Even the big shots from the Serpent's Coil, like Jalen, bowed down to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And here was Alistair, throwing insults at him? It was practically asking for death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words hit Alistair, Maximilian, and Fiona like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't believe what they were hearing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was this really the same guy they had just dismissed as a nobody?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could someone with such a high status have slipped under their radar?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hayes, are you sure you've got the right guy? If he's really this important, why have I never heard of him before?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair asked, still unable to wrap his mind around the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Alistair could even finish speaking, Orson kicked him hard in the shoulder, sending him sprawling to the floor once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair screamed, his face contorted in pain, his mind spinning in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You still talking? Let me shut you up for good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson was beyond furious, completely losing his temper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stepped forward and began to pummel Alistair with punches and kicks, showing no mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair howled, his eyes full of shock and defiance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone, take him! Shut that mouth of his for good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson barked orders at his men, his rage still simmering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men immediately followed orders and stepped forward, delivering a brutal barrage to Alistair's mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was left battered, blood pouring from his nose and mouth, his face a mess, his teeth shattered beyond recognition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a gruesome sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Orson, under the stunned gaze of the crowd, approached Marcus. With a deep bow, he respectfully addressed him, "Mr. Fitzgerald, it's an honor to meet you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Serpent's Coil had more than ten thousand members, but Marcus had never come across Orson before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had a strict rule for his people: anyone taking a job had to research their target </span><span>thoroughly first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason was simple&mdash;he'd run into too many of his own men over the years. While their encounters didn't usually cause trouble, the frequency had started to wear on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's why he implemented this rule&mdash;to avoid unnecessary run-ins with his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Orson wasn't here for a task.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was just doing his part to collect protection fees from local businesses in his area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't take his frustrations out on him. Instead, he gestured for him to rise. "You can stand up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson hesitated for a moment, still looking nervous but obeyed, standing straight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was still a trace of fear in his eyes, as if he was worried Marcus might get upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I didn't know this guy was after you. If I had, I wouldn't have come here, even if you gave me a hundred lifetimes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson explained, still bowing low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively, signaling Orson to stop talking about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson visibly relaxed and cautiously asked, "Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, you're free to go," Marcus said, dismissing him with another wave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson nodded, still respectful, and turned back to look at Alistair, now in pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You better straighten up, especially around Mr. Fitzgerald. If I catch you disrespecting him again, next time, I'll break more than just your mouth&mdash;your skull's next!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Orson and his crew left, striding off with a mix of cold efficiency.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was left frozen, taking in the brutality of what had just happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't believe what they'd just witnessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all of it had been done for Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it be true, like Kiera had suggested earlier? Was the Serpent's Coil really under Marcus' control?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But quickly, the crowd dismissed the thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Serpent's Coil was enormous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the most powerful underground force in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>&mdash;how could it possibly be controlled by a man in his early twenties?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only reason Orson showed Marcus such respect, they reasoned, was that he must have ties to a high-ranking figure in the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this thought in mind, the crowd started to feel a bit more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason Marcus was so calm in front of the Serpent's Coil was his confidence&mdash;he knew they wouldn't dare touch him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, speculation about Marcus' true identity started swirling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who exactly did he know in the Serpent's Coil?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could he be connected to Jalen, the up-and-coming powerhouse of </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> underground scene?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that was the case, it would make sense!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's important to note that, at this point, the Serpent's Coil no longer had a true number one figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire organization was now being led by the former head of the Seven Stars Association.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if you were to name the most powerful person in the Serpent's Coil right now, it could only be Jalen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the head of the Seven Stars Association couldn't match Jalen's raw power now.</span></p><div class="pagination">
