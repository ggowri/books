  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Downstairs, Stanley was beaten until his face was covered in blood. Beside him stood a man with a muscular build.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was the very Toby he had spoken of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby Scott had worked for the Shadow Syndicate for over a decade, commanded hundreds of subordinates and was known for his ruthless character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that his subordinate Stanley was attacked, he naturally couldn't tolerate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It just so happened that he was collecting protection money from a nearby nightclub, so he immediately dropped what he was doing and rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't think you would actually stick around. Since that's the case, I'll show you what happens when you cross me!" Stanley sneered as he saw Marcus appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he turned to Toby and said, "Toby, he just hit me and refused to pay me back. You have to do something about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby looked over at Marcus and said, "Stanley is my subordinate. Don't you know what kind of punishment comes with hitting someone from the Shadow Syndicate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Pay ten times the amount you owe Stanley as punishment, and bring that girl over to keep me company for a few nights, and we'll call it even. Otherwise, I'll make you pay right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "I had no intention of getting involved in the gang conflicts of Solomia's underworld, allowing you all to compete fairly, but I didn't expect that you would come looking for trouble. In that case, from today on, the Shadow Syndicate will cease to exist. Anyone who opposes this will be dealt with without mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Bob, Stanley, Thomas, and even Catherine and her family were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked at Marcus with strange expressions, unsure of what he was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his words, it seemed like Stanley and others had offended him, and he intended to wipe out the entire Shadow Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who does he think he is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement was rather arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help doubting whether there was something wrong with his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley laughed outright, sarcastically addressing Marcus, "Kid, I'll admit you're not bad, but with your strength, even Toby could easily beat you, let alone the entire Shadow Syndicate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas couldn't help but laugh, saying, "Marcus, what are you thinking? Stop talking nonsense. If you offend Toby and the others completely, we'll be implicated too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas didn't want to die, so he strongly opposed the offensive words Marcus just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby waved his hand at Stanley and said, "This kid is quite interesting. It seems if I don't make him face reality, he'll keep living in a dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Toby gestured to his subordinates and said, "You guys, go ahead and teach this arrogant bastard a lesson. Make sure to disfigure him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His henchmen, armed with weapons, charged straight towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was terrified and quickly found a safe place to hide, afraid of being implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine was extremely worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus was the chairman of Golden Group with a net worth of billions, in front of these desperados, money was useless. He could lose his life if he was not careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, facing the assault of over a dozen of Toby's henchmen, Marcus remained completely calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed invincible. With every punch he threw, someone would scream and fall to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few moments, all of Toby's henchmen were on the ground, groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby was taken aback; Marcus's strength had surpassed his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him glance at Marcus with a deeper look. He said somewhat surprised, "Your strength has taken me by surprise. You really can fight, no wonder Stanley and the others weren't a match for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have always admired a strong man. As long as you work for me, not only do I not blame you, I'm willing to promote you. What do you say?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby still didn't seem to realize the seriousness of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still maintained an air of superiority, trying to recruit Marcus as one of his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "Even Tory from Serpent's Coil doesn't have the right to say that. Do you really think a lackey of the Shadow Syndicate deserves to be my boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Toby immediately became enraged and snarled at Marcus, "You're really spouting nonsense. Although Tory is an enemy of the Shadow Syndicate, he's still a respected elder in the underground world. It looks like you're hell-bent on finding your own death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Toby drew a machete and charged straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had practiced Ancient Martial Art, making him far more powerful than ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His knife skills were well-known throughout the underground world of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of thugs couldn't even get close to him when he held a machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one gang battle, Toby, with just a machete, single-handedly slew over a hundred armed enemies, earning him a fearsome reputation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his view, with a steel blade in hand, even if Marcus had some skills, he could only be chopped into mincemeat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Toby's muscles bulged, and he swung his machete horizontally towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade sliced through the air, tracing a cold arc, with an attack angle that was both cunning and impossibly fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas had a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was so arrogant, daring to offend even Toby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that even if he died by Toby's blade, he could blame no one but himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley also sneered, eagerly awaiting Marcus's demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Toby could deliver the fatal blow, Marcus's hand, like a wraith, directly seized Toby's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby was taken aback, trying to break free, but he felt as though Marcus's hand wasn't a hand at all, but a giant iron clamp!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't give Toby a chance to counterattack; instead, he kicked him in the abdomen.</span></p><div class="pagination">
