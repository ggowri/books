  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early investigations pointed to the attackers being part of a mercenary group known as the "Leviathan Legion".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group's headquarters was based in </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, but its members hailed from all corners of the globe, representing a mix of nationalities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious, though, that Leviathan Legion was just the muscle-for-hire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real puppet master behind the assassination plot was still in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Assassinations of national leaders weren't uncommon internationally, but in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, a country known for its robust security, it was almost unheard of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why, when Marcus first warned Julian and his team about the danger, they'd found his claims hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, wasn't planning to go after Leviathan Legion&mdash;not unless they made the mistake of coming after him first. For now, they weren't worth his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next few days, Marcus stayed put at Bayside Villa, savoring a rare moment of peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the day, he indulged in life's little pleasures&mdash;good food, fine wine&mdash;and at night, he immersed himself in his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His progress was steady, and his routine was surprisingly enjoyable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the third day, a knock echoed at the gates of Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl opened the door and was greeted by a group of uniformed military personnel. Leading them was a man in his early forties, his authoritative presence matched by the two stars and four bars on his shoulder&mdash;the insignia of a Colonel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood a young woman in her early twenties, a Lieutenant, with one bar and two stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl's brow furrowed, a mix of wariness and curiosity flickering across her face. "Can I help you? Who are you looking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately recognized them as military officers, but she couldn't recall ever crossing paths with the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military. Why were they here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to speak with Mr. Marcus Fitzgerald," the Colonel said, his tone firm but polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... Someone's looking for you!" Pearl called into the villa, her voice carrying a hint of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the years spent in the volatile rainforests of the Southwest</span><span> </span><span>that made</span><span> Pearl had developed a natural apprehension around men in uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, lounging by the pool in a white bathrobe and smoking lazily, raised an eyebrow at the commotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stubbed out his cigarette, stretched, and made his way to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's looking for me?" he asked, eyeing the uniformed group with mild surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Colonel stepped forward. "Are you Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's me. What's this about?" Marcus asked, his tone calm but curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the military personnel straightened to attention and snapped off a crisp salute. In unison, they declared, "It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus blinked, caught off guard. "Uh... I don't hold a rank, I'm not in office, and I definitely don't have any fancy title. You don't need to be this formal&mdash;it's honestly a bit weird."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't used to this kind of deference, especially from someone like the Colonel, who clearly held a significant position in the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Colonel, however, maintained his composure and stepped closer, carefully handing Marcus a certificate and a medal. "Mr. Fitzgerald, we're here on behalf of the central government to express our deepest gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In recognition of your actions three days ago on Sixth Avenue, where you protected the national commander, the central government has awarded you the title of 'Guardian of the Nation' and the honor of being named a First-Class Combat Hero. Please accept this certificate and medal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow as he accepted the items, his expression a mix of amusement and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titles like "Guardian of the Nation" and "First-Class Combat Hero" were nothing more than labels to him&mdash;empty accolades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since the recognition had been formally given, he wasn't going to turn it down.</span></p><div class="pagination">
