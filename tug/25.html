  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overweight man was none other than Jackson, the manager Amy had mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With years of experience under his belt and a solid track record, he had even acquired some shares in the Golden Group's real estate division.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gave Jackson considerable clout in the company, and he wielded it like a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's face was streaked with tears as she pleaded, "Mr. Hess, I haven't broken any company rules. Please don't fire me! My mother needs money for her treatment..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation overwhelmed her dignity as she begged Jackson, her voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little bitch! You brought this on yourself by trying to steal my client!" Amy chimed in, hands on her hips, her face twisted with malice and glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I run this sales office. I decide who stays and who goes. Don't lecture me about company policy!" Jackson growled, shoving Catherine aside with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Security! Get this little bitch out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several security guards quickly surrounded Catherine, ready to force her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't bear to watch any longer, stepping in front of Catherine protectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson, still looking down his nose at Marcus, replied, "You're the client my wife mentioned, right? Let me be clear: Cedars Villas is backed by the Golden Group. We don't have to worry about selling our properties; we don't need your business. This is an internal matter, so stay out of it unless you want to regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jackson spoke, it was evident he felt untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Golden Group, a diversified company, had products flying off the shelves, especially in real estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedars Villas, with its prime location, was already in its sixth phase of development, with the first five phases long sold out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Jackson felt confident enough to act so arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned, his voice cold. "As the manager here, treating a client like this damages the Golden Group's reputation. You're not fit for this position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson paused for a moment, then burst into laughter. "Listen, buddy, while you might have some cash, you have no say in Golden Group's affairs. My position is appointed from above. You don't really think you have the power to decide my fate, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy chimed in with a mocking laugh, "Honey, this guy seems to think he's some kind of executive at Golden Group, daring to challenge you. What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson had shares in the company, and even a regular executive wouldn't dare to touch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, remained unfazed. "You're unworthy of my attention. But if you stay here, you'll only tarnish the Golden Group's name. So today, I have to deal with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson couldn't help but laugh again, but then his expression turned menacing as he grabbed Marcus by the collar. "You think you can take me down? I'll make sure you never set foot in this office again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the situation escalate, Melinda rushed to defend her son, "Mr. Hess, my son doesn't know better. Please don't hurt him; if anyone should take the hit, it's me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beg me now? Too late!" Jackson sneered, raising his hand as if to strike Melinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus quickly caught Jackson's wrist, his voice low and dangerous. "You dare insult my mother? You must be looking to get yourself killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jackson could react, Marcus kicked him hard in the leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sickening crack as Jackson's leg snapped, bone protruding gruesomely through his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You actually laid hands on me? I'll make sure you pay for this!" Jackson howled, his face pale with pain as he glared at the security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get this guy out of here! I'll take responsibility for the consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards, seeing their boss get taken down, abandoned their posts and rushed at Marcus, ready to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were no match for Marcus. In just a few breaths, he had them all on the ground, howling in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, unable to believe how effortlessly Marcus had taken down Jackson and his security team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's face was a sickly shade of pale, his teeth clenched in fury. "You've really messed up by causing a ruckus here at Cedars Villas and harming my staff. You better be ready because you've crossed the Golden Group! You can wait right here while I call for backup to deal with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's heart sank; she never thought it would come to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret washed over her as she realized that if she had known things would escalate like this, she would have refused the commission and kept Marcus out of harm's way. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you need to leave now. Jackson's going to summon Golden Group's people. If you don't, you'll end up in deep trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Marcus, just go for now. We'll handle this!" Melinda urged, her voice laced with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard and Nicole nodded in agreement, eager to protect Marcus from any fallout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, he can't hurt me!" Marcus replied confidently, a determined glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly helped Richard's family into a sleek Alpha business van before returning to the sales office, where he casually sank into a chair, waiting without a care in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jackson had already dialed the number for Xavier Ulysses, the general manager of the Golden Group's real estate company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing about the trouble brewing in their sales office instantly ignited Xavier's temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned a small army of muscle-bound goons armed with all sorts of equipment, rushing them toward Cedars Villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your days are numbered, Marcus! You've messed with my husband, and Mr. Ulysses has already sent people over. We'll see how you fare then!" Amy glared at him, fury etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, his interest piqued. "Did he call Xavier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her arms crossed and a smug expression, Amy replied, "That's right, Mr. Ulysses is coming. You've heard of him, haven't you? It looks like you're not as clueless as you seem. If you're scared, just apologize to my husband and offer up an arm as penance. That's the only way to save your skin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he listened to Amy's bluster, a sarcastic smile spread across Marcus' face. "I thought you'd be summoning someone important. But it's just a real estate manager. What a joke. This is hardly a challenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson growled, his impatience boiling over, "Stop wasting time with him, sweetheart! Once Mr. Ulysses arrives, this punk is going to regret ever stepping foot in here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just five minutes later, a convoy of sleek black SUVs roared into the parking lot and screeched to a halt outside Cedars Villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier led a group of tough-looking men into the sales office, their presence commanding attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the sight of his reinforcements, Jackson's mood brightened instantly. "Mr. Ulysses, you finally made it!" he exclaimed, relief spilling into his voice.</span></p><div class="pagination">
