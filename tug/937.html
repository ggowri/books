  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially the wave of intense pleasure when the climax hit&mdash;it lingered in her memory, a feeling she couldn't quite shake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, on the outside, she maintained a mask of pure fury, determined never to let Marcus see the true effect he had on her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Want to kill me? You should be thanking me instead!" Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison </span><span>frowned,</span><span> her voice laced with anger. "You take my innocence and expect me to thank you? You're shameless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus briefly scanned her with a look before responding. "I don't want to waste time arguing. Check your cultivation for yourself." He said it with a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's striking blue eyes </span><span>narrowed,</span><span> her focus sharp. She quickly activated her internal sight, probing her cultivation state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she checked, her eyes widened in shock, and a look of pure joy spread across her face. "I broke through to the eighth level of Demon Fighter? What's going on? How did this happen? Why is this happening?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was hard to believe. Until recently, Alison had been stuck in a bottleneck. Her cultivation had stagnated at that level for over a decade, with no progress whatsoever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet now, she had miraculously broken through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, Alison even forgot the violation she had just endured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because we did Dual Cultivation. I helped you break through," Marcus explained calmly. "Do you get it now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's gaze momentarily sharpened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she remembered something. About a month ago, when she met Diana, she was shocked to discover that Diana's cultivation had already reached Level Nine of Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, Alison had been stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She distinctly remembered that Diana's cultivation had once been on par with hers, if not slightly lower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when they met again, Diana was ahead of her by two full levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison had been puzzled for a long time, feeling a blow to her confidence, even believing that she was inferior to Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, reflecting on her sudden cultivation breakthrough, Alison seemed finally to piece it all together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes widened with disbelief as she turned to Marcus. "Are you saying Diana's breakthrough in cultivation had something to do with Dual Cultivation with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded casually. "You could say that. But Diana's natural talent is stronger than yours, so after Dual Cultivation, she managed to break through two levels, while you only managed one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Marcus' explanation, a look of surprise crossed Alison's stunningly beautiful face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her understanding, the Dual Cultivation power was usually a method where a man would absorb a woman's feminine energy during their intimate union to enhance his cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the feminine energy was absorbed, the woman would either be rendered completely useless or, at the very least, weakened&mdash;if she didn't die from it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus' version of Dual Cultivation seemed different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sharing their cultivation, not only had he not absorbed her feminine energy, but he had nourished her, helping her break through the years-long bottleneck in her cultivation and advance to the eighth level of Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was almost beyond belief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, despite the astonishing results, a coldness still gripped Alison's heart when she thought back to the moment Marcus had forcibly pinned her down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always been fiercely protective of her purity, considering herself the woman of Roger. Even though Roger had no interest in women, Alison had silently vowed to keep herself pure for him, no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, after over a hundred years of guarding her chastity, this man in front of her had taken it all away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Alison's heart was filled with hatred for Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps it was the surge of power from her cultivation breakthrough, but Alison, in a burst of fury, once again gathered all her magic power, preparing to unleash a fatal strike at Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, his lips curling into a smirk full of contempt. Without a </span><span>second thought, he reached out with one powerful hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Alison's attack was ferocious, it was utterly useless against Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In one swift motion, he seized her wrist, his aura radiating with such force that it instantly suppressed all of Alison's magic power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frustration and disbelief flashed across Alison's face as she gritted her teeth, demanding, "Why? Why, after breaking through to the eighth level of Demon Fighter, can I still do nothing against you? What is this? Why can't I defeat you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly, his voice dripping with disdain, "Remember this, Alison. That first suppression you attempted in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> was also your last. From now on, all you'll know when you're in front of me is suppression. You'll never rise again in this lifetime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Marcus turned and walked away, not sparing her another glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alison watched </span><span>Marcus walk</span><span> away, a complex expression flickered across her striking blue eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she felt a terrifying aura radiating from him&mdash;an indescribable pressure that ordinary people could never hope to comprehend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm... this guy has reached Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm. This is unbelievable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Alison finally grasped the true extent of Marcus' cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shock that filled her was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her astonishment wasn't just from his rapid progress, but from the sheer power he possessed to challenge opponents far beyond his level. His ability to surpass such limitations left her in awe.</span></p><div class="pagination">
