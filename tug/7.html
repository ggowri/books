It's this gentleman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel manager </span><span>soon </span><span>pushed through the crowd, waving off security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed to Marcus. "Honorable Supreme Card holder, you are one of our group's most distinguished guests. Please forgive my oversight and the staff's rudeness. This way, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he respectfully motioned for Marcus to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail and Felix stood frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is that really the</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">so-called</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Supreme Card</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Isn</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">t </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Marcus just a </span><span style="font-style: italic;">useless </span><span style="font-style: italic;">loser</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Where the hell did he get that</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> valuable card</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus walked past them without a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That worthless nobody has a Supreme Card?" Abigail stomped her foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must've stolen it!" Felix snarled, refusing to accept the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail nodded eagerly</span><span> in agreement</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a fleet of cars pulled up. A Rolls-Royce Phantom stopped right in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man in a sleek suit stepped out of the car, exuding a powerful presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anthony Wesley, one of the two leading figures of Golden Group's major factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Golden Group's heavyweight, controlling 25% of shares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, why aren't you inside? The conference is starting," Anthony's eyes glinted beneath his silver temples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been planning to make Felix </span><span>the next </span><span>general manager, </span><span>solidifying</span><span> his control over the company's affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got held up by some trouble," Felix said, his mood brightening at Anthony's appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he felt he could reclaim some pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly explained about the Supreme Card incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished, </span><span>Anthony's eyebrows lifted a bit. "Those haven't been issued in years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person beside him </span><span>approached</span><span> and whispered, "Sir, only you and Mr. Davis can authorize those. Could it be the new chairman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's gaze sharpened, a calculating look flashing across his eyes. "Issuing cards before taking office? Bold. Now I'm even more curious to meet this new chairman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail leaned close to Felix. "Mr. Yannis, if the new chairman</span><span> is </span><span>your old friend, why didn't he give you a Supreme Card too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix froze, struggling to come up with an explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Must be because I'm with Mr. Wesley," he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail nodded, though suspicion nagged at her. She was already plotting how to build ties with both the chairman and Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Golden Hotel's banquet hall, Solomia's elite had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a sharp suit, Marcus walked in, drawing all attention the moment he </span><span>enter</span><span>ed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some didn't bother hiding their sneers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look who it is - the Winchesters' lap dog. Three years married and his wife wouldn't even let him touch her. He even donated a kidney to save her! </span><span>A good-for-nothing. </span><span>How dare he show up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Winchester family was a third-rate family in Solomia, everyone knew about their worthless son-in-law, Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one wanted anything to do with him, leaving a wide berth around his table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't mind, sir, you're welcome to join me," a soft voice offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman in an elegant cream gown smiled warmly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing genuine kindness in her eyes, Marcus accepted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She introduced herself as Michelle Smith, daughter of Golden Group's former president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had graduated from Briarwood University with a degree in economics and management.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father, Frank, had passed away in the power plays within the company due to conflicts of interest with the other two factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a candidate for this selection, she was fighting to reclaim her father's legacy today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their conversation flowed naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle was graceful, well-spoken, and refreshingly unprejudiced about his past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had a </span><span>very </span><span>good impression of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, Marcus, you're really something. I just dumped you </span><span>not long </span><span>ago and you're already </span><span>hooking up with others</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail's voice cut through the air as she strutted in with Felix and Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abigail</span><span>, y</span><span>ou better watch your mouth, or I'll make you regret it," Marcus warned, his cold stare making her stumble back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon Mr. Yannis will be the general manager of Golden Group. I'd like to see what you can possibly do!"</span><span> </span><span>Abigail</span><span> snorted disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anthony's support behind Felix, everyone assumed the general manager position was set for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll never get that position," Marcus declared firmly. "Not while I'm here."</span></p><div class="pagination">
