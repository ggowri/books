  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words froze everyone in their tracks, Darian, Ramona, Aniya, and even the nurse, Sophia, were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona's voice trembled as she asked, "Cal is okay? Really? Darian, let's go see him, quick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian snapped out of his shock and hurried to follow Ramona into the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia and Aniya trailed behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, Cal was awake, his face flushed with color, looking lively and alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera was feeding him fruit, and Cal was eating with gusto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he saw Darian and Ramona enter, he smiled widely and shouted, "Mom, Dad, you're here! I don't want to stay here anymore. I feel like I'm completely better now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, Ramona, Aniya, and Sophia gathered around the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Cal, completely stunned. His face was no longer pale or sickly&mdash;it was full of life. For a moment, none of them knew how to react, but then their faces lit up with pure joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's really better! This is unbelievable!" Ramona's voice quivered with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, Ramona hadn't had any hope left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Darian had insisted on letting Marcus into the ICU, Ramona had been dismissive and even contemptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, her mind had been focused on leaving Darian, and she hadn't stopped him from bringing Marcus in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never could have imagined that Marcus had such extraordinary medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cal's congenital heart disease had been severe, and even the top specialists from Kingston had given up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona was at a loss for how Marcus had cured her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian rubbed his eyes in disbelief, even questioning whether this was some kind of dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For years, he had drained his savings, worked himself to the bone, and still found himself buried in debt, all in an attempt to save his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no idea when the hardship would end, but as a father, he had gritted his teeth and kept going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Never had he imagined that a chance car accident would lead to a miracle that saved his son's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did this kid really cure him?" Aniya's voice was full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia, the nurse, had only recently joined the hospital and was unaware of Marcus' reputation at Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She, too, was skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She rushed out to call for the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Crawford, who had been on duty, seemed unbothered by the commotion. With a calm expression, he said, "What's the fuss about? I've already told you&mdash;if Mr. Fitzgerald is involved, Cal's condition is as good as cured. There's no need for any more tests. If the family agrees, they can take him home tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had worked as a nurse for several years, encountering many renowned doctors, but never had she seen one who could heal a congenital heart condition without surgery or medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not fully believing Dr. Crawford's words, she rushed back to the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She brought in the heart monitoring equipment and conducted her own test on Cal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The results left her stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cal, once plagued by a severe congenital heart condition, now had a heart that was healthier than most people's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the shape of his heart and the surrounding blood vessels, it was clear that, barring any accidents, he would never suffer from heart disease again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was nothing short of a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia's gaze toward Marcus shifted. Filled with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you so much for saving my son's life. You're truly a lifesaver for our entire family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian rushed out of the room, dropping to his knees in front of Marcus. "Please, let me thank you properly." He tried to bow his head in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus quickly helped him up. "I told you I'd help your son. I always keep my word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona, too, expressed her heartfelt thanks to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Aniya walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But rather than looking pleased or surprised, she still wore a dark expression. "Even if Cal's better, it doesn't change the fact that you're just a laborer. So, your marriage is still over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian was jolted out of his moment of joy. He turned to Aniya, his voice urgent. "Aniya, I know I haven't made a lot of money over the years, but I've been working hard. Why can't you understand that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya sneered. "Understand you? Who's understanding me? I'd love a son-in-law who can take care of me. But you&mdash;look at you! You can't even support Ramona, let alone take care of me. Director Rollins' son is the one with the good job&mdash;earning a million-dollar salary. If Ramona had married him, I'd be living the good life, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aniya, I'll work harder. I'll do everything I can to make sure Ramona and you have a better life. Please, don't talk about divorce anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's plea was filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Cal was better, he couldn't bear the thought of losing Ramona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's eyes narrowed, her lips curling into a dismissive smile. "Work hard? What for? You really think this guy's going to make you a million-dollar salary?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
