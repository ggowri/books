  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cole family, I won't forget this!" Marcus said, his eyes sharp with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, he killed Jordon and his grandson because they repaid kindness with betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had treated their illness and accepted payment&mdash;a fair and voluntary exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Jordon and his grandson grew greedy, plotting to kill Marcus and take back the payment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People like that didn't deserve to live in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet the Cole family ignored all this. All they cared about was that one of their own had been killed by a Uswadian man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And they were determined to seek revenge for their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember it all you want. In the afterlife, you'll have no way to avenge yourself against the Cole family, so why not say something useful instead?" the silver-haired woman sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she raised her hand, summoning a fierce gust of wind around Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wind swirled violently, unleashing an immensely terrifying wind-elemental force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, glints of cold light flashed within the whirlwind, like a deadly grinder, aiming to tear Marcus to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wind metahuman abilities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus immediately understood that the silver-haired woman was a wind-element metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, her mastery of wind-elemental power was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An ordinary person would have no way to resist; they'd be shredded to pieces by the storm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus wasn't ordinary. Faced with the terrifying whirlwind, he threw a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His punch carried the power of Thunderfire Power, with Timeless Numinous Energy swirling around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, his attack collided with the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A deafening rumble erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just one punch, the whirlwind shattered into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight made the silver-haired woman's expression falter slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' punch was far beyond what anyone at Ancient Martial Stage Two could possibly achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could react, Marcus took a step forward, his figure splitting into countless afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he was in front of the silver-haired woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The silver-haired woman was horrified, and even the metahuman with heterochromatic eyes nearby was shocked by Marcus' speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man quickly unleashed a burst of flame, trying to push Marcus back and protect the silver-haired woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus had already reached Ancient Martial Stage Six, far surpassing the level of a fourth-tier metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, Marcus dissipated the fire attack entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he threw a punch at the silver-haired woman, whose face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly summoned another whirlwind to block him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of the impact roared through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whirlwind was utterly destroyed by Marcus' punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' fist, unstoppable, landed directly on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The silver-haired woman let out a scream as her body was blasted backward like a cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slammed into a nearby boulder with such force that it cracked and shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body trembled as she coughed up blood, collapsing weakly onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With one punch, Marcus instantly defeated a fourth-tier metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in death, the silver-haired woman's eyes remained wide open, her expression frozen in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps, even at the end of her life, she couldn't comprehend the sheer strength Marcus possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&mdash;you're not at Ancient Martial Stage Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heterochromatic metahuman suddenly realized this, retreating while launching several flames in an attempt to threaten Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't even bother dodging. He stepped forward, completely ignoring the attacks, and swung another punch at the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The metahuman's face was filled with panic. Even before the fist connected, he could feel the terrifying destructive force emanating from it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" he shouted desperately, but it was useless. Marcus' unstoppable punch smashed directly onto his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A muffled bang echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The metahuman's head exploded on the spot, his unique eyes shattering with it. He was beyond dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining cyborgs were stunned. They instantly realized they were no match for Marcus and desperately tried to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't give them a chance. Without moving, bolts of lightning descended from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each lightning strike was as powerful as a fourth-tier Wizard, posing a deadly threat to the cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of crackling echoed endlessly as the lightning reduced the cyborgs to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their damaged internal mechanisms ignited quickly, engulfed in flames until they burned to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wasted no time. With a wave of his hand, flames erupted from his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fire enveloped the scattered remains on the ground, burning them to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing, he returned to his Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade was still curled up in the car, trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you okay?" Marcus asked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
