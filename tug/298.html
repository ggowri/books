  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They delayed for over an hour more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan didn't realize his old friend didn't have the right, and he was embarrassed, so he asked a male doctor in a white coat not far away, "Jeffrey, haven't I told you this before? Why do I have to stand in line everywhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeffrey Harvin smiled helplessly, "Just calm down. I've helped you get ahead of the line, and there are too many people seeing Mr. Grant. There's nothing I can do about it. I can treat your dad, and you don't have to wait in line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan cursed casually, "Go away. Don't I know what you're capable of? You have nothing to compare to Mr. Grant. Well, we shouldn't be in this hospital, and it's just too crowded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jeffrey shrugged without getting upset. He did seem to be getting on well with Allan as he said, "Allan, why don't you wait in line here while I see a patient? When you get there, I'll tell Mr. Grant that he'll treat your dad properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying that, Jeffrey greeted Nick, Aria and Lisa respectively, and hurried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria couldn't help but complain, "We even asked for help, but we had to wait in line for so long. Your dad can't hold out much longer. What are we going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa said, "Mom, you should be satisfied. If Allan hadn't asked for help, we might have had to wait in line longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a young male doctor passed by not far away and happened to see Marcus in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't remember much about the male doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The male doctor didn't seem to realize it, so he hurriedly introduced himself. "Mr. Fitzgerald, have you forgotten me? I'm Harry Evans, a doctor working for Mr. Miller."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Charles' employee, Harry witnessed Marcus' miraculous cure for terminal cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had long considered Marcus his idol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only because the news was so shocking that it was kept under wraps. Neither the doctors nor the government were allowed to spread the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Harry still remembered the impressive scene very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, I remember a bit about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, never mind. A great man like you is busy every day, so it's normal that you don't remember me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, Mr. Fitzgerald, why have you come to the hospital? Are you in line? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harry asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I came with my uncle to treat his cerebral infarction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harry was stunned. He was just about to say that Marcus would cure the cerebral infarction, but he swallowed it back before he could say anything. The hospital didn't allow HIM to reveal anything about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, why don't you tell Mr. Miller? And you don't have to wait in line," Harry continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My cousin's boyfriend got his friend, so I won't bother Mr. Miller," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, alright. Mr. Fitzgerald, you can stay in line, and I'm going to head to the medical department."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harry nodded and left as he glanced over at Allan and Lisa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, who is he? Does he know you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I know him well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan and Lisa looked at each other with some surprise in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could tell from Marcus' conversation with Harry that Harry seemed to be respectful of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Also, who was Charles that Harry was talking about? He seemed to mean that Charles could help them not have to wait in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could Marcus know such a big shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No, it was absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa denied her ideas like this directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you Marcus married into a rich family, so he definitely had connections, but you just didn't listen," Aria told Lisa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa smiled, "Mom, I just don't want to bother Marcus. Are you serious? With all the patients at Solomia Hospital, what kind of big shot does he have to know to not have to wait in line?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Allan is pretty close to his friend, but he still has no idea what to do. Do you think Marcus knows any doctors better than Allan's friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa's words made Aria speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was true. Some sophisticated people looked affable very often, no matter who they met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, they were only acting friendly. If they had asked him for a favor, he wouldn't agree to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought that Harry might be that kind of person just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Nick's state got even worse, and he suddenly fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth, lying on his back, and looking like he was about to pass away.</span></p><div class="pagination">
