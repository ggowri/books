  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In recent years, Builder Market's performance has been declining year by year due to the impact of online shopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to last year's financial report, Builder Market had been barely surviving, relying on subsidies from the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is your chairman's surname Dixon?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought to himself, "I vaguely saw this name on the Builder Market page of the financial report Michelle handed to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But I only remembered the surname, not the full name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, the chairman's name is Dylan Dixon. Do you know him, Marcus?" Allan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, Dylan won't be able to fire you." Marcus reassured Allan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan froze for a moment, exchanging a glance with Lisa, unsure of what Marcus meant by this statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus then took out his phone and made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other end of the line, Michelle's voice came through. "Mr. Fitzgerald, is there something you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus got straight to the point, "I'm at Solomia Hospital, in the cardiovascular department. Have Dylan Dixon from Builder Market come to see me. I'm giving him five minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Marcus hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan and Lisa could hardly believe his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, Marcus just told the chairman to come here within five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How is that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus is skilled in medicine and has a vast network, but how could he possibly know Dylan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan is a billionaire tycoon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And more importantly, Marcus just gave him a five-minute ultimatum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clearly an order from a superior to a subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Marcus really knew Dylan, how could Marcus command him like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa seemed unable to hold back anymore and asked Marcus, "Marcus, the Dylan you're talking about is the chairman of Builder Market, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I just called. Dylan should be here in five minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus replied as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, I could believe that you know the chairman, but telling him to come here in five minutes? Is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa still couldn't wrap her head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To them, Dylan was like a top-tier tycoon, a billionaire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could someone like Dylan just show up at Marcus' beck and call?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, I really hope the chairman does come, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan sighed, but his words trailed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was hard for him to believe Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't explain. Instead, he remained quiet and waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't that Dylan, the chairman of Builder Market? Why is he here at the hospital? Is he sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at how he's walking so briskly. Does that look like someone here for a check-up? I think he's here to see someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, he definitely doesn't look sick. He must have other business here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, voices were heard outside the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People automatically made way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bald man, about 5 feet 5 inches tall but weighing close to 200 pounds, walked quickly toward them, leading a group of sharply dressed bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bald man exuded a commanding presence, though not tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he arrived at the room where Marcus and the others were waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr... Mr. Dixon, you're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan was stunned when he saw Dylan, his expression full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa was also in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan completely ignored Allan, walking straight up to Marcus. After bowing, he said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you asked me to arrive within five minutes. It's 4 minutes and 30 seconds now. I'm not late. Please give me your instructions, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan just finished, and Allan and Lisa felt as though they had been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Marcus in complete disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never imagined that the phone call Marcus made earlier was actually real!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus told Dylan to come within five minutes, and Dylan did it in just 4 minutes and 30 seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It has shown just how vital Marcus' words were to Dylan," They thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus remained seated in his chair, looking at Dylan. "Did you approve of firing Allan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan Dixon froze for a moment, instinctively glancing at Allan not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mind quickly began to process Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was no stranger to the ways of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he understood Marcus' meaning and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, there must have been some misunderstanding. Aaron has been reporting Allan to me, and I believe his slander. That's why I agreed to fire him. It has nothing to do with me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
