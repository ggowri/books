Instead, they wore expressions of grim determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who from the Nuer Tribe will step forward to die first?" </span><span>Rusell</span><span> taunted, his body suspended in the seawater, arrogance radiating from him as he surveyed the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stepped up, wielding a heavy iron sword, and charged at </span><span>Rusell</span><span>, declaring, "You are so arrogant. Prepare to be destroyed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he swung, a wave of destructive energy surged, and the sword light cut through the water with exceptional sharpness, reaching </span><span>Rusell</span><span> in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rusell</span><span> smirked disdainfully and countered with a powerful fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Fist Ray surged forward, colliding with Elliott's sword light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott felt a violent tremor in his arm as an overwhelming force struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arm went numb, the sword flew from his grasp, and he was knocked back several feet before regaining his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rusell</span><span> sneered, "With this little strength, are you qualified to fight me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift step, he closed the distance to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As members of the Shark Tribe, they had inherited the characteristics of the underwater sharks. Not only were they extremely fast, but their attack power was also extremely fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this </span><span>deep sea</span><span> area, they could better play their advantages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just took a casual step, and in the blink of an eye, his body appeared in front of Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed another formidable Fist Ray, resembling a terrifying battle shark, intent on engulfing Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panicking, Elliott prepared to defend himself against the oncoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crack, Elliott was hurled into the air, blood spilling from his mouth as he crashed onto the underwater castle, shattering it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father!" grief washed over Susan's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined the vast disparity between her father and </span><span>Rusell</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Nuer Tribe has no fighters left.

"If you want the Nuer Tribe to submit, you'll have to get through me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Micah emerged from his camp, sneering, "Your opponent is me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rusell</span><span> retreated into his camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The showdown between the two tribes was imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And tension thickened in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Shark Tribe's invasion, there had never been a confrontation between the chiefs of the two tribes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, whoever wins or loses would determine the rise and fall of the tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael glanced at his tribe and waved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, a massive figure approached&mdash;the roc, a legendary cetacean from ancient </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nadia, Susan, if I lose, take Mr. Fitzgerald on this creature. It has great magical power and can break through the confinement array!" Raphael instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the Nuer Tribe's last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the face of defeat, Raphael needed to protect their future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadness and anger filled Nadia and Susan. They were ready to fight for their tribe but nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, none of you will escape today!" Micah declared coldly, launching an attack on Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two chiefs clashed fiercely in the giant square.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the strongest of the two tribes, this battle was naturally extremely fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone unleashed the strongest power they possessed without reservation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Raphael held his ground against Micah, but gradually, his inferiority became apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His realm was not as good as Micah's, and he was also cursed, which completely </span><span>affected his performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a collision, he was shocked and retreated continuously, with blood oozing from the corners of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment, Micah sneered, "It's time to end this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He charged forward, releasing a wave of destructive energy infused with the Shark Tribe's bloodthirsty aura, aiming to deliver a final blow to Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the attack engulfed Raphael, he desperately channeled his power to resist, but it was futile. The destructive force invaded him relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Stewart!" The Nuer Tribe watched in anguish, longing to retaliate against the Shark Tribe, but their strength was insufficient to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Raphael was about to die in battle, they were powerless to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" Micah's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as he intensified his attack to finish Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a stream of destructive light descended from above, accompanied by a deafening explosion that shattered Micah's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horrified, Micah staggered back, and the onlookers were stunned by the unexpected turn of events, all eyes drawn to the source of the light as a young figure emerged, stepping forward.</span></p><div class="pagination">
