  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the Cole family members were gripped by the fear of death, frantically trying to break down the doors to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't about to give them any chance. Wave after wave of terrifying attacks erupted, and in less than ten minutes, everyone trapped in the hall was slaughtered by him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus unleashed his Fire Attribute Power without hesitation, setting the hall ablaze. Then, with a flicker of teleportation, he returned to the Bayside Villa in Solomia of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journey was no small feat. Uswad was over six thousand miles from Acoton, and a single teleport consumed nearly half of Marcus' Numinous Energy. To play it safe, he didn't jump straight to the Cole family's location but teleported to a mountain range near their stronghold in Acoton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the rugged terrain, Marcus rested and recuperated, replenishing his energy to its peak. Only then did he execute a second teleport, arriving directly at the Cole family's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, Marcus had just come out of an intense battle. Even though no one posed a real threat to him, killing so many in one go had drained a significant amount of his Numinous Energy. And after completing his task, he immediately teleported back to Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' reserves were now dangerously low. Barely thirty percent of his Numinous Energy remained. Exhaustion clung to him, leaving him visibly weary, even fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasted no time. He sat cross-legged on his bed, quickly consuming several healing pills to aid his recovery. One full day and night passed in meditation before his energy was fully restored, bringing him back to fighting form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus had left the Cole family estate, the scene he left behind was nothing short of apocalyptic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raging flames erupted swiftly, engulfing the grand hall in a sea of fire. The blaze spread rapidly to other parts of the estate, leaving destruction in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cole family members fled in panic, desperate to summon the fire department. Yet, to their shock, the high-pressure water cannons not only failed to extinguish the inferno but seemed to fuel its intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than an hour, the once-magnificent estate of the Cole family, a symbol of power and prestige in Acoton, was reduced to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse still, all the family's senior members and the metahumans they employed were slaughtered without exception. Even their elite squad of fourth-generation cyborgs met the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The devastation sent shockwaves across Acoton. The deceased represented the very foundation of the Cole family. With their roots destroyed, the family's ability to protect itself crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rival factions, long harboring ambitions against the Cole family, seized the opportunity. Some carved up their business empire, others took over territories, and a few aggressively bought up shares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-dominant Cole family plummeted from its zenith to its nadir in mere hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though many family members were still alive, none could step up to restore its glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speculation about the culprit's identity ran rampant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some detective organizations that were eager for attention had launched in-depth investigations into the incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they knew was that the Cole family had recently been targeting a young man from Uswad named Marcus Fitzgerald. However, no one took Marcus seriously as a suspect. The reasons were straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Marcus was not believed to possess such overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, at the time of the incident, there was solid evidence proving that Marcus was over six thousand miles away in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marcus had the strength to annihilate the Cole family, he didn't have the time to commit the crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Marcus was the first to be ruled out. Beyond him, the detective organizations found no other leads. The identity of the perpetrator remained a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained oblivious to the chaos unfolding at the Cole family estate and didn't care. The only reason he had gone to Acoton, using teleportation no less, was to avenge those who had crossed him. The Cole family had sent experts to ambush him, nearly harming Jade in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had his own set of principles. If someone sought revenge against him, he could handle it. But endangering the people around him was crossing the line. Once that line was breached, no matter who or where the offender was, Marcus would go to any lengths to make them pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the ambush, Marcus' Aston Martin had taken some damage, with two windows completely shattered. Once his Numinous Energy was fully restored, he drove the car to a repair shop to fix it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the paperwork done, Marcus was about to call a ride back to Bayside Villa when his phone buzzed. Shannon's voice came through as soon as he picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I need your help with something! Please, this is urgent. You have to say yes!" Shannon pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, his tone calm yet curious. "What's got you so worked up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon sighed dramatically, "My uncle and aunt from Kingston are visiting Solomia. I didn't want to meet them, but my dad called and insisted I take care of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then just go," Marcus said with a chuckle. "They're family, after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't get it," Shannon groaned. "They're always trying to set me up with someone. I'm so sick of it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
