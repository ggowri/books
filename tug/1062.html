  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Alison's body succumbed to the relentless pleasure, her consciousness fading under the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gazed at her and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slut like her deserved to be taken hard, broken until she surrendered completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she'd keep pretending to be pure, raising a chastity arch while secretly yearning for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he lasted a full two hours before reaching his peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spreading her legs wide, he unleashed a final, frenzied barrage into her sodden entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed and ferocity drove her to at least three more climaxes, her body collapsing in exhaustion as he finally released his essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It mingled it with hers in a torrid fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished, Alison seemed on the verge of passing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she forced herself upright, her icy gaze locking onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lecher, one day I'll kill you and make you pay for everything you've done," she hissed through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed, "You slut, you were begging me to take you just moments ago. Now that I'm done, you flip the script? How cheap can you get?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His harsh words dragged her back to the memory of her surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been lost in that delirious bliss, craving nothing but him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no hatred to speak of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with clarity creeping in, hatred surged anew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mockery left her speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A part of her wondered if she truly was the wanton creature he described.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?" he snorted. "I'd rather you be honest about what you want instead of living behind a fake mask. Don't you get tired of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He read her like an open book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was prideful. Anything that shamed her, no matter how much she enjoyed it, she'd reject out of instinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a classic case of suffering for the sake of face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind your own business. How I live has nothing to do with you," Alison shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pinned her down again, their eyes locking. She flinched, her gaze wavering. His masculine scent overwhelmed her, quickening her pulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't pull away, that desire might consume her again, driving her to reckless acts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dual cultivating with me not only feels good, but it's also boosting your cultivation. Yet you deny your own heart, threatening to kill me the moment we're done. People like you have no conscience at all," Marcus sneered, rising from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his presence faded, a flicker of loss tugged at Alison's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She craved his embrace. It was a twisted, evil longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a rapist and her sworn enemy, yet she yearned for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off her thoughts, she switched on her Inner Vision. To her shock, Marcus was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through this Dual Cultivation, her cultivation had risen from Level Nine Demon Fighter to the minor completion stage of that state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was now a mere step from the peak of Level Nine Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she broke through, she could aim for Saint Magician state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement stirred within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a wizard like her, beyond fulfilling innate duties, advancing her cultivation was paramount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a century of practice, she'd only reached Level Seven Demon Fighter. Since meeting Marcus, she'd shattered two states, climbing to Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, violated again, her cultivation had grown further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside the wonder, a new thought bloomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could his assaults truly be the key to my breakthroughs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, this question had already been proven before. The first time she was with Marcus, he had helped her shatter a bottleneck that had stymied her for over a decade, elevating her cultivation to the level of a Level Eight Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, however, Alison had been so consumed by hatred that it dulled even the joy of her breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that all these gains come from doing that with you?" Alison asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "What else? That's why I said you're ungrateful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless!" Alison spat. "Even without you, I could've broken through some other way. Stop spewing such disgraceful nonsense. As long as I live, my goal is to kill you and avenge myself. Just wait. One day, I'll crush you underfoot and make you pay for what you've done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stubborn defiance sparked fury in Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged, pinning her back onto the bed. Aligning himself with her still-wet entrance, he thrust inside without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slick penetration was seamless, filling her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth to curse him, but the swelling fullness and searing pleasure silenced her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You slut, every time you turn ungrateful, I'll pound you senseless until you're thanking me," Marcus growled, watching her face twist into rapturous surrender once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hips slammed into her with ferocious intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, driven by rage, his thrusts were even more brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison teetered between ecstasy and oblivion, climaxing eight times before the storm subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ordeal left her almost unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sprawled across the bed, panting heavily. Her flushed skin glistened with sweat, her lower body a mess of white fluids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a picture of utter ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lay beside her, breathing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that as his cultivation and Dual Cultivation power grew, his refractory period had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could plunge into another round immediately without losing stamina or potency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a perk no other man could claim, one that served him well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to Alison's high cultivation, these two sessions had pushed his state forward, elevating him to the peak of Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now a hair's breadth from Stage Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such progress was freakishly fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled how, less than a year ago, Felix and Abigail had betrayed him. The pendant had merged with his body, granting him the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and setting him on the path of a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a mere mortal, he'd risen to an expert at the peak of the Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His progress was unrivaled in the Uswad's world of Ancient Martial Art, perhaps even within the Morvalis Ice Wall.</span></p><div class="pagination">
