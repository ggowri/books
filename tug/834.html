  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you must come to Kingston to see me often, or I will miss you," Natalia said affectionately, gazing at Marcus with tender eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she hadn't seen Marcus for over a month, and she truly missed him deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one point, she even had the urge to return to Solomia to find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I will come here often," Marcus reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently stroked Natalia's hair and asked, "By the way, your winter break is coming soon, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost December, and the weather in Kingston had already turned chilly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, and then I'll return to Solomia. That way, I can see you every day," Natalia replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of returning to Solomia made Natalia smile from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung tightly to Marcus, resembling an octopus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft mounds pressed firmly against Marcus' chest, allowing him to clearly feel their shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that as Natalia grew older, her chest was gradually becoming fuller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she developed fully, her breasts would undoubtedly be larger than those of any woman Marcus had ever met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she still had that youthful and pure face, which was a visual feast for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loved women who looked like that the most. At that moment, an image of Natalia as a grown woman involuntarily surfaced in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reacted again, firming up a little against Natalia's vagina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia froze, and her face blushed once again. She tried to move away from Marcus. "Marcus, you're so bad. I can feel you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Natalia could release her arms, Marcus had already pinned Natalia back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia looked at Marcus, who was close by, and her heart pounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the tension, her vagina was also getting a little wetter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, you're so pretty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but sigh and then involuntarily kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's body felt an electric shock. Just as she wanted to speak, her mouth was blocked by Marcus, and she could only let out a whimper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kiss mobilized Marcus' desire again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tongue quickly pried open Natalia's teeth and slipped into Natalia's mouth, savoring Natalia's taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's body softens, falling into an abyss of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the young girl with a blushed yet pure face and the most gorgeous curves, Marcus couldn't help himself. He aligned the penis and thrust it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they both got into it faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensations coming from them made Natalia let out another gush of high-pitched sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was pumping and thrusting while playing with Natalia's big breasts, which made Natalia more sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short while, Natalia came once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with an ambiguous atmosphere, banging, gasping, and shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took two hours for this sexual affair to be completely over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's body was limp and unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Natalia, who fell into a deep sleep, Marcus smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that his strength had once again grown with these two sexual events and had reached the tipping point between the Foundation Establishment Stage and the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly took a shower in the bathroom and then sat cross-legged on the bed, starting to use the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that it was the best opportunity for him to break through the Foundation Establishment Stage and advance to the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Threads of Timeless Numinous Energy constantly swirled around Marcus, circulating through the energy channels within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These energies could refine Marcus' muscles and bones, nourishing his body, and ultimately returning to his lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' organs seemed to awaken as every cell pulsating in rhythm with the circulation of the Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He entered a state of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a Return Essence Crystal from his Spatial Ring and held it in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Return Essence Crystal was the size of a fist, releasing powerful energy that transmitted from Marcus' palm into his body, bringing him an intense feeling of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, the Return Essence Crystal slowly floated up, stopping in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy it emitted became increasingly intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chanted a spell, unleashing the abilities of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to the fullest, causing the Timeless Numinous Energy to surge more vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus held the Return Essence Crystal in his palm, wrapping it in Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the method recorded in the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, he began to refine the Return Essence Crystal little by little and absorb it into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Return Essence Crystal integrated into Marcus' body, he could clearly feel that his body was undergoing a transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin, flesh, bones, organs, and cells were steadily diminishing, while new substances continuously grew in their original places to replace them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My body is actually being reshaped..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus never expected that breaking through to the Return Essence stage would involve a physical transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to general records, the process of reshaping the body was extremely painful, something ordinary people could not endure, often requiring near-death experiences to complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Marcus truly experienced this process, he found that reshaping the body was nothing like what was recorded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus could clearly sense the restructuring of tissues within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt no pain at all. Instead, he felt a sense of rebirth, as if a silkworm had transformed into a butterfly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Return Essence Crystal continued to merge into Marcus' body, his physical reshaping speeded up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and stomach were gradually restructured in sequence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The organs, after reshaping, became even more powerful, capable of withstanding stronger impacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin, flesh, and bones also underwent an unprecedented transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had gained an immortal body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on Marcus' estimation, after advancing to the Return Essence stage, his body could withstand the impacts from the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process of reshaping his body lasted for about three hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing it, Marcus was essentially a new person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bodily strength had reached an entirely new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, the aura emanating from Marcus underwent a transformation, no longer resembling the ordinary presence of someone in the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had truly reached a new level: the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that his cultivation had stepped into the first realm of the Return Essence stage, the Acquired State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was a warrior of the Acquired State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He belonged to the top powerhouses in the Ancient Martial Art World of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides him, it was estimated that only those reclusive old warriors possessed such a realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those individuals might have lived for hundreds of years, experiencing the vicissitudes of life as ageless beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus was just in his early twenties. Moreover, he had only been cultivating Ancient Martial Art for about six months, yet he climbed to the height of the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a cultivation speed was nothing short of a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not even realize that after his breakthrough, an extremely intense phenomenon had occurred in the sky above him, spanning dozens of miles around.</span></p><div class="pagination">
