  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence enveloped the space as everyone froze, staring in disbelief at Micah, whose trembling body lay among the rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that someone as powerful as Micah, having reached Stage Nine, could be defeated by a single punch from Marcus, destroying his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer strength displayed was terrifying and frightened the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, they had considered capturing Marcus to prevent him from curing Nadia of Cursed Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Raphael lost and Marcus stepped in, they doubted Marcus could match Micah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they realized their underestimation of Marcus' true power was foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His calm demeanor towards the Nuer and Shark Tribes made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never regarded them as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia and Susan looked at Marcus with admiration, surprised not only by his medical skills but also his formidable strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah coughed from the ruins, staring at Marcus in disbelief. "How is it possible for you to be so strong? What are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe that the Nuer tribe had a relationship with such a powerful human ancient warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "Dealing with someone like you is easy. You don't pose much of a challenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then revealed the cores of five undersea beasts he had killed and said, "These belong to your Shark Tribe, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shark Tribe's faces turned grim at the sight of the glowing cores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One voice trembled, "Saint Envoy! All five of our Saint Envoys were killed by you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation shocked the Nuer Tribe, who understood the significance of the Saint Envoy to the Shark Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Marcus asked, "You mean these beasts were your Tribe's Saint Envoys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had noticed during their fight that the undersea giants lacked spirit, indicating they were mere demonic beasts without human emotions or intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't understand how such a beast could be a Saint Envoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shark Tribe's expressions darkened, and they looked at Marcus with cold eyes. For a moment, no one answered his question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus was very curious, Raphael leaned in and whispered to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately couldn't help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Raphael, it turned out that the men of the Shark Tribe had no rights to mate or reproduce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the women in the tribe could only reproduce with Saint Envoys sent from a sacred force outside the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they gave birth to children. The boys became soldiers of the Shark Tribe, while the girls were responsible for the reproduction of the next generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Saint Envoys, those giant sea beasts, arrived at irregular intervals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They appeared at intervals of years, decades, or even centuries, leading women to endure endless waiting for the opportunity to reproduce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many waited until old age, but not for the arrival of the so-called Saint Envoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus arrived in this underwater realm, he coincided with the emergence of five Saint Envoys, whom he killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people of the Shark Tribe were still unaware of this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Marcus extract the cores from the five giant beasts, extreme anger appeared among the tribe members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been thirty years since the last Saint Envoy had visited the Shark Tribe, meaning no births had occurred in the past thirty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This absence severely impacted the tribe's legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shark Tribe's women had been hoping for the Saint Envoy's arrival, but their hopes were dashed by Marcus' actions, which eliminated their chance for prosperity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the tribe's customs, Marcus couldn't help but laugh at their peculiar reproductive rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "That's really interesting. No wonder you are so bloodthirsty and brutal. You're all descendants of beasts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words further incited the Shark Tribe's anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah snarled, "You killed five of our Saint Envoys, cutting off our chance to prosper. Holy God won't let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Holy God was the entity controlling the Shark Tribe's fate, likely residing beyond the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus realized that his actions had offended someone powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't care about it. He had no intention of provoking these five beasts, but they attacked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only acted in self-defense against the five beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they sought revenge, he would respond with full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always believed that strength could overcome any adversity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Graham, this man has ruined our chance to thrive. We must destroy him!" </span><span>Rusell</span><span> exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His daughter was now thirty years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Shark Tribe, women typically lost fertility by forty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, the arrival of the Saint Envoy was his daughter's only chance to reproduce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this opportunity was ruined by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was equivalent to making him without any descendants. He couldn't bear such a blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the Shark Tribe echoed </span><span>Rusell's</span><span> sentiments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus destroyed Micah's cultivation with one strike, their numbers gave them confidence in overpowering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Micah nodded immediately. His hatred for Marcus was the strongest. Naturally, he hoped to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A senior figure from the Shark Tribe roared, rallying the crowd to attack Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Destructive forces surged toward him from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael frowned, contemplating sending the Nuer Tribe to assist Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus waved him off, saying, "You don't need to intervene. Just watch me kill!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
