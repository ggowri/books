  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-haired girl glared at Marcus with a look of disgust, clearly not pleased to run into him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus set his luggage down and replied, "I didn't expect to see you again either. What a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I really didn't mean any harm earlier&mdash;please don't call me a pervert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a withering look and retorted, "You think you can just act like that and not face the consequences? What kind of man are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a mix of anger and amusement. "The police cleared me of any wrongdoing. Are you seriously going to judge me based on just your word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-haired girl cursed under her breath and waved the stewardess over. "Can you please change my seat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stewardess approached with a polite smile. "I'm sorry, Miss, but the seats on this flight are fixed, and we can't accommodate a change."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I want to upgrade to first class," the long-haired girl demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stewardess's smile remained apologetic. "Unfortunately, first class is fully booked, and we can't offer you an upgrade. I hope you understand, Miss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, the girl sat down with a look of frustration, having nowhere to direct her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stayed silent, leaning back in his seat with his eyes closed, waiting for the plane to take off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting next to Marcus made the long-haired girl feel increasingly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she couldn't contain herself any longer. She pulled out a rope from her backpack, separating the two seats, and said, "Don't cross the line, or there will be consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amused, Marcus wondered why she hated him so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she really just have a problem with all men?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plane took off quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone switched their phones to airplane mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid boredom, Marcus planned to sleep all the way to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the long-haired girl pulled out a book and began reading intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that Marcus noticed her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her bad temper, she was tall, had delicate features, and smooth skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked to be only a year or two older than Natalia, probably a college student.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then noticed that the book she was reading was about fighting techniques, detailing professional combat methods, some of which were even lethal techniques that were banned in the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sparked Marcus's curiosity about her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was intriguing to see such a young and attractive girl studying fighting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if sensing his gaze, she shot him a glare and asked, "Why are you peeking at me? What do you think you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and replied, "A lot of the moves in that book lack depth. I practice some fighting skills myself. If you're interested, we could exchange tips."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't bragging; as a Level Three warrior, he could easily spot flaws in common fighting techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl threw him a look of disdain. "Stop bragging. You know fighting techniques?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've seen plenty of guys like you trying to pick me up. Just a warning: don't peek at me again, or I'll call the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly didn't believe that Marcus had any real fighting experience; in her eyes, he was just another creep trying to hit on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sighed, feeling his good intentions go to waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to shut up and closed his eyes, focusing on getting some sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a cold voice rang out from somewhere on the plane, "Everyone raise your hands and don't move! I will shoot anyone who does!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's eyes flew open as he saw several men standing up, pulling guns from their bags and threatening the terrified passengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams filled the cabin, and chaos erupted as many fell into panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stewardesses turned pale and scrambled into a corner, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Marcus understood they were experiencing a hijacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only seen such scenes in movies and never thought he would face one in real life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seemed the hijackers had picked the wrong flight&mdash;they encountered Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to deal with them when the long-haired girl yanked him down. "Don't move! Do you want to get killed? These hijackers are serious&mdash;they've planned this and have guns. They could shoot you at any moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at her, surprised. "We're going to die anyway, so why not give it a shot?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
