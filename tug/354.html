  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's brows furrowed deeply, her expression tightening. "Deputy Cromwell, you must be joking. This pharmaceutical park represents a multi-billion-dollar investment. How could you casually suggest tearing it all down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And besides, every single blueprint and construction plan was reviewed and approved by your department at the start. If there were issues, why didn't anyone bring them up then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that everything is complete, you're trying to dismiss it all with a single sentence? Isn't this outright bullying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle had been silently fuming ever since Cromwell's team showed up late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all her pent-up frustration came pouring out in full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better watch your tone when speaking to the deputy director," warned a tall, lanky man standing behind Oscar, his voice cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar smirked, clearly relishing his position of authority. "You're mistaken. The previous inspector who approved your blueprints has been transferred to Solariae. He's no longer part of our department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think his work was so flawless, why don't you go find him? As for me, it's nearly dark, and I've got no interest in wasting my evening here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his statement, he let out a cold laugh, his face brimming with smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bureaucrats like him, living off public funds, had their own methods for dealing with people like Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what the other party said, they could always find a loophole to exploit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a well-practiced tactic: shift all the blame onto the opposing party or onto colleagues who had already left or been transferred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Michelle started, her frustration clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed with frustration. Words momentarily failed her as she tried to contain her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Oscar had pointed out, the previous inspector who approved their blueprints had been transferred to Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current inspection team was entirely new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this logic, as long as the new team disagreed with the prior approvals, the final inspection for the completed project couldn't move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? If there's nothing else, we'll be leaving now," Oscar said with a mocking chuckle, turning to walk away without even a shred of courtesy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Final approval from the engineering department was critical for the project to proceed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, they couldn't install equipment, secure licenses, or begin production.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This leverage made inspectors like Cromwell powerful figures, often surrounded by business owners desperate to curry favor and avoid delays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it right there," Marcus' voice rang out, stopping Oscar and his team in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar turned, his face a mix of irritation and surprise. "What now? If you've got something to say, spit it out. I don't have all day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Cromwell, can you specify exactly how our construction fails to meet the standards? A detailed list would help us address the issues," Marcus said evenly, his tone steady but firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. "You want a detailed list for a project this size? Impossible. The entire thing is substandard. If you want approval, you'll have to tear it all down and start over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their authority was enormous, and they could bend the rules however they liked without fear of repercussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unchecked power had fostered a culture of arrogance and entitlement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze didn't waver. "In that case, I'll need you to provide an official document outlining the specific violations. Deputy Cromwell, please provide it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' demand was sharp and calculated. Solomia's building regulations clearly required any failed inspection to be documented with an official report. He wasn't giving Cromwell any room to dodge responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' response, however, changed the atmosphere instantly. Those standing behind Oscar froze, their gazes shifting toward Marcus with newfound wariness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly realized that Marcus wasn't someone they could easily manipulate&mdash;he clearly knew the law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar frowned and leaned toward one of his subordinates, muttering under his breath, "Is he right? Does the law really say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cromwell's lack of knowledge was glaring. He wasn't a professional but rather someone who had climbed the ranks through family connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brother, the deputy mayor of Solomia, had secured him the position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Cromwell, he's correct," the subordinate whispered. "This guy knows his stuff. We can't brush him off easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cromwell sneered, his bravado undiminished. "So what? I'm the deputy director. If I refuse to approve it, what can he do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice remained calm, though there was a sharp edge to his words. "So you're saying that as deputy director, you believe you're above the law and can deny inspections on a whim?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's exactly what I'm saying," Oscar replied smugly. "Go ahead and report me. See if I care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus noticed the flush in Cromwell's face and the faint smell of alcohol on his breath. Clearly, the man had been drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the saying goes, "alcohol gives courage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Cromwell hadn't been drinking, perhaps he wouldn't have been so brazenly arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Deputy Cromwell, I admire your confidence. I'll report this to City Hall immediately," Marcus said, his tone even but resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar burst into bold laughter. "You think you can report me? My brother is the deputy mayor of Solomia. City Hall is practically my family's playground. Do you really think you stand a chance?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
