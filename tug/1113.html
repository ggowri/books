  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>creature</span><span> let out a miserable scream, his body was directly blasted away, slamming hard against the cave's cliff wall, killed in one strike!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, the other </span><span>Ophidians </span><span>couldn't help but gasp, never imagining that a prisoner would possess such terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even their strongest member was killed in one strike, so they were surely no match for </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, the remaining </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> scattered and fled, not daring to stay a moment longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span>, however, did</span><span> no</span><span>t want to give these </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was not his bloodthirst.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rather, when facing those who want</span><span>ed</span><span> to kill him, he never show</span><span>ed</span><span> mercy, let alone when these people came to this world with the intent to burn, kill, and plunder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a part of this world, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> also found it necessary to help rid the world of these invaders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Buzz, buzz..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, everyone heard strange sounds accompanied by a wave of </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying Thunderfire Power swirled continuously in his palm, making the space overwhelmingly oppressive, as if turning into a living hell!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a wave of his arm, the terrifying Thunderfire Powe burst forth from his palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They transformed into terrifying rays of thunder and fire, descending like divine punishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, terrifying rumbling sounds echoed continuously, and countless screams reverberated throughout the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the terrifying Thunderfire Powe unleashed by </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, the </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> were utterly unable to resist, their bodies destroyed by the devastating force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than three breaths, the remaining </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> all met their demise, the air filled with a bloody scent and an intense killing intent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene made </span><span>Gertie</span><span>, who was not far away, tremble with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She already knew </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s strength was formidable, killing </span><span>Acquired State</span><span> experts as easily as slicing melons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, he was facing dozens of </span><span>Acquired State</span><span> realm </span><span>Ophidians</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, one of them had reached the </span><span>Acquired State</span><span> </span><span>Three </span><span>level, a strength that few in the entire </span><span>Uswad</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span>ould withstand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet at this moment, when facing </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, these </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> </span><span>could not</span><span> resist at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the </span><span>Acquired State</span><span> </span><span>Three Ophidian</span><span> was easily killed by </span><span>Marcus</span><span> in one strike!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such strength once again shattered </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s understanding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> felt even </span><span>harder</span><span> to see through </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, unsure of the true extent of his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as </span><span>Gertie</span><span> was lost in thought, </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s voice came through, pulling her back to reality.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to the invasion of a powerful enemy, the alarm inside the cave grew increasingly intense, sharp, and piercing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more strong </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> gathered here, each possessing considerable strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this still couldn't stop the two from moving forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the ground covered with corpses and shredded remains, the newly arrived </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This prisoner has killed so many of our kin; we must not let him go and must tear him to pieces!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A serpent man with a cultivation </span><span>o</span><span>f </span><span>Acquired State</span><span> </span><span>Two </span><span>gritted his teeth and said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others nodded one after another, their gazes toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span> and his companion filled with killing intent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, three </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> took the lead in launching a deadly attack on </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> showed no fear, fully unleashing the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Timeless Numinous Energy</span><span> </span><span>swirled around him, enhanced by Thunderfire Power, making him appear like a god of slaughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the attacks of the three, he advanced instead of retreating, directly charging into the encirclement of the</span><span>m</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying Thunderfire Hand Strike, like death warrants, fell one after another, each claiming the life of </span><span>an Ophidian</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In no time, like a tiger among sheep, he completely crushed another wave of the </span><span>Ophidians</span><span>' </span><span>attack </span><span>within five minutes!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s steps hardly stopped as he held </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s hand and continued advancing deeper into the cave!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While advancing, a</span><span>n Ophidian</span><span> hid in the shadows, attempting to ambush him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Little did he know, </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s spiritual </span><span>powers</span><span> had already enveloped the entire space, leaving no movement within beyond his control.</span></p><div class="pagination">
