  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Kiera had cleaned it thoroughly, making it as neat as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, should we go to the bedroom?" Kiera asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last time he treated her, it had been in the bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded casually, unable to hold back a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They walked into the bedroom, and to his surprise, Kiera closed the door behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The small room was dimly lit, and a clothesline stretched across the room with Kiera's personal garments hanging.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, her undergarments weren't anything like the sexy ones Marcus had seen on other girls.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were simple cotton pieces, with no fancy embellishments&mdash;just basic and plain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A light, sweet fragrance lingered in the air, a soft scent that seemed to fit her delicate nature perfectly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For some reason, after Kiera closed the door, Marcus could sense her growing nervousness. Her heart raced, and she looked at him, her voice a little softer than usual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, can we begin the treatment now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera asked, her thoughts drifting back to the sensations from the last time he treated her. She couldn't help but feel a little excited about the upcoming session.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can," Marcus replied. "Come over here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera walked over to him, trying to be as quiet as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sit down," Marcus gestured to the spot next to him, a spot where she could sit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera obediently sat down beside him, so close that the space between them seemed almost nonexistent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two hadn't been this close in a while, and the faint scent of Kiera's perfume filled Marcus' senses, making him feel at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to resist, he pulled her gently into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera let out a small hum, her body stiffening as Marcus' presence enveloped her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt a rush of heat flood through her chest, her heart racing wildly. "Mr. Fitzgerald, aren't you here to treat me?" she asked, her voice shaky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smirked. "This is part of the treatment," he said, his arm tightening around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given the hot weather in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, they both wore light clothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera was dressed in a simple sundress, and Marcus had on a T-shirt and shorts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding her like this, he could feel the curves of her body pressing against his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her chest was flush against his, and he could even hear their hearts beating in sync.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, this treatment method is... unique," Kiera murmured, sensing the growing tension.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Held tightly in his arms, she was both nervous and thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be in the arms of a man she liked&mdash;it felt so right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her heart raced even faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Would you like to try a more... unique method of treatment?" Marcus asked, his voice a little hushed, with a teasing tone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera blinked her wide eyes, staring at Marcus with curiosity. "I'm kind of curious, Mr. Fitzgerald. As long as I don't get infected, I'll do anything you ask..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gently cupped her soft, smooth face in his hands, his gaze locked on her demure features.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slowly, he leaned in closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus' face moved closer to hers, Kiera's heartbeat quickened, a fluttering sensation filling her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, Marcus kissed her soft, tender lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The brief touch felt electric, sending a jolt through her body, freezing her in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A warmth surged through her veins, and she felt an immediate response deep inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this what you meant by a more unique treatment?" Kiera asked between breaths, her heart pounding in her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she had experienced some tension with Marcus before, this kind of intimacy was new to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the heat of the moment, his kiss ignited something in her&mdash;a desire she hadn't anticipated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's body responded to him without thinking, and though part of her was overwhelmed, she couldn't deny the strange pleasure of being in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you like it?" Marcus asked softly, lifting his head just enough to meet her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were gentle, his voice low, filled with a tenderness that seemed to sweep her up entirely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I do..." Kiera whispered, the words slipping out almost against her will.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as they left her lips, she felt a rush of heat flood her cheeks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She regretted the words immediately. Being a woman, saying something like that felt embarrassing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
