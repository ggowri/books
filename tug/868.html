  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' personal strength was clear, so of course, he wasn't intimidated by these insignificant people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, it might not have been appropriate to describe Preston and Finley as "insignificant" given their status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in front of Marcus, those words were absolutely fitting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the start of the incident until now, Marcus had simply stood there, unmoving, yet easily controlling the entire situation. His confidence and composure were something Jade had only ever witnessed in Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her admire Marcus even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just the four of them. The other bystanders were also stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined things would end like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, they had thought that Marcus would surely suffer in front of Preston and Finley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was surprising was that throughout it all, Marcus had never once regarded them as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made them realize that this was the true demeanor and aura of someone at the top of the hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, under the watchful eyes of everyone, Lydia walked up to Marcus, gave a respectful military salute, and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I apologize for being late. Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia appeared to be around twenty-five or twenty-six years old, and her military uniform couldn't hide her delicate features and tall, graceful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a soldier, she was also an extremely beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she saluted Marcus respectfully. For everyone watching, it was an incredibly striking sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lightly waved his hand and said to Lydia, "You've done well enough. There's no need for that. Just take care of the aftermath, and I won't stay here long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia saluted again, saying, "Mr. Fitzgerald, don't worry. I'll make sure everything is handled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, Marcus turned his body and said to Jade, who was still in a daze, "You didn't eat well earlier, did you? Let me take you somewhere to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' voice, Jade mechanically nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus took her delicate hand and walked step by step into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade, holding Marcus' hand, felt incredibly tense under the immense aura emanating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she recalled their first meeting on the high-speed train, she realized just how mistaken she had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she had thought Marcus was some sort of pervert, spying on her father's phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "With Marcus' status, how could he possibly be spying on someone's phone number?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even military-grade officers can be dismissed at will&mdash;what level of person must he be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's mind was overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't just a business legend in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, known as Death, but also the Special Advisor to the military, and he possessed an incredible, almost godlike medical expertise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that someone like him was standing right in front of her. She felt incredibly lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, she had a relationship with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything that had happened today was because Ronald had forced her to entertain Aiden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, because of her, Marcus had not only taken care of Aiden and Finley but also dismissed a military officer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something Jade could never have imagined, and it filled her heart with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this, she could tell how much Marcus valued her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, Jade's mind was a chaotic mess, and she didn't know what to think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lydia, watching Marcus and </span><span>Jade walk</span><span> away, wore an expression of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel a strange sense of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being well-respected, she couldn't help but admire Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Lydia was independent and capable, she was still a woman, and like many women, she admired strong, charismatic men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like Marcus, with his power and charm, naturally made Lydia yearn for him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
