  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. Marcus' cultivation level far surpassed that of Norman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he reach Hidden State, but his ability to challenge opponents far stronger than himself made him nearly unbeatable at the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was confident that, at this point, he was strong enough to stand toe-to-toe with any expert at Innate Return Essence Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Norman might as well have been an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he unleashed only a fraction of his power, this opponent wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next instant, the air trembled with a deafening roar, as if the heavens themselves were shaking. A wave of destructive force spread out in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' punch collided with Norman's attack in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could blink, the proud strike of Norman shattered into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had no strength to hold up against Marcus' blow, like paper torn apart under a crushing weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' own attack showed no signs of slowing down. It kept tearing through the air, relentless and unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of a violent explosion rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the Fist Ray of Marcus' punch, everything before Norman was crushed, vanishing into thin air as if it had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With terrifying speed, the punch slammed into Norman's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norman's face twisted in sheer disbelief and terror. He had never imagined that Marcus could be this strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sickening explosion as his body burst apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even scream, Norman was shattered completely, reduced to a cloud of blood mist that scattered with the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stench of blood lingered in the air, overpowering and nauseating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep silence fell over the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that, even in the face of an attack from a Tucker family Grandmaster, Marcus would remain unscathed, effortlessly killing the man with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This display of power shattered everything the onlookers had believed about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood frozen, eyes wide with disbelief, trembling in shock. They couldn't figure out how come Marcus was so young but had such crazy power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's eyes flickered with confusion, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been worried about Marcus moments ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seemed her worries had been entirely misplaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was far beyond anything she had ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you before. You're no match for me. But you wouldn't listen. Now look at where you ended up. You brought this upon yourself," Marcus said, his voice cold as he glanced at the mangled remains of Norman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes shifted to the remaining two Grandmasters. "Why don't you two try your luck together? But don't follow this guy's path. I'm not done having fun yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was laced with arrogant amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two remaining Grandmasters stiffened, their gazes darkening with cold fury. One of them sneered, his voice venomous, "I admit you're strong. But together, the two of us will still put you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of their hands, both Grandmasters unleashed their full power, charging from both sides, ready to destroy him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attacks were nothing short of devastating, releasing every ounce of their power in a ferocious, unrestrained barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, however, had mastered a secret technique that allowed him to tap into his body's hidden reserves, temporarily pushing his power beyond Acquired State Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Grandmaster activated that technique now, his energy surging as he aimed to crush Marcus once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that they were using everything they had, unleashing their most powerful attacks to finish him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were certain that, under these conditions, Marcus wouldn't survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family members watching felt a mix of hope and fear. They couldn't see any way out for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his formidable strength, there was no way he could survive the combined force of two Grandmasters, especially with one of them unlocking the full potential of his body, pushing himself to the limits of his power.</span></p><div class="pagination">
