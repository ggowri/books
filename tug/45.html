  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Miller, there's definitely something strange about this guy. He might even be a monster in human disguise. You absolutely cannot trust him!" Thomas said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' jealousy boiled over as he watched Marcus bask in the spotlight, especially when he noticed Catherine's admiring gaze fixed on him. Driven by uncontrollable envy, he resorted to outright slander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Before Thomas could say more, Charles' sharp rebuke cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles continued, "Thomas, Mr. Fitzgerald's medical expertise surpasses even mine. He is not someone you can insult lightly! If it hadn't been for the fact that I know your father, I'd have fired you on the spot for your disrespect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas's face turned pale, and he dared not speak another word. In his heart, however, a seed of hatred was planted toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had Marcus stolen Catherine, the woman he loved, but Marcus had also caused Charles to lose trust in him. All of this was Marcus' fault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas silently swore if given the chance, he would make Marcus pay the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, if you're willing, our hospital would like to offer you a high-paying honorary consultant position. You would share the same status and privileges as the dean without the need to come to the hospital regularly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In addition, we're hosting a medical academic conference tonight. If you would grace us with your presence, I'm willing to relinquish my position as the keynote speaker for you." Charles extended an olive branch to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could recruit a top-tier expert like Marcus, Marcus would undoubtedly make their hospital famous throughout Uswad! Even the renowned medical institutions overseas would be left far behind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those in attendance were stunned by the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An honorary consultant position with privileges equal to the dean? It was an opportunity most could only dream of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a slight use of his skills, Marcus was able to enjoy the same treatment as the giant of the Solomia medical field. It was impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the nurses, who had previously dismissed Marcus, now looked at him with newfound admiration. They believed that Marcus was the idol they should admire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he young and handsome, but his medical skills also surpassed those of top professors like Charles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If given the chance, they wouldn't hesitate to throw themselves at Marcus, competing fiercely for his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus remained indifferent. He waved off the offer, responding coolly, "I'm not interested in being a medical consultant, nor do I have time for an academic conference. You should look for someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a reply, Marcus turned to Catherine and said, "Mrs. Wilson's cancer has been cured, but her body is still weak from the prolonged illness. Buy her some nutritional supplements. She can be discharged in a week."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus turned and left. Catherine hesitated, wanting to say something to make him stay, but she swallowed her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Marcus is the chairman of Golden Group, and he must have an incredibly busy schedule. That he took time to treat my mother is already more than I could ask for. I shouldn't waste any more of his time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... Could you reconsider?" Watching Marcus walk away, Charles was filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having missed this opportunity, he realized he might never find someone with such exceptional medical skills again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Charles was full of remorse, regretting that he shouldn't have acted so condescendingly in front of Marcus. If only he had been more humble back then, perhaps Marcus would have agreed to his request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was too late. This event taught Charles that, in any case, one should never look down on others!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since his Ferrari had been destroyed in the battle with Brandon and his men, Marcus was now driving a secondhand car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he drove, he began planning his next steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden Group was now entirely under his control, securing his foothold in Solomia's business world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, by taking Serpent's Coil, he had successfully established himself in the underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the consequence of these two actions was that he had offended his two brothers he had never met, which was akin to snatching food from a tiger's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be long before the two of them might seek revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew he had to stay vigilant, not just for his own safety but for the protection of those close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resolved to strengthen himself as quickly as possible. By advancing his mastery of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and expanding his ventures, he could safeguard his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had happened at the hospital had also sparked a new idea. The profitability of the medical sector was no secret. If he could establish a medical company, it would undoubtedly yield significant returns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's thoughts were abruptly interrupted as his secondhand car collided with a bright yellow Lamborghini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you blind? How do you even drive?" A tall, fashionably dressed woman with long hair stepped out of the Lamborghini.</span></p><div class="pagination">
