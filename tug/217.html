You dare to hit me! I'll kill you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's face twisted with fury as he charged at Marcus, gritting his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't give him a chance, swiftly grabbing his wrist and snapping it with a forceful twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an audible crack, Daniel screamed again, writhing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kicked him again, sending Daniel tumbling down the nearby stairs in a pitiful heap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you ever harass my wife again, it won't just be a beating," Marcus warned, dusting </span><span>off his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel howled in pain. He cast a cold glance at Marcus but said nothing as he limped down the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you alright?" Marcus turned to Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie shook her head. "I'm fine. Why didn't you let me know you were coming to Kingston? I could have picked you up from the airport. I've missed you so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she threw herself into Marcus' arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the softness in his embrace and the faint scent that wafted from her, Marcus felt a warmth in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Josie close and leaned down to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie closed her eyes, savoring the tenderness from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she snapped out of the momentary tenderness. "Why are you so eager? This is the hallway. Let's go inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie led him into the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the door was closed, Josie's words were cut off by Marcus' kiss again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kissed her fervently, causing Josie to gasp and her cheeks to flush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?" Marcus asked, kissing her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie panted, "I missed you, darling. I missed you so much. Every day you've been gone, I've dreamt of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stripped off her clothes, lifted her soft body, and carried her towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roughly tossed Josie onto the bed, making her exclaim in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pressed down, hungrily sucking on her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie shuddered, letting out a high-pitched cry, her smooth skin flushing with color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't hold back any longer, quickly removing Josie's pants to reveal her perfect, already damp secret place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could react, Josie had flipped over, knelt in front of him, and taken his stiff member into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately felt a wave of pleasure, closing his eyes to savor it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because it had been too long since they last met, Josie seemed particularly wild, and her actions were bolder than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her teasing, Marcus almost reached his peak prematurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, his cultivation had improved significantly during this period, enhancing his abilities in this aspect as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Josie sucked on Marcus, he continuously played with her breasts with his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense pleasure caused Josie to writhe and twist, quickly reaching a point of unbearable need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay on the bed, spreading her legs as if expecting Marcus' arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as they were about to complete the final act, a loud knock on the door interrupted their passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coward, come out and face your death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's furious roar came from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned at Josie and said, "Wait for me. I'll deal with that audacious man and be right back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well aware of Marcus' strength, so she wasn't worried at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Marcus, dealing with a troublemaker was child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed open the door to find, in addition to the bruised and swollen Daniel, more than a dozen thugs armed with weapons in the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in flamboyant attire and looking menacing, they were clearly individuals who </span><span>frequented the underworld.</span></p><div class="pagination">
