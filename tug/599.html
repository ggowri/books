  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Dustin said this, he waved his hand and shouted, "Retreat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These armed policemen immediately took the order and walked towards the police cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, the several policemen who had arrived with Tim were stunned. They didn't expect Dustin to be so polite to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim's father had a good relationship with the director of the police station, but Dustin had actually given up on helping Tim after seeing Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Dustin's order, Tim yelled, "Stop, Dustin. Your director asked you to help me. You are disobeying the director's orders. Aren't you afraid that you will be fired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin sneered, "I came here on the orders of the director, but if our director knew Mr. Fitzgerald's identity, he would definitely make the same decision as me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth. I didn't help Mr. Fitzgerald arrest you for the sake of your father. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dustin walked towards the police car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim didn't expect Dustin to be so bold that Dustin actually talked to him like this. Tim became angry and roared like a madman, "Just wait and see. I'll call my dad to tell your director to fire you. How dare you be so arrogant in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin ignored Tim, got in the car, and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;people&nbsp;around never expected that Dustin would ignore Tim's threat and simply leave. It seemed that Marcus' status was higher than Tim's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Tim and said sarcastically, "Didn't you say you would let someone blow my head off? I'm waiting for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim was so angry that his face turned red. He gritted his teeth and said, "How dare you mock me? I'll call my dad and ask him to use his connections in Kingston. You are going to die, bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, many people from Darian Logistics Company became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone thought in a panic, "Is Tim finally going to use his family's connections in Kingston? If this is the case, Marcus might be in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people who were familiar with Tim knew that his mother was from the Whitman family, which was a rich family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Tim's mother came from a side branch of the Whitman family, this connection was powerful enough for William and Tim to act at will. Even some famous people in Solomia dared not provoke them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Tim really used the Whitman family's connections, Marcus would probably be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian, Ramona, and Kiera were panicked, not knowing what terrible situation Marcus would face next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary looked at Marcus and sneered, "Dustin dared not do anything to you. Do you think you are safe now? You are no match for Mr. Burton at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you heard of the Whitman family in Kingston? Mr. Burton's mother is from it. You can't stand the Kingston Whitman family's revenge. If you are scared, kneel and apologize to Mr. Burton and agree to his three conditions. Only then you may be able to survive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary said with a sneer, looking at Marcus with a look full of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim took out his cell phone to call his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Tim and sneered, "What is the relationship between your mother and Valentin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Tim became even more arrogant. "Valentin is my uncle. What the hell do you think you are? How dare you call my uncle by his name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Tim finished speaking, Marcus punched him in the abdomen. Tim screamed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "I can make a phone call now and have the Whitman family expel your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, everyone present couldn't help but gasp in shock. Many people thought they had heard it wrong. Even Darian, Ramona, and Kiera couldn't believe what they heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone thought, "Marcus could make a phone call and have the Whitman family expel Tim's mother? How is this possible? Could it be that Marcus is related to the Whitman family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No! Judging from what he said, it's not just a simple relationship. He can command the Whitman family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitman family was known as one of the four major families in Uswad. Although it had suffered some problems some time ago, not everyone could command it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people thought Marcus was bragging. Even some people who came here to watch for fun couldn't help but look at Marcus in contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim laughed with a mocking look.</span></p><div class="pagination">
