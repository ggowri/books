  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera panicked as soon as she heard that. She hurriedly said, "No, no! That's not what I meant! I just meant that next time&hellip; I'll try not to make any noise when we're&hellip; doing that kind of thing&hellip;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Think you can hold it in? Why don't we test it out now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera was so scared that she immediately broke free from Marcus's arms and ran off to the bathroom to shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she was in the bathroom, Marcus sat cross-legged on the bed, using the time to fully stabilize his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Kiera finished her shower, Marcus rinsed off as well, washing away the sweat and feeling instantly refreshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the two finished getting dressed, a heavy knock sounded at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera instinctively opened the door, only to see a plump middle-aged woman standing at the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her curly, frizzy hair was a mess, and she reeked of cigarette smoke, a half-burned cigarette hanging from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Gibson? What are you doing here?" Kiera asked in surprise. The woman, Helen Gibson, was her landlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I rented this place to someone else. You need to move out by tomorrow," Helen declared, with an air of finality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Kiera said, "Mrs. Gibson, didn't I just renew my lease for another six months? I already paid you the rent! How can you suddenly ask me to leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone offered me double the rent. Nothing personal. You've got one day&mdash;by tomorrow, I want this place emptied," Helen replied, her tone completely unapologetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera frowned. "But we signed a contract. The agreement clearly states that you can't rent the place to someone else during my lease. You are breaking the contract right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enraged by those words, Helen put her hands on her hips and sneered, "This is my property. I can rent it to whoever I want. What's the point of arguing? I said move out, so you move out! Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how assertive Helen was, Kiera didn't feel like wasting any more breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Helen had always been unreasonable, and trying to reason with her was a lost cause, so she decided to compromise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Since you're forcing me to leave, I don't have a choice. But at least give me a few days&mdash;tomorrow is a bit too soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And according to our agreement, you owe me two months' rent in compensation. I won't even ask for that&mdash;just return my security deposit, and I'll leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as she finished speaking, Helen snapped, gritting her teeth, "I said you're moving out tomorrow, and that's final! As for the deposit? Don't even think about it. I don't have your deposit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera's face immediately darkened. Furious, she said, "Mrs. Gibson, this is completely unfair. Based on the contract, you're the one breaking the agreement. Not only should you return my deposit, but you also owe me compensation for two months' rent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was willing to let that go, but now you're even refusing to return my deposit? How is that right? If that's how it's going to be, then let's handle this by the book!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera was usually mild-mannered, but that didn't mean she was weak. Helen's bullying was outrageous, and she had had enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, bitch, you want to fight me over this?" Helen spat, her expression vicious. "You're pushing your luck. This is my house, and you'll move out when I say so! And you&hellip;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes darted to Marcus, standing in the room, and a twisted smile spread across her face as she continued, "You brought some random man back here? I wouldn't be surprised if you were selling yourself! And you still have the nerve to ask me for your deposit? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
