  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left his mouth, Miles and Selena both froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, almost in sync, their face displayed sneers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles, especially, gave Chloe a long, appraising look before letting out a sharp laugh. "You know, I tried to be nice to you before, but you acted like I didn't exist. And now? Now that you're in deep shit, you're still worried about this punk? He must've really rocked your world in bed, huh? Damn, you're shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry, sweetheart. Neither of you are getting out of this. You might as well go down together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Miles snapped his fingers, signaling the security team to move in on Marcus and Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The command rang out from the entrance before the guards could take another step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heads turned in unison, eyes snapping toward the source of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people strode inside, their steps sure and purposeful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the charge were a man and a woman&mdash;Evander and Callista.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' smirk faltered, his eyes narrowing slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as he knew, Evander was still just a vice president at Royal Entertainment. He had no idea the man had just been made CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't stop him from scoffing. "And what's this about, Mr. Bishop?" he drawled, arms crossing over his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander's gaze was ice-cold as it swept over him. "Nothing much. Just making sure you don't royally screw yourself over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room stilled. Miles wasn't the only one caught off guard&mdash;Selena and a few others also blinked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell is that supposed to mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All Miles has done is deal with some washed-up actress and her assistant. How could that be a disaster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It is downright baffling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't follow," Miles said, tilting his head. "Mind explaining how I'm 'screwing myself over' here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Evander was a nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, they both carried the same title, but Miles had the years, the connections, and the power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason he'd let Evander run the day-to-day at Royal Entertainment was because he couldn't be bothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Zachary's death, Miles had been the real puppet master behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had his fun&mdash;sleeping with starlets, siphoning off funds&mdash;and left the grunt work to Evander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander barely made five million dollars a year and still acted like cleaning up Miles' messes was some kind of privilege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles, on the other hand? He sat back, collected his money, and lived like a king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when he spoke to Evander now, it was with the same air of condescension he always used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn't stepped in," Evander said, his voice like steel, "you'd have just made the worst mistake of your life by crossing Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander had been sick of Miles for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the bastard had his claws dug deep into Royal Entertainment, his influence woven into every corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy was like a parasite&mdash;too entrenched to rip out without tearing the whole place apart. Evander knew that taking him down alone was a losing battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he gritted his teeth, played along, and waited&mdash;trapped under Miles' thumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the second those words left his mouth, the air in the room shifted. Eyes darted toward him, sharp with curiosity and doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Fitzgerald?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Which Fitzgerald?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who the hell is he talking about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is there some big shot in the crowd that we've missed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We sure as hell haven't heard of any Fitzgeralds making waves in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slow grin spread across Miles' face. "Oh, come on," he scoffed. "You don't mean this guy, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jabbed a finger toward Marcus, a mocking glint in his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen pairs of eyes darted between Marcus and Evander, searching for some kind of explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait... isn't that just Chloe's assistant? Why the hell is Evander calling him 'Mr. Fitzgerald'?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought this must be a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before anyone could challenge it, Evander nodded and said, "Yes. Marcus is the Mr. Fitzgerald I'm talking about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second the words left his mouth, Miles and Selena cracked up, their laughter dripping with ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena smirked, flipping her hair over one shoulder. "Mr. Donovan, are you hearing this? Has Mr. Bishop lost it? He's seriously calling that guy 'Mr. Fitzgerald'? That guy's just Chloe's little lapdog. What kind of joke is this?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
