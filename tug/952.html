  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The level of power Marcus displayed left many people gasping in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian, Fiona, and Alistair looked visibly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of them had expected Marcus to be so good in a fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't expect this guy to be such a powerhouse. No wonder he's been acting so cocky!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if he can fight? I know this karaoke bar is protected by the Serpent's Coil. If the owner tells them about this, just imagine what will happen to him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, the Serpent's Coil is the biggest underground group in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. Word is every member's got a weapon on them. No matter how tough this guy is, once the Serpent's Coil shows up, he's in for a world of hurt!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd murmured nervously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus take down the security guards, they knew he had just made a bigger </span><span>mess for himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair turned to Maximilian. "Don't worry, Mr. Lockwood. This guy laying hands on my men? This isn't over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Alistair turned his cold eyes to Marcus. "You realize you've just signed your own death sentence, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, already losing patience, shot back, "Just say what you need to say. Quit beating around the bush. I don't have time to waste on your nonsense."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's eyes narrowed. He couldn't believe this kid was so bold, even when facing imminent danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sure you heard what people are saying. Our karaoke bar is under the protection of the Serpent's Coil. I'm calling them now, and you'll regret this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alistair spoke, a smug smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, bringing in the Serpent's Coil was about more than just forcing Marcus to kneel and beg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Ravenshaw, call in the Serpent's Coil now! This guy's way too cocky, he's got to pay for what he's done!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona chimed in, egging him on, practically eager to see Marcus put down by the gang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Maximilian's approval, Alistair pulled out his phone and made the call.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Hayes? We've got a situation at the karaoke bar. Can you send some of your guys to handle it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell? Someone's causing trouble on our turf? They've got a death wish. I'm on my way, don't worry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson Hayes' voice crackled with anger through the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson was a captain in the Serpent's Coil, running this entire area with a crew of dozens.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They collected protection money and handled other shady operations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's karaoke bar paid a hefty protection fee to the Serpent's Coil every year.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, anytime there was a problem, the Serpent's Coil had Alistair's back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This gave Alistair the confidence to handle anything that came his way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the Serpent's Coil behind him, he knew there was no one who could touch him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People from both the legal and illegal sides of things, no one dares to mess with the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even better, if he could handle this for Maximilian, he would lock down a steady business relationship with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies branch was up and running, Maximilian would be a regular at his karaoke bar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That meant serious money for Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You just wait, kid. Mr. Hayes is on his way with the Serpent's Coil. Let's see how cocky you are then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, Alistair turned to Marcus with a cold, mocking smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Alistair's words, the crowd couldn't help but gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected Alistair to bring in Orson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those familiar with the area knew Orson was a brutal, no-nonsense leader who had recently been promoted within the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His ruthlessness, decisiveness, and ability to get things done quickly had earned him the favor of Jalen, who made him a captain and put him in charge of this district.</span></p><div class="pagination">
