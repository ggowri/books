The Celestial Arc Order, one of the three great Ancient Martial Art sects in Uswad, would be no match for her. It was beneath her dignity to deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, Ada returned to her sect. Having been defiled by Marcus, she had contemplated suicide but couldn't bring herself to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had struggled with the pain, trying countless ways to forget the ordeal, but the memories haunted her. She actually felt relished whenever she thought about the pleasure she had experienced. And this made her feel guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada berated herself for her depravity. She thought, "I was being assaulted. How could I feel any pleasure? Could it be that I actually enjoyed it? No, I am pure and chaste. I would never indulge in such debauchery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With conflicted emotions, Ada returned to the sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Colby?" Millet asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada replied, "He was killed by that man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news sent shockwaves through the sect. Colby was a peak Ancient Martial Stage Six expert. He had been at that level for many years and was considered one of the strongest in his realm. He could even hold his own against some newly promoted Ancient Martial Stage Seven experts. It was inconceivable that such a powerful figure could be killed by a young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet found this hard to believe. "If he is dead, how did you survive? What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada blushed at his question. She swallowed the words that were about to spill out. She gathered her thoughts and replied, "I was just lucky to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lucky? You're far luckier than him," Millet remarked, sensing something amiss about Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other elders felt the same. There was something different about Ada, but they couldn't quite put their finger on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the elders stepped forward and pleaded, "That man is a disgrace! He has killed our Grand Elder and many other elders. We beseech you, Mr. Spacey, to take revenge and slay him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others echoed his plea, "Yes, please, Mr. Spacey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet's eyes flickered as he stood up. "As you wish," he declared. "I shall depart immediately for Solomia and put an end to this villain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of powerful energy emanated from Millet. He had reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Seven and had been at that level for years. He was far more formidable than Colby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet was confident that Marcus stood no chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders erupted in cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a discordant voice cut through the air. "Mr. Spacey, you must not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ada. All eyes turned to her, filled with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that?" Millet asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus Fitzgerald is far too powerful. He killed Colby with one blow, and I was no match for him," Ada replied. "So, I think, Mr. Spacey, you should abandon the idea of revenge for now and focus on strengthening our sect. We can think about revenge later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Ada desperately wanted revenge, she had to be rational after witnessing Marcus' terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after reaching Ancient Martial Stage Seven, Ada couldn't withstand Marcus' power. She believed their sect leader, Millet, was no match for Marcus. If Millet acted rashly, they would pay a heavy price. And that would mean the end of the Celestial Arc Order. As the Saintess in the sect, she couldn't allow that to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is just a youth in his twenties. Even if he could kill Colby, he's no match for me," Millet scoffed, clearly disbelieving Ada. He was highly confident in his own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada tried to reason with Millet further, but Millet waved her off. "There's no need to say more. My mind is made up!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
