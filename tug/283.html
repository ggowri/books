  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus got up from his seat, stretched, and then said to Andre, "You're the secretary-general of the Municipal Government in Solomia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre was somewhat surprised by his attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had talked to him like this for a long time. "Yeah, you got a problem with it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then you must know Adam, right?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adam was the director of the Architecture Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marcus attended Nicole's parents' meeting, he had a conflict with Adam's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adam was seized by the Department of Justice and under investigation of receiving a bribe of 10 million dollars from Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Michelle, Adam had a close relationship with Andre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre took advantage of the change in his position and helped Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two were involved in corruption, which was mentioned in the survey results of the Department of Justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the case was still in the final approval process, and the convict had not been announced for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So Andre only knew Adam was caught, but he didn't realize that the danger was approaching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Andre frowned, "Adam is a corrupt criminal. Why did you mention him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And I'm warning you. I'm not familiar with him, so don't frame me, or I'll order someone to arrest you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre acted all worked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So it was a little taboo to mention Adam in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his people were caught and he was frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he took out his phone and checked his chat record with Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amelia had been reporting to Marcus about some specific details of Adam's case investigation these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several of them involved Andre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he picked out one and said, "On May 28, 2024, Adam received a bribe of eight million dollars from the construction company and gave you three million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On June 29, 2024, Adam withheld construction workers' wages and profited four million dollars. And you made 1.5 million dollars out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On July 23, 2024, Adam made a profit of six million dollars from kickbacks on building materials and gave you two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't tell me that you don't remember all these things." Marcus looked at Andre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was so loud that everyone present could hear him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many were stunned in place, especially Andre, Emma, and the rest of Rivera Construction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their faces looked livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you talking about? I have never received money from Adam. If you say it again, believe me, I will have the police arrest you right now!" Andre panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because everything Marcus said was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know who this young man was and why he knew so much confidential information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you to frame my uncle? Oh, I see. You must be dissatisfied with Rivera Construction winning the bid, so you are trying to sabotage us, aren't you?" Emma's voice came with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just ask him whether I had framed him. I will say no more." Marcus shrugged and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Amelia messaged him again and told him that Adam's case had been thoroughly investigated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides Adam, several other big shots were involved, including Andre, the secretary general of the municipal government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre had protected Adam for years and allowed his corruption and bribery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he received huge amounts of property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Department of Justice had obtained sufficient evidence and would announce it to the public soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guards. Arrest this filthy liar and send him to the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre didn't want to listen to Marcus' nonsense anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every word Marcus said made him tremble and he panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, several municipal government workers wanted to catch Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina looked nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she knew Marcus was not an ordinary person, Andre was the secretary-general of the municipal government, who they couldn't offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus would offend such a person for her. Melina was both guilty and worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave Melina a reassuring look. "Andre, you're at death's door and yet you don't know it. Within one minute, you will receive a call from the municipal government."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre's heart sank. However, he thought Marcus was just trying to scare him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This man was too young to know everything.</span></p><div class="pagination">
