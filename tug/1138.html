  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus seemed unwilling to waste more words with Roger. He stood with his hands behind his back, exuding immense arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger's face turned icy as he mocked, "I'm curious to see how you'll suppress me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he summoned his strongest power once again, unleashing a terrifying attack toward Marcus with frenzy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus showed no fear. As he pushed the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to its peak, terrifying Hand Strikes came one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His attacks clashed continuously with Roger's, and the destructive force spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gradually, Roger's expression grew darker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus's attacks were so powerful that he couldn't withstand them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Roger couldn't endure it and spat out a mouthful of blood. His face turned extremely pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was surrounded by terrifying power, floating in the void. With a cold expression, he asked Roger, "I'll ask you again, are you willing to submit to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger remained stubborn and shouted, "You want me to submit to you? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his heart, he was the king of this world, and no one could make him submit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially in his view, Marcus, a bastard, was even less qualified to give him orders!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since that's the case, don't blame me for being ruthless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Roger still persistent, Marcus no longer held back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus unleashed his strongest aura, and a terrifying destructive force burst out wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing that overwhelming pressure, Roger's forehead was covered in cold sweat. He simply couldn't resist it anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, he was completely subdued under one of Marcus's attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will fight you to the death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Roger still seemed unwilling to submit and even attempted a deadly sneak attack on Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus naturally wouldn't forgive him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Fist Ray from him suddenly struck Roger's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger spat out a mouthful of blood, screaming in agony. He had completely lost the ability to fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus grabbed Roger and sneered, "So, is this the strength you're so proud of? You're no match for me. You should have submitted to me earlier."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present felt their hearts skip a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never dreamed that Marcus's strength would be this powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, his cultivation was only at Innate State One, yet he could overpower Innate State Four's Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Throughout the entire fight, Marcus had a clear advantage, completely overpowering Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This outcome completely exceeded everyone's expectations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing Roger under Marcus's control, Alison in the distance was extremely worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth, took a step forward, and pleaded, "Marcus, could you spare Roger's life for my sake?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone squinted, unsure why Alison felt entitled to plead with Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, from their conversation, they seemed very familiar with each other. Everyone was puzzled about what was going on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For your sake? Why should I care about your sake?" Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison muttered, "Because I slept with you. Does that work?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present looked at her in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected that two seemingly unrelated people would have such a connection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, Alison was Roger's woman. They couldn't understand why she slept with Marcus or what was going on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alison, what are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Alison's words clearly, Roger instantly became furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Roger, I'm sorry. I lied to you. I betrayed you. I'm not a good woman. I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's eyes filled with tears as she apologized to Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You wretch, you're such a wretch! How dare you betray me! I never thought you'd be such a shameless person!" Roger roared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he stayed away from women, he still couldn't accept his woman being with another man!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, I beg you to spare Roger. I'll do anything as long as you let him go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison knew that if this matter became public, her reputation would be ruined, and she would face Roger's resentment, completely breaking their relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she had no choice. To keep Roger alive, she could only resort to this method to persuade Marcus to spare Roger's life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's words surprised Marcus greatly. He said, "I can spare his life, but he must face punishment!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he punched Roger's Spirit Core.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud rumble echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger let out a scream, completely reduced to a cripple!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus casually tossed him onto the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked the crowd, "Anyone unwilling to submit to me can step forward and speak. I'm ready to fight anytime!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger was easily subdued by Marcus, so no one would willingly seek death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Bruce fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, one of Ryan's subordinates respectfully greeted Marcus, expressing his determination to submit to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, everyone immediately greeted him respectfully, supporting him to take over the position of Godfather.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Bruce had no choice but to submit to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger felt he had lost all support and was utterly desperate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Marcus firmly secured the position of Godfather. No one dared to oppose him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the turmoil in this world grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the spatial barriers gradually weakened, more and more experts from beyond the Ice Wall arrived in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them were many formidable figures. They made this world even more turbulent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the third day after Marcus assumed the position of Godfather, Roderick appeared in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing that his subordinates were brutally killed by Marcus, Roderick immediately set out to seek revenge against him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's cultivated to an Innate State of Seven, so he's unusually strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in recent days, after obtaining Ryan's cultivation resources, Marcus's strength has also advanced rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation is now an Innate State Three. In the face of Roderick's challenge, he is not afraid to fight with Roderick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really think you have the strength to withstand my attack?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the void, Roderick stood proudly, glanced at Marcus, and revealed an extremely mocking smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then you can go ahead and try. There's no need to waste words with me here. After our battle, we'll know who's stronger!" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had fully unleashed his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Rolling Timeless Numinous Energy swirled around him, exuding immense battle power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He launched the first attack on Roderick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus's speed was terrifying, catching Roderick off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roderick was in a tough spot. As the battle began, he was immediately at a disadvantage, completely suppressed by Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to unleash all his potential to try to regain his advantage, but he never succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wasn't afraid of his attacks at all and fully unleashed his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One terrifying attack after another kept coming at Roderick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It didn't take long before he couldn't hold on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never dreamed that Marcus, despite being so young, could be this powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a moment of crisis, Roderick tried to escape using a teleportation amulet. However, to his shock, Marcus could teleport.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Roderick could escape, Marcus used teleportation to lock onto his body and immediately caught up with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Marcus used Devouring Power to absorb all of Roderick's energy, causing his cultivation to skyrocket, directly reaching Innate State Five!</span></p><div class="pagination">
