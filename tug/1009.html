  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't!" One of the Three Guardians screamed in desperation as Marcus' punch hurtled toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to evade, but it was hopeless. There was no time left to escape, only to brace himself as the punch swallowed him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening crash followed, and in an instant, his body exploded into a spray of blood and flesh, torn apart by the overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' punch didn't lose any of its momentum. In the blink of an eye, the remaining two Guardians were consumed by the same destructive power, their bodies obliterated just like their comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single strike, Marcus had eradicated the Tucker family's three strongest warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser stood frozen, staring at the scene in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind struggled to process what he had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this young man, so seemingly unremarkable, have destroyed the Four Guardians without breaking a sweat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that final, earth-shattering punch, obliterating three of them in an instant, was beyond anything he could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's body trembled, and his eyes filled with pure terror. He couldn't tear his gaze away from Marcus, who stood unfazed by the devastation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance at the fallen Guardians. His cold, unwavering eyes locked onto Yasser. "Where is Gertie? Tell me, now. If you don't, your fate will be the same as theirs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had no deep personal attachment to Gertie, she was someone he had shared a night with, and more importantly, she was Ada's cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ada had arrived, the worry in her eyes for Gertie had been clear, and that alone made Marcus feel compelled to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's... in the family dungeon," Yasser stammered, his voice now shaking with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gone was the arrogance he once held. Only dread and submission remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally realized the truth. Marcus' power was beyond anything he or the Tucker family could contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Devon and Gertie had warned him before. He had made a grave mistake underestimating this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of regret swept through him. If only he hadn't been so foolish, maybe he wouldn't be standing here, face-to-face with his impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to her, now," Marcus commanded, his tone as sharp as a blade. "Or I'll end you right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser nodded frantically, too terrified to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expected Marcus would either fly or take a plane to the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't anticipate was the flash of spatial forces that burst from Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the space around them seemed to warp, and Yasser felt the world spin violently. His vision blurred into darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it cleared, he was stunned to find himself standing in the heart of the Tucker Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His jaw dropped in disbelief. He had never imagined Marcus possessed teleportation abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it clicked. Yesterday, when Marcus left, he showed similar powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he had assumed it was just a short-range trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Kinton Mountains were over 2485 miles away from Solomia, yet Marcus had moved them here in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was even more mind-boggling was that this area was protected by Illusion Runes set up by the numerous Ancient Martial Art families living in the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outsiders couldn't see what lay behind them, and even teleporting wouldn't have broken through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place, the Tucker family's domain, was a world apart from the one outside. It was a hidden paradise, lush and serene, with mountains and rivers that seemed to breathe life into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast to the desolate, barren lands of the surrounding region, this area was filled with spiritual energy, almost as if the entire landscape was alive with power.</span></p><div class="pagination">
