  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be the Grandmaster, right?" Marcus stood with hands at his sides, and his sharp gaze was fixed on the figure before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell that his opponent was a Stage Seven ninja, someone who had clearly spent years consolidating their cultivation with a solid foundation and stable mastery of the realm. In that sense, Grandmaster had a natural advantage over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you know who I am, why haven't you knelt in submission?" Grandmaster's childlike voice echoed ominously, carrying an air of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That depends on whether you have the skill to make me," Marcus replied with a cold smirk, and his tone was calm and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Fury flashed in Grandmaster's eyes as he was provoked. With a sharp cry, he pointed a finger, unleashing a devastating beam of light born from ninja techniques that hurtled down from the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sidestepped effortlessly, evading the attack. A deafening explosion followed as the beam struck the ground, leaving a massive crater in its wake. The sheer destructive force left the onlookers gasping in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandmaster's eyes gleamed with malice as his figure suddenly descended from the void. "Let's see how long you can keep dodging." His voice was icy, and his movements were precise and relentless as he unleashed a flurry of ninja techniques that sealed off every escape route around Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' Shadow Step made him elusive, and his figure darted through the barrage of attacks with fluidity. In a flash, he closed the distance between them, appearing directly before Grandmaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus threw a punch. His Timeless Warrior's Grimoire roared to life as he infused his attack with Timeless Numinous Energy and Thunderfire Power, creating an overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Foolish." Grandmaster's face twisted into a disdainful sneer. Though Marcus' cultivation appeared to rival his own, Grandmaster was utterly confident in his ability to kill this upstart effortlessly. The reason was simple. He had lingered in this realm for many years, cultivating a solid foundation that Marcus could only dream of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' attack hurtled toward him, Grandmaster summoned his most powerful ninja technique from deep within, countering Marcus' Fist Ray with overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying sound of their collision echoed across the heavens as waves of destructive energy rippled outward, tearing through the surrounding area. In the aftermath of the clash, Grandmaster stood triumphant, and a smug smile curled at the edges of his lips. He had gained the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as his grin began to widen, it froze&mdash;and then slowly dissolved into an expression of disbelief. Because on the surface of Marcus' fist, alongside the Thunderfire Power and Timeless Numinous Energy, a far more sinister Rune Totems emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intricate patterns surged forward, like a spider's web, and swiftly entangled Grandmaster's body. His eyes widened in panic. Desperately, he unleashed ninja techniques in an attempt to dispel the runes. But Marcus wouldn't give him that chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping forward, Marcus unleashed another terrifying Fist Ray. Its destructive momentum forced Grandmaster to focus entirely on defense. The Rune Patterns combined with the destructive force made Marcus' attacks relentless and devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uswadian scum! You dare use underhanded tactics against me! I'll make you suffer for this!" Grandmaster snarled through clenched teeth, and his gaze was fixed on Marcus, seething with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as he spoke, his fingers flickered, sending sharp, chilling glints streaking toward Marcus in the blink of an eye. These were ninja-exclusive hidden weapons, and in Grandmaster's hands, their power was multiplied several times over. A single strike would be fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reacted swiftly, dodging to the side. Though he evaded most of the projectiles, one managed to graze his arm, leaving a shallow cut that oozed fresh blood. But Marcus hardly seemed to care. His mind focused, automatically channeling Heavenly Circle Diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rune patterns spiraled around his palm, merging seamlessly with his Thunderfire Power and Timeless Numinous Energy, pushing the strength of his Fist Ray to a fearsome new height. The Fist Ray, like an unrelenting storm, rained down on the Grandmaster's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, the Grandmaster struggled to keep up, momentarily overwhelmed by the ferocity of the assault. As their attacks collided, it became clear he was at a disadvantage. Especially with the Rune patterns augmenting Marcus' power, the gap between their strengths widened with every passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're a Rune Crafter?" Grandmaster stammered with disbelief etching across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rune Crafter? That's just the beginning," Marcus sneered. With a swift motion, he unleashed both Lightning and Firebolt in tandem, sending the combined attack hurtling toward Grandmaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus' magic was only at Stage Five, its precision disrupted Grandmaster's focus, subtly distorting his judgment of Marcus' true intentions. It was this moment of miscalculation that Marcus exploited. Three devastating Fist Rays followed in rapid succession. One struck its mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandmaster was sent flying, and blood gushed from his mouth as he crashed to the ground. While ninjas were renowned for their speed and agility, their techniques often left their defenses vulnerable. The single punch Marcus landed had inflicted critical damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers from Black Dragon Society watched in horror, their faith crumbling. To them, their Grandmaster was akin to a divine figure, an invincible force. Yet here he was, utterly crushed by this young Uswad warrior. The sight left them trembling, their once-unshakable belief shattered in an instant.</span></p><div class="pagination">
