  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Jerry spoke, both Ramona and Kiera's faces darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's voice was sharp as he responded, "There's nothing I can't agree to, but not this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's smug grin grew wider. "Come on, think about it. Jaxon's got his eye on your wife. Let her go with him, Kiera can stay with me&mdash;it's a win-win. And if you agree, I'll wipe out your debt of 100 thousand dollars bucks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were glued to Kiera, the greed in them unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's blood boiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You son of a&mdash;" He didn't even finish his sentence before he swung a powerful punch at Jerry's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry didn't even have time to react before the punch landed, sending him sprawling. Enraged, he scrambled to his feet, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You piece of crap! You dare lay a hand on me?! I swear I'll break you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Jerry's goons surged forward, launching a brutal attack on Darian, fists and feet flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold voice rang out, cutting through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry and his men froze, turning to see Marcus approaching slowly, his expression as unreadable as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And who the hell are you? You looking to play hero?" Jerry sneered, eyeing Marcus with a mix of contempt and menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your man hit mine. Now you'll pay for it," Marcus said, his voice low but full of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry raised an eyebrow, scoffing. "What's it to you? So, I hit your guy. You think you can do something about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Jerry could finish speaking, Marcus struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift punch, he sent Jerry crashing to the ground. His two front teeth flew out, and blood poured from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry lay there, groaning in pain, his anger escalating. "You little shit, you're dead now. I'm going to make you regret this." He shouted to his men, "Get this bastard! Beat him into the ground. Whatever happens, I'll take the fall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group of black-clad thugs closed in on Marcus, surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men leading the charge sneered. "You dare hit Jerry? You'll pay with at least two broken arms for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they advanced on Marcus, their knives gleaming, Darian rushed forward, positioning himself between Marcus and the attackers. "Mr. Fitzgerald, this is my mess. You need to get out of here, for your own good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus gave him a reassuring glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a defiant smirk, Marcus crooked his finger at the attackers, daring them to come at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sneered, pulling out their knives and rushing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The women, Ramona and Kiera, gasped in horror, watching as the situation escalated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus wasn't fazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His fists moved with lethal precision, each punch landing with devastating force, sending one attacker after another crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few minutes, all of Jerry's men were either sprawled on the ground or writhing in pain, unable to continue the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, Ramona, and Kiera stood frozen, stunned by the spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had no idea that Marcus was this formidable&mdash;not just rich and skilled in medicine, but also a powerhouse in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's men, who were supposed to be tough, had no chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were the same men who ran security for Jerry's businesses, trained and ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus had taken them down without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's face was now a mask of rage and disbelief. "You've got some nerve, boy. You think you can just come into my territory and make a scene? You better think about the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus wasn't even listening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked slowly toward Jerry, his gaze cold and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, he kicked up one of the knives lying on the ground and caught it in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's face twisted in fear as he saw Marcus holding the blade. "What do you think you're doing? Don't be an idiot. You don't know who you're messing with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a word, Marcus grabbed Jerry's right arm and brought the knife down in one clean swipe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of the blade cutting through flesh echoed in the air as Jerry's right hand fell to the ground, blood gushing from the stump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry screamed in agony, his eyes wide with terror and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard! You chopped off my arm! I swear, I'll make you regret this. You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's voice cracked with fury as he glared at Marcus, his face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stared back at him with a cold, calculating look. "You hit my man. I'm not going to let that go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a final, dismissive snort, he stuck the knife into the ground, sending a tremor of fear through Jerry's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've got guts, I'll give you that," Jerry spat, still writhing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you'll pay for this, and it's going to cost you more than you can imagine."</span></p><div class="pagination">
