  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hank," </span><span>Ryker</span><span> said, his tone still calm but firm. "Now, what do you have to say for yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank's face was filled with despair as, in a moment of utter defeat, he suddenly collapsed to his knees in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trembled as he pleaded, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I didn't know who you were. If I had known your true identity, I wouldn't have dared to disrespect you, not even for a second. Please, show mercy. Don't hold my offenses against me. I beg you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Hank completely humbled himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that everything that had led to this point was entirely his own fault for crossing Marcus, someone he now recognized as far beyond his reach. If he lost his position as </span><span>the City Governer </span><span>of Solomia, it wasn't just jail time that awaited him&mdash;it would drag his entire family down with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of this realization crushed Hank's spirit. As he begged Marcus, the arrogance and pride he once had were nowhere to be found. All that remained was fear, desperation, and a desperate plea for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter and his wife watched in stunned silence. They couldn't believe their eyes. The mighty Hank Foster, who had always been their figure of authority, their City Governer, was now kneeling before Marcus like a dog, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, Hank had arrived with all the swagger of a high-ranking official. But now, he was a completely different person, his pride shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just Dexter and the others, but even the neighbors who were witnessing this scene couldn't help but feel a shift in their perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank had always been an unreachable figure on TV or in the media&mdash;someone high above them, above reproach. But now, to see him groveling before Marcus, their image of him was completely upended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Hank a cold glance, a mocking smile curling on his lips. "Weren't you the one who kept saying Uswad's laws didn't apply to you? Weren't you the one threatening me, promising to make me pay? And now, look at you, begging for mercy. Doesn't it feel ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with a ripple of agreement, especially from the neighbors who knew the full story. They couldn't help but scoff at Hank, Dexter and his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the wife's insistence on withholding Marcus's girlfriend Kiera's deposit, none of this would have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the entire ordeal, the Dexter and his wife had been trying to use their influence and connections to suppress Marcus and Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't had such an important status, there was no doubt that the three people would have crushed him by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that Marcus had revealed his true identity as the Special Military Advisor, Hank was reduced to begging for mercy. It was a stunning fall from grace for those who had once admired him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the onlookers couldn't help but cast sarcastic glances at Hank, who had once seemed so untouchable in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank's face paled as Marcus's words sank in. Despair filled him. His heart was a storm of regret, wondering why he had ever backed Dexter and his wife. If he hadn't tried to stand up for them, he wouldn't have provoked Marcus, and none of this would have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it was too late. His clash with Marcus had brought the full force of the city military down on him. Uswad's higher-ups had taken notice and had already collected detailed evidence of his wrongdoings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of what awaited him made Hank almost wish he could kill Dexter and his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dexter, what do we do now? Are we going to prison?" Helen's voice was filled with panic as she turned to Dexter for answers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
