With the gradual development of the underwater oil field, the profit will definitely increase annually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Considering the reserve capacity of the underwater oil field, it has the potential to be exploited for a minimum of 10 years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just think about how much wealth I'll possess by that time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't mean to bring this up, but I couldn't help it. You're so short-sighted, focusing solely on this guy's 20 billion dollars and overlooking me, a future billionaire. It's truly absurd!" Atlas said with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately dumbfounded the Vance family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It never crossed their minds that Atlas, who was just a sales manager, actually had such formidable ways of making money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A yearly profit of 30 billion dollars was truly astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Atlas was on such good terms with the vice president of Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Atlas had stated, he was, without a doubt, a future billionaire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne, Edwin, and Cora became friendly again towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne and Edwin were even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their surprise, Natalie was so valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to get her, Atlas did not hesitate to reveal such a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Payne and Edwin were partial towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the support of Bayside Petroleum Company, Atlas' annual earnings amounted to 30 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, according to what he said, that underwater oil field could keep on being developed for more than a decade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Profits would increase year by year during the period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten years later, Atlas would definitely have several hundred billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus only put forward 20 billion dollars, and he was nowhere near as wealthy as Atlas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin immediately stepped forward and said obsequiously, "Atlas, don't be angry. My father is in his dotage. Don't bother with him. I always regard you as Natalie's future husband. I firmly believe that no one else can replace you. Atlas, don't worry. Natalie will only marry you. Other men don't stand a chance at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas smiled with satisfaction and glanced at Marcus with an increasingly arrogant gaze. "Well, are you aware of the situation? Do you think it's impressive to take out 20 billion dollars as a gift? Maybe I'm not as rich as you now, but in three months, my assets will surpass yours. Be sensible and leave immediately. Don't spoil my mood here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words reminded Marcus of something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some time ago, Hector Olson, vice president of Bayside Petroleum Company, reported to him about the newly discovered underwater oil field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as per his statement, the annual output value of this underwater oil field was merely in the range of 30 to 40 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The duration of development would be no more than five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Hector's words were true, the underwater oil field was not remarkable compared to the numerous oil fields of other petroleum companies in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, based on Atlas' account, the output of this oil field was at least ten times more than what Hector had mentioned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, it was highly probable that Hector had been lying to Marcus previously in an attempt to hide the oil field's production levels and misappropriate the oil field's profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For senior executives, it was not uncommon to misappropriate a portion of the company's profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Marcus was taken aback by how greedy Hector was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than 100 billion dollars in profits every year was nearly equal to 90% of the total output value of the entire oil field!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, after the oil field was developed, he intended to siphon off 90% of the oil field's profits through covert maneuvers, leaving Marcus with merely 10%!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And out of this 90% profit, 30% belonged to Atlas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having put the matter in order, Marcus couldn't resist sneering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never anticipated that an ordinary meal would lead to his discovery of the corruption secret among the executives of Bayside Petroleum Company!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After calming down, Marcus narrowed his eyes and asked Atlas, "Previously, I heard that the annual output value of the underwater oil field newly developed by Bayside Petroleum Company is merely around 30 to 40 billion dollars. How come it's inconsistent with what you've stated?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His question to Atlas was to get more details from him for evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, he stealthily activated the recording function on his phone simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus intentionally feigned resentment, making Atlas misjudge him as being jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Atlas snorted, "Those are merely presented figures. The actual data is known only to those who are in charge of the development. </span><span>Got</span><span> </span><span>it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were quite implicit, but they were equivalent to an indirect confession that Hector had fabricated oil field data.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, is Mr. Olson misappropriating the profits of Bayside Petroleum Company?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas instinctively nodded, and with an even more pronounced look of pride on his face, he replied, "You can put it that way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in an instant, he lost his temper and growled, "What does it matter to you whether Mr. Olson is misappropriating funds or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you asking these things? Even if you know the truth, what can you accomplish? You're not part of Bayside Petroleum Company."</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
