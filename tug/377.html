  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's body trembled slightly. She was unable to suppress the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strong aura of masculinity that radiated from him made her heart race even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face turned crimson, and she unconsciously took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you doing? I can't exactly eat you, you know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Grace's nervous demeanor, Marcus couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I'm just so nervous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace bit her lip and looked down, too embarrassed to meet Marcus' gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus reached out and gently grasped the clasp of Grace's towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instinctively, Grace tried to stop him, but Marcus only tugged lightly, causing the towel to slide off her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her smooth skin was now fully exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It might have been a trick of the light, or perhaps because of the energy channeling, but Grace's body seemed even more delicate and soft than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace felt she wanted to hide somewhere else from embarrassment, still incredibly self-conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus, with a dominating air, picked her up and laid her flat on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... aren't we moving a bit too fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's breathing became shallow, and her mind involuntarily filled with images of what could come next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tried to calm herself down and braced for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you mean by too fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus froze for a moment, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, aren't you planning to do... that kind of thing to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace blinked her large, innocent eyes as she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few beads of sweat appeared on Marcus' forehead. He hurriedly explained, "The energy channels that need to be cleared are in your lower abdomen, so you need to lie down on the bed for the process to work..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace finally understood, her face flushing even redder. She quickly covered her face in embarrassment. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you should have said something earlier! I thought... I thought you were planning to do something else to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled softly and began to channel the Timeless Numinous Energy. Waves of Numinous Energy surged in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He muttered something under his breath, slowly placing his hand on Grace's flat stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace felt his large hand like the warmth of the winter sun, a wave of heat sinking into her body through her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made her experience again that electrifying, tingling sensation from the other day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But compared to then, this feeling was much stronger, like it was reaching deep into her bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she was enveloped by a wave of pure, overwhelming happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace let out a high-pitched cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body moved restlessly, her lips slightly parted, breathing softly. The seductive sounds echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus felt a surge of heat in his lower abdomen, and certain parts of him began to stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... what is this power? It feels so good... I've never experienced anything like this before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed that after their previous encounter, Grace no longer hid her feelings. She boldly spoke her mind without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Timeless Numinous Energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus answered softly, still delivering the Numinous Energy as it slowly circled Grace's lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The electric sensation instantly grew stronger, causing Grace to instinctively squeeze her legs together and begin shifting them up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She longed to touch her most sensitive spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body convulsed, and her pussy secreted copious amounts of fluid as she once again ascended to the orgasm that all women crave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah... that feels so good... I feel like I'm flying..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace kept panting, gripping Marcus' arm, squeezing it repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... When will my energy channels be unblocked? I can't take it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she reached the orgasm, that overwhelming emptiness returned once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made Grace feel an intense longing for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without meaning to, her long legs parted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes moved down to get a clear view of the mysterious area filled with watery light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The slit was permeated with the unique pinkness of a young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Grace couldn't help but touch her mysterious clit and slowly rubbed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time she touched that mysterious bump, she couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cries from her became more and more tantalizing, and her entire person was wrapped in endless lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this fragrant scene, Marcus gulped, and a certain part of his body swelled up completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A small tent was erected on his already not-so-loose pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace kept scratching Marcus' body and inadvertently grabbed that huge thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but tremble a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to break free, but this was the crucial moment to unclog the energy channels, so he could only let Grace hold it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was perhaps too excited. Her hands were extremely powerful, and if not for Marcus being strong enough there, it was likely to hurt himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uh... oh... ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's other hand rubbed more and more frequently, finally at some point accompanied by another wild shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second orgasm arrived, and she was deflated on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large amount of liquid splashed out, making the bedsheet get wet...</span></p><div class="pagination">
