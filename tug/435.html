  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..." Jane's pussy was completely filled by Marcus' rod in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt complete as Marcus filled her in an instant. The empty feeling from moments before melted away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus thrust in and out swiftly, an intense feeling of relief came over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane gripped Marcus' strong build with both hands and started swaying her hip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a moment, Marcus' Dual Cultivation power automatically bloomed, enveloping both of their bodies completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Jane felt the intense heat sweep over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a sensation that he still hadn't experienced even though he had made love with Marcus many times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense relief almost made Jane pass out on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She desperately cried out in waves, moving her hips intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, oh my goodness. This is so good. Why is it so good? Really, I'm not flattering, but this is insane. What... What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane couldn't help but ask Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' mouth curled up into a confident smile and said, "Since it's comfortable, just enjoy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that this was due to the power of Dual Cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of Dual Cultivation not only maximized the benefits to both Dual Cultivation partners but also doubled their pleasure. It brought intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's mind went completely blank at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus' relentless thrust, she surrendered herself to the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps on the spur of the moment, Jane pressed Marcus right up against her and rode Marcus' cock. Her ass was pressed firmly on top of Marcus' cock, bobbing up and down constantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' cock was completely wrapped around her soft pussy and sucked tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, I love you so much. Oh my gosh, this is so good. Fuck me, Daddy. Fuck me! This is so much better than before. Gosh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane twisted her hips desperately, her cunt clenching uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's soft breasts were slapping against Marcus' face, and Marcus couldn't take it anymore. He rolled over and pinned Jane down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Marcus started trusting in and out, non-stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The BMW car shook for a while. Cries and moans were intertwined inside the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their passionate lovemaking lasted an hour and a half before it was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus' furious thrusts, Jane simply passed out, her body lying on the passenger side, trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her pussy was so wet that it stained the seat, giving off a unique fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You slut, is that enough for you?" Marcus asked, turning to Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane nodded weakly. It was the most intense orgasm she had ever experienced in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even now, she was still enveloped in the afterglow of that profound bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After they finished, Marcus didn't rush to drive away. Instead, he lit a cigarette and took some time to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane soon recovered and opened up to Marcus about her family situation. She had lost her mother when she was very young. Her father had raised her on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, her father remarried. Her stepmother gave birth to a younger brother and sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After having her own children, Jane's stepmother frequently abused her while her father turned a blind eye, sometimes even joining in the abuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Growing up, Jane became withdrawn and insecure. By her teenage years, she began to rebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She even tried dropping out of school to find work, desperate to escape this loveless home devoid of any familial warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Jane couldn't escape her father and stepmother's clutches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was forced to marry a man almost thirty years her senior, who would become Abigail's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane was only sixteen at the time, still in the bloom of youth, when she became a sacrifice for her family's interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As expected, the Winchester family paid her father and stepmother a substantial sum for the marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was their true intention all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, Jane was nothing but a burden, a deadweight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once she was grown, they planned to sell her off to improve their own lives and support their other two children - the ones they had together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the real reason Jane hadn't returned home for so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At home, she never felt any warmth or love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She only reconnected with her family after her stepmother passed away from illness and her father grew too old to care for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite everything, as a daughter, Jane couldn't bear to see her father suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, for the past few years, Jane had been sending substantial amounts of money back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until the Winchester family went bankrupt this year that the money finally stopped coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Jane recalled these memories from long ago, tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To the outside world, she appeared as a vibrant, alluring woman and carried herself as an elegant, sophisticated lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But beneath that facade lay an untold past and a dark childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, opening up to Marcus about everything had lifted a weight from her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Darling, you won't think less of me, will you?" Jane asked Marcus as she wiped away her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never shared these things with anyone before, not even her stepdaughters, Abigail and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were things she had never shared with anyone, not even her stepdaughters Abigail and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could you think that of me?" Marcus said, patting Jane's shoulder reassuringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm going back for my father's 70th birthday, but after that, who knows when I'll see him again," Jane sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood ties were blood ties, after all. No matter what happened, family would always be family.</span></p><div class="pagination">
