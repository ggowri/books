  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were talking, several people had come to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recognized Baron next to Blake at a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baron smiled and nodded to Marcus, then continued to say to Blake, "Even my master has to respect Mr. Fitzgerald. His strength is beyond our imagination. I don't want the Axe Gang to have a conflict with Mr. Fitzgerald. If there is any misunderstanding, just solve it together. Mr. Brooks, if you feel that this is not acceptable, then vent your anger on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Baron knew that Marcus was very powerful, he only learned about Marcus' power through his master's description and had never witnessed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he was already loyal to dissuade Blake when Blake was determined to deal with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this sentence failed to calm the anger of Blake but provoked him. "Baron, do you mean I need to be respectful to this person like your master does?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a man who has been in the underground world for more than 20 years. How can you still be so timid? I overestimated you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Blake wanted to talk to Marcus, but Baron stopped him again. "You must not do that. Listen to me, Mr. Fitzgerald is indeed very strong. As the saying </span><span>goes, when two tigers fight, one will be injured. Since we are all gangsters, why don't we sit down and talk calmly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking. If you continue, just get out of the Axe Gang right now. I don't need someone like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake became even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't understand why a young man in his early 20s could be praised so much by Baron!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the other masters cast puzzled looks at Baron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their impression, Baron was decisive in his actions, was ruthless in killing, and was a very cruel person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was Baron scared when he met this guy who looked to be in his early 20s?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brooks, what is the relationship between this guy and Baron? Could he be Baron's illegitimate child? Otherwise, why would Baron protect him so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A master joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake looked at Baron and said, "Baron, didn't you say this guy was very powerful? Today I will let you see how your so-called powerful person is trampled under my feet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, Blake looked at Marcus and said, "You are so brave to beat up my nephew. However, have you considered the consequences before coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Blake and said, "Stop talking nonsense. I was the one who beat up your nephew. If you want revenge, just do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, the other members of the Axe Gang became angry, and some even tried to pull out their guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Axe Gang was a well-known gang in this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never been provoked like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake waved his hands at these people, signaling them to put down their guns, and then said to Marcus, "This is the first time I have seen such an arrogant young man like you. I admire your courage. Don't worry, I won't let them shoot. That is not what a man should do. I will beat you by myself and let you know the price of being arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, veins bulged all over Blake's body and he punched Marcus in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of this punch was extremely terrifying. Not only was his physical strength great, but it also contained Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be seen that Blake had been practicing Ancient Martial Art for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that he hadn't found the right method, so he hadn't been able to get started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of this punch was almost enough to compete with a person at Stage One of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he met Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Marcus' eyes, Blake's attack was powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched out casually, not even using one out of ten of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake shook and went backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake looked gloomy and looked at Marcus deeply, saying, "I didn't expect that you are also a warrior. No wonder you dared to force your way into the Axe Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instantly realized that Marcus was not as simple as he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he took another step forward, roared, and used his unique Tiger Fist to smash Marcus' heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch was like a tiger and was extremely powerful. Its power alone was several times stronger than the previous punch. It reached Marcus' body in the blink of an eye!</span></p><div class="pagination">
