Today, we will start by unblocking the one at the breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The other two energy channels will be unblocked one every other day, over a total of three days. After that, you will be able to start learning secret techniques of Ancient Martial Art."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus had already activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, with streams of Numinous Energy surging in his palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he slowly placed his palms on Grace's smooth and firm breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Grace's body froze in place as a surge of electricity coursed through her, causing her to involuntarily let out a gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, it is so embarrassing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment she was touched by Marcus, she unexpectedly shed a single tear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was a very traditional girl, and until now, she had always thought that her first time should be given to her future husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, now, although Marcus was clearing her energy channel, not only was her body exposed, but he had also touched her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Grace feeling deeply conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the complexity in her heart was replaced by a powerful surge of heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That surge of heat quickly traveled from Marcus' palm to the surface of Grace's breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace felt an intense itch on her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful surge of electricity erupted from her breasts, quickly spreading throughout her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body could not help but tremble, and before long, the itching sensation was replaced by an overwhelming sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time she experienced such a strange sensation. She could not help but close her eyes, letting out a soft, faint moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heat intensified, the feeling of comfort for Grace grew even stronger, adding a sense of urgency she had not felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found herself unexpectedly craving something, her mind filling with indescribable images.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Certain parts of the body began to twitch involuntarily, as if a sense of emptiness was spreading, quickly enveloping the entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her breathe harder, her small hands gripping Marcus' arm, her body moving uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah...Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you doing to me? I feel so uncomfortable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace could not help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This impulse was something she had never felt before, and images of being with Marcus in an intimate embrace unexpectedly flashed through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am clearing your energy channel. The process might be slow, so just bear with it for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus fully activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Seeing Grace's enticing expression, a heat stirred within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew he could not take advantage of her vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed aside his distractions and focused entirely on clearing her energy channel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since the vein was connected to a sensitive area of a woman's body, the flow of Numinous Energy inevitably triggered a certain impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Grace, an innocent young woman, it was truly a test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald...I feel so uncomfortable...I want you to help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace completely lost control and threw herself into Marcus' arms, her lips pressing against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Marcus almost lost control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he forced himself to push Grace away. He thought, "This is a crucial moment for clearing her energy channel, and any interruption will undo all my efforts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no choice but fully channel the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. A stronger surge of Timeless Numinous Energy flowed from his palm into Grace's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace felt an overwhelming wave of pleasure, causing her to lose consciousness for a moment, her mind going blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong sensation in her body made her unable to control a high-pitched cry, her body almost giving way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you have made me feel so good, I really want you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace gave a seductive cry uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reached the peak of her experience for the first time, Marcus finally broke through the blocked energy channel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus withdrew his hands from her breasts, letting out a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus withdrew his hands, the intense feeling of pleasure within Grace also faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could not help but feel a strange sense of loss in her heart. "Mr. Fitzgerald...is the treatment over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, "How do you feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face turned crimson as she quickly grabbed a towel from nearby, covering her alluring figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel great...but it is so embarrassing...and...I think I said a lot of shameful things earlier...Mr. Fitzgerald, will you laugh at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace lowered her head, glancing at Marcus' expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "How could I? Your energy channel is in a sensitive area, so it is normal to have such a reaction. After all, we are human, with emotions and desires."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace nodded obediently and asked, "The next session is the day after tomorrow, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I have an arrest operation tomorrow, but I should be able to do the treatment the day after."</span></p><div class="pagination">
