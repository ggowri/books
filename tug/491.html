  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penny said, "Yes, you should introduce yourself so we can help Shannon make a more informed decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly before replying in an even tone. "I don't have a job. I only graduated from middle school. My parents are farmers. If those are your deciding factors, then I suppose I don't meet your standards to be Shannon's boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no trace of defensiveness in his words, only honesty. But the reaction was immediate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny narrowed their eyes, their expressions quickly shifting to mockery. Kyle sneered, "No job, a middle school education, and parents who are farmers? I'm genuinely curious. How did someone like you even come into contact with Shannon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jeremy couldn't suppress a chuckle, a smug satisfaction spreading across his face. His confidence soared. After all, he was a foreign-educated PhD, the son of senior engineers, with a solid and well-off family background. Even in Kingston, his credentials were considered top-tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Jeremy, the gap between himself and Marcus wasn't just wide. It was astronomical. He felt confident he could easily take Marcus' place as Shannon's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle's tone turned stern, almost commanding. "Shannon, do your parents know you're seeing someone like this? As your uncle, I'm telling you right now, you must end things with him immediately! He has no job, education, or background. How is he supposed to provide you with a good life? You're being completely irresponsible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penny nodded, her tone sharp. "Kyle is absolutely right. Relationships are about finding someone compatible, someone on the same level. Given his situation, he's really not worth your time. If your parents find out, they'll be furious. This could truly break their hearts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon's face darkened. She hadn't realized Marcus came from such a humble background. However, she knew his extraordinary abilities more than made up for his lack of status. But what truly irked her was Kyle and Penny's obsession with wealth and status. She wondered, "Does everything have to be about money? Is there no room for real feelings anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Shannon couldn't tell them her thoughts. Instead, she said, "Uncle Kyle, Aunt Penny, I understand you're looking out for me, but I've chosen Marcus, and his background doesn't matter. I'd appreciate it if you stayed out of my personal life. No one can stop me from being with Marcus. And please, don't ever try to introduce me to anyone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon deliberately made her stance unmistakably strong. She knew if she showed even a hint of hesitation, Kyle and Penny would keep scheming to set her up with someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't understand. He has no education, career, or background. How on earth does someone like him make you so devoted?" At this moment, Jeremy, who had been silent until now, stood up. His sharp gaze landed on Marcus as he sneered, "You there. What tricks did you pull to make Shannon fall head over heels for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained silent, his calm demeanor unshaken by the provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's a thought," Jeremy said, his tone dripping with mockery. "If you agree to leave Shannon, I'll pay you. A hefty sum. Enough to completely change your life. Your aging parents won't have to toil in the fields ever again. What do you say?" His words were delivered with such ease that it was as if offering money to solve the problem was the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeremy, that's insulting," Shannon said, unable to stay silent. "Marcus may have a humble background, but he doesn't need your money. He beat Crankhurst's karate 9th-dan black belt champion. Do you really think someone like him would be short on money?" If she had known things would escalate like this, she would never have brought Marcus along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy sneered, "Shannon, this isn't something you can decide for him. Why don't you let him name his price and see?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon was speechless. She glanced at Marcus with uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his hand and waved five fingers in front of Jeremy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy smiled smugly, "Now we're talking! Just name your number. I can make that happen. Is it 500 thousand dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon didn't expect that Marcus was actually going to ask for money. Her chest tightened with disappointment. She wondered if she had thought too highly of him all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Marcus shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy narrowed his eyes slightly. "So it's five million dollars, then?" To him, five million was within reach. After all, his annual salary at Golden Group's pharmaceutical industrial park was five million dollars. If paying that sum meant securing Shannon without relying on his parents, it was an investment he could rationalize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus shook his head again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Jeremy's temper flared. His tone sharpened as he snapped, "Fifty million dollars? Young man, you're biting off more than you can chew!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
