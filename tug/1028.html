  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's parasites like you that have turned Uswad's entertainment industry into this cesspool of corruption! If you think I'm going to just hand over my award, you're delusional! And not only that, I'm going to expose Miles Donovan for rigging award shows for years. Let the world see his disgusting, underhanded schemes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason Chloe had never broken into the absolute top tier of stardom wasn't because she lacked talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had everything&mdash;looks, stage presence, vocal ability. On top of that, she was an incredible actress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her music was high quality, her film and TV roles deeply impactful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, she had remained stuck on the cusp of superstardom. The reason? She refused to play by the industry's dirty rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never entertained any backroom deals. Never gave in to the so-called "unspoken rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of that, she had been gradually pushed to the margins of the industry. Even now, despite producing a smash hit, she was being denied what she rightfully deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injustice made her blood boil. If they wanted war, she was ready to burn it all down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fucking whore," the tall man growled, his face twisting with rage. "You actually think you can go against Mr. Donovan? You must have a death wish! Alright then, boys, looks like this bitch won't be making it to the awards tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a meaningful glance at the other men beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, they stepped forward, reaching for Chloe, trying to drag her toward a nearby black van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would happen next needed no explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a Uswad problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire global entertainment industry had its fair share of corruption&mdash;starlets exploited, careers destroyed behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many young actresses, once full of dreams, had ended up taking their own lives under the weight of such abuse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many had endured what Chloe was facing right now&mdash;cornered, overpowered, left with nowhere to run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice, cold as steel, rang out through the parking lot. All heads turned toward the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall, imposing man in a sharp black suit strode toward them, each step measured, the heels of his shoes tapping crisply against the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's breath caught in her throat as she recognized him. Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had met him once before&mdash;when Zachary had tried to force her into bed. That night, Marcus had stepped in and saved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinarily, rejecting someone like Zachary would have meant the end of her career. At best, she would have been blacklisted. At worst, she would have been destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the very next day, news broke that Zachary had been found dead. She had escaped unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since, she had been wondering&mdash;who had taken out Zachary?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, once again, just as she was about to be swallowed by darkness, Marcus had appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze met hers, steady and reassuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?" the tall man snarled, taking a step forward. "Do you have any idea who you're messing with? We work for Mr. Donovan! You got a death wish, buddy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was trying to intimidate Marcus by dropping Miles' name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just swung. His fist smashed into the man's face with brutal force. There was a sickening crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two front teeth flew from the man's mouth as he crumpled to the ground, groaning in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You son of a bitch!" he screamed, clutching his face, blood dripping between his fingers. "You think you can get away with this? Kill this bastard! Break his fucking legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't just some random thug&mdash;he was Miles' right-hand man. No one had ever dared to disrespect him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And no one had ever dared to hit him first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this bastard? This bastard was going to pay.</span></p><div class="pagination">
