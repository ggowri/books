As a result, blood gushed out of his mouth nonstop, and he wailed in pain on the floor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, another attack came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus seized him by the wrist and twisted it hard. With a click sound, his wrist was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he took a quick step forward and landed directly in front of the other two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could react, he kicked them in the knee and made two muffled thuds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their knees were smashed into pieces. They let out heart-rending screams, crumpled down in front of Marcus, and howled in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone from the Apis Boxing Club had quietly made his way behind Marcus at some point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was delivering a punch to the back of Marcus' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only 6.3 feet tall, and his Fist Ray was not something that ordinary people could withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Striking the back of the head was strictly prohibited in the fighting arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack was very dangerous and might cause casualties accidentally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a quick reaction Marcus had!&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately sensed the attack coming from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw a backhand punch, his Fist Ray as fast as lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the man's attack came, his fist had already landed on the man's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a crash of bones breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's chest caved in, and numerous of his ribs were fractured. He was sent hurtling backward, and it was unknown whether he was still breathing or had already perished after falling to the floor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Marcus unleashed another punch, hitting a man from the Apis Boxing Club on the left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a piercing shriek. The bones in his upper arm were shattered to pieces, and he crumpled to the floor, howling in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next two minutes, Marcus was like a tiger among a flock of sheep. Even though there were numerous members of the Apis Boxing Club, they were completely unable to gain the upper hand against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they attacked him together, one of them would be knocked to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Marcus single-handedly overpowered every member of the Apis Boxing Club except Moreno!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people couldn't help but gasp at the sight of this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never expected that the seemingly ordinary young man would have such astonishing strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, a minimum of 50 individuals from the Apis Boxing Club had just taken part in the encirclement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had undergone professional combat training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fighting strength was simply far beyond the reach of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even so, they still seemed weak when faced with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, they were knocked to the floor by him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His formidable strength stunned everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed that even the top-notch fighters in the world could not pull off such a remarkable accomplishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia and the members of the Iron Fist Club were all thrilled, feeling that their long-suppressed anger had finally dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus fixed his eyes on Moreno, who was already dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Now, it's your turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, he was already walking towards Moreno step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his arrogance, Moreno did not dare to assert that he possessed such terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confronted with the might of absolute strength, he was no longer arrogant but terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a ring. We are just competing in martial arts. You'd better not act recklessly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno issued a warning to Marcus, as if he had forgotten his earlier statement that he was in favor of Marcus' idea of a fight with no rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually attempted to restrain Marcus with the rules of the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "It's a fight without rules. You have agreed to this beforehand. So why are you lecturing me about the rules of a ring fight now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he had already approached Moreno and reached out his big hand towards Moreno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so cocky. I will kill you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Dutton, below the ring, finally couldn't bear it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaping into the ring, he blocked Moreno behind him and tried to punch Marcus fiercely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows slightly and instantly detected a faint trace of the warrior's aura emanating from Dutton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, he had attained the Ancient Martial Stage One in his cultivation. As a result, those who merely engaged in regular combat training would never stand a chance against him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned sideways to dodge his attack instead of fighting back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but whisper, "Since you are a warrior, which sect are you from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dutton snorted, "To be honest, I once practiced in the Celestial Arc Order. If you are scared, beg for mercy right now. I'll let you live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, not giving Dutton another moment's respite. With a large hand, he grabbed Dutton's throat and hoisted him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dutton's expression instantly turned ghastly. He struggled desperately but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me, or the Celestial Arc Order will take revenge on you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
