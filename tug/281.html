  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? This guy is actually connected to the chairman of Golden Group? And Golden Group has announced they're rejoining the bidding process. It is not good news for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Golden Group is a diversified company, but it also has top-tier construction firms under its umbrella. With their participation, we've got another formidable competitor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It doesn't matter. With a top-tier company like Rivera Construction Group in the bidding, small companies like ours basically have no hope. We're just here for the show. What surprises me is that this guy is connected to Golden Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people were buzzing with conversation, and their looks towards Marcus had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Melina gave Marcus a meaningful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I said I could regain our bidding qualifications. What do you have to say now?" Marcus sat at the main seat and spoke indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ethan was both angry and embarrassed, and he laughed sarcastically. "So what if you've regained your participation? You're just a puppet of Golden Group. Does their success or failure in the bid have anything to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words once again earned agreement from those present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all thought Marcus was just on good terms with Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had called Michelle for help, and she had reluctantly assisted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That meant Marcus and Melina were just spectators here, with no stake in anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said nonchalantly, "Once Golden Group wins the bid, they will transfer the project to the Flourish Group for construction. It's as simple as that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people couldn't help but laugh out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the funniest joke they had heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed he really thought he could control Golden Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus spoke earnestly, while others just thought he was a good actor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Melina, beside Marcus, couldn't believe his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bayside Amusement Park was a big prize. No company would transfer such a prize to someone else after winning the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was completely illogical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could Marcus really pull it off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The organizers of the bidding process were pleased with Golden Group's re-entry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the more intense the competition, the more likely they were to find a higher-quality contractor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle was very efficient. In less than ten minutes, she had sent over Golden Group's bid documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bidding process was set to announce results on the spot after the bids were submitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All companies participating in the bidding had to submit their bid documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The organizers would review these documents, assess the overall strength and operational status of the bidding companies, and determine the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's submit the documents," Emma said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Golden Group's announcement of rejoining the bid had not affected her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, all the bidding companies had submitted their documents, awaiting preliminary review.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The review took about half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone waited nervously for the results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the preliminary review, only ten out of hundreds of bidding companies remained, with a 90% elimination rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Golden Group and Rivera Construction Group advanced without a doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hours passed, and the bidding process reached a fever pitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition to the bid documents, each company had to send representatives to talk with the reviewers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reviewers judged the sincerity of the bidders and their specific implementation plans through conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through several rounds of selection, it soon came down to the final contenders for the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Golden Group and Rivera Construction Group, as expected, became the last contenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it seemed that Golden Group, as a local company, had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The amusement park investors also favored Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, local big companies had inherent advantages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the first round of scoring, Golden Group received a score of eight out of ten, while Rivera Construction Group only got two points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed like the outcome was a foregone conclusion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ethan whispered to Emma, "Ms. Rivera, according to previous information, Golden Group didn't plan to participate in the bidding. We didn't expect them to be so well-prepared after deciding to join. From the current situation, it seems we don't have much of a chance. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma remained confident. "Don't panic. I'm determined to win this bid. The contractor for the amusement park will only be Rivera Construction Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Emma made a phone call.</span></p><div class="pagination">
