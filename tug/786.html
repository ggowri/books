Any issues?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was... mostly smooth," Marcus replied, his tone nonchalant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for some reason, to Liam's trained eyes, there was something subtly different about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to before his descent into the underwater world, Marcus seemed even stronger now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus didn't exert any aura or presence, just standing there, casually at ease, </span><span>he </span><span>radiated a power that made Liam's chest tighten, an inexplicable unease washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized the feeling&mdash;a primal fear deep in his soul, something only a person would feel when standing before someone far, far stronger than themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Sky, it's good to see you and all our fellow martial artists in good health!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a voice rang out from the distance, carrying through the air like a </span><span>sharp whistle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many turned their gazes toward the source of the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man, appearing to be in his early thirties, floated effortlessly in midair, gliding toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He descended swiftly, landing with ease near Marcus, Liam, and Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before he spoke or made any move, the mere presence of this man radiated an undeniable pressure, a subtle force that weighed heavily on those nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's reaction was immediate. Surprise flickered across many faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One person murmured, "Travis... Travis is here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I heard he was locked away in seclusion, trying to break into Ancient Martial Stage Nine. I didn't think he'd make it in time for this exploration of the Ice Wall's space-time gate, but here he is, right at the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at him... His aura. It seems he's already reached Stage Nine. That means his retreat was a complete success."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once he hits Stage Nine, Travis will be among the top experts in the world of Ancient Martial Art of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's unstoppable. Despite being a lone wanderer with no sect or master, ever since Travis arrived in the world of Ancient Martial Art, he's been on a meteoric rise. At just 35 years old, he's already made it to Stage Nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's got serious potential&mdash;he could very well step into the Return Essence stage before long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Travis Sullivan landed, the crowd buzzed with excitement and speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis was a unique figure in the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a sect or a faction to back him, he was a rogue cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his innate talent was so extraordinary that his progress seemed almost unnatural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd surpassed the top disciples of most major sects, leaving them in his dust, his rise a testament to raw, untapped potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world of Ancient Martial Art, the only person to have broken through to Ancient Martial Stage Nine before Travis was Alonzo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo was an ancient being who had lived through several cycles of samsara, making his breakthrough more a product of time than sheer talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over decades, even centuries, he had chipped away at the barriers of cultivation, and finally, at long last, reached that elusive and coveted state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Travis was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't lived through multiple lifetimes. Yet, just like Alonzo, he had managed to reach Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comparison between their abilities spoke volumes about their respective innate talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis' potential, given enough time, was boundless.</span></p><div class="pagination">
