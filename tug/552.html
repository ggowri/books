  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They got into the BMW 3 Series.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took his place in the driver's seat and asked Lila, "Where do you live? I'll drive </span><span>you</span><span> home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Urban Apartments."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila answered softly, stealing glances at Marcus' chiseled profile. She felt a strange flutter in her chest as if she still held onto specific hopes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus started the car and drove the BMW 3 Series to Urban Apartments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that the complex definitely showed its age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the looks of it, the buildings had to be at least twenty years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After asking, Marcus learned that Lila was renting her place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't bought a property in Kingston yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That made sense, really.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kingston was a pricey place to live, every square inch costing a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's fame had skyrocketed, sure, but it was a recent phenomenon. In reality, she hadn't raked in that much dough yet, certainly not enough to buy a place in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They climbed the stairs together. The stairwell was old and narrow, crammed with electrical wires and pipes, reeking of </span><span>moldy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila lived on the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they reached her floor, they found a drunk young man slumped in front of Lila's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he saw Lila, he stumbled to his feet, his eyes darting between her and Marcus with barely concealed hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, why haven't you been answering my calls? Where have you been these past few days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's face twisted with disgust. "I was performing. Where else would I be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man shot back, "Why didn't you tell me? Is this how you treat me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto Marcus again. "Oh, I get it now. You weren't performing at all! You were fooling around with this guy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been pursuing you for years, taking care of your every need. When you first came to Kingston, I helped you so much, but you never gave me a chance. Now you're running around with some random guy? How could you do this to me, Lila?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man grew increasingly agitated, his eyes burning with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name was Shawn Wayne, and he came from the same hometown as Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd both moved to Kingston a year ago to chase their dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They met by chance and, being from the same hometown, naturally grew closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would help each other out from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Lila was a young woman alone in the city, Shawn often helped her with various things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lila's stunning beauty had captured Shawn's heart ultimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been pursuing her relentlessly ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Lila was grateful to Shawn, she had no romantic feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Shawn kept pursuing her relentlessly, and seeing his genuine feelings and their shared hometown connection that made the conversation flow easily, Lila started to consider giving him a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the night before she planned to say yes, Shawn couldn't handle being alone and went to see a prostitute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even brought the girl back to his place, where Lila happened to catch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila felt sick to her stomach, and that tiny spark that had started to grow was instantly extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years flew by, and Lila became a top social media influencer with millions of followers, her songs becoming hits across the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Shawn remained unmotivated, working as a delivery driver and drinking </span><span>himself into oblivion almost every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still kept harassing Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, clearly drunk again, he was waiting outside her door to ambush her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who I hang out with and where I go is none of your business, Shawn. How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone? Why won't you listen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've held back from calling the police because we're from the same hometown, but if you keep this up, I won't be so nice anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila said with disgust written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to have a decent impression of Shawn, but ever since that time he went down a destructive path and got caught with a prostitute, any positive feelings she had vanished, replaced by pure revulsion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, I never thought you were such a cheap slut. Acting all pure and innocent with me, when </span><span>really</span><span> you're just trash that anyone can use. What a fool I was ever to like you! I must have been blind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead then, if you've got the guts, call the cops on me! I haven't done anything illegal! They can't touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn sneered, looking at Lila with utter contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought that Lila had rejected him only to be ridden by this man filled him with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Shawn could say another word, Lila's hand cracked across his face in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they first met, she'd thought Shawn was actually a decent person, reasonable, at least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, whatever had happened to him, he'd turned into such a brute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one who'd sunk into depravity first, yet here he was, spewing vicious lies about Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch, how dare you hit me! I'll kill you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
