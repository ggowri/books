He said that none of us are worthy of being his opponent. It's so funny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you should never bother with this kind of person. I guess he doesn't even know what mountain racing is. In his eyes, it is probably just driving a truck to transport goods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people couldn't help laughing, and the laughter became even more sarcastic than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you to be so arrogant. Let me ask you first, have you ever driven a sports car?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John spoke sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina quickly winked at Marcus and said, "Don't bother with these people. They are just crazy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Melina a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he stood up, straightened his clothes slowly, and said, "Under normal circumstances, you are not worthy of being my opponent, including that Mr. Park you mentioned. But to prevent your flies from continuing to harass Melina, I decided to let you see what a modern car god is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, he walked straight out of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John and others were stunned, then followed by a mocking look on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina also followed quickly behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me the car keys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved at Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no choice but to hand the Ferrari keys to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen super sports cars started up simultaneously, and the sound shook the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous conversation attracted the attention of many other guests in the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were several racing enthusiasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To watch the fun, these guests paid their bills and followed out, starting their cars, ready to follow this group of young people to watch the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John designated a mountain racing track, and a fleet of super sports cars drove towards the track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Marcus briefly familiarized himself with the basic operations of this Ferrari 720s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the familiarization process, he seemed a little unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Melina, who was sitting in the passenger seat, even more worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Marcus didn't seem to be very good at driving. How could he compare with those crazy people who played with cars all the time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Marcus had already said it, it was difficult for her to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already started thinking in her mind how to stop those guys from mocking Marcus if he lost the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is Mr. Park? Is he very powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told Marcus about Edison's basic situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no exaggeration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Dakar Rally trophies were proof of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but nod in praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than 20 minutes, the team arrived at the starting point of the mountain running track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a mountainous area on the outskirts of Kingston. The terrain was steep and there were many bends. Racing enthusiasts often hung out here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after the convoy stopped, a Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle drove over from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man in his 40s walked down from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Park is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Edison, a group of young men and women all looked at him with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Park, someone wants to challenge you, you must perform well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John said to Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also briefly told Edison what happened in the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison's eyes fell on Marcus. He simply looked him over and then retracted his gaze, saying, "Then let's run. Hurry up. I have other things to do in the afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, he got directly into the driver's seat of John's Pagani sports car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John sat in the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the young men and women also got on the bus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following a young man's whistle, a group of supercars rushed out of the finish line like swords shot from a bow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' Ferrari 720s was the second to last to start, while Edison deliberately put himself in last place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the familiarization process was too short, Marcus hadn't gasped on this car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a gap was opened between him and other vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, there's no need to fight with them. Let's just drive slowly. Safety comes first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina reminded him, with a hint of comfort in her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, this is just the beginning. Once I get familiar with this car, I will be able to catch up with them soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two minutes later, the Pagani driven by Edison, like a ghost, overtook more than a dozen super sports cars and ranked first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the gap was getting wider and wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was the last one and was gradually being left behind by the main group.</span></p><div class="pagination">
