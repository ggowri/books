  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the words, the Thurman family members all looked visibly ashamed, their expressions filled with remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it this young man who saved me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Bowden noticed Marcus and asked the group, his tone curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt as though he had just awakened from a long dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that dream, it was Marcus who had pulled him back from the brink of death and saved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As such, the moment he woke up, he immediately recognized Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Grandpa. Marcus saved you!" Melina explained eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowden's expression turned emotional, his voice trembling as he said, "Young man, I can't thank you enough. You are like a savior to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and smiled, "It was nothing, Sir Thurman. No need to be so polite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari stepped forward and said, "Dad, Marcus is Melina's boyfriend. He came here today specifically to visit you. When he saw how severe your condition was, he treated you. I didn't expect that he would actually cure your terminal cancer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Kari's words, Bowden broke into a wide smile. He said, "Wonderful! My granddaughter has truly outdone herself by finding such an exceptional young man. He is truly a blessing to our family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his gaze shifted to Davey and Neil. He continued, "Davey, Neil, I'd like to take this opportunity to announce something important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melina will officially become the heir to our family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he said this, Neil and Cloe's expressions fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil and Cloe had spent years scheming to secure the family inheritance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Davey and Melina had always been more favored by Bowden, putting Neil and Cloe at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when Cloe became Landon's girlfriend did Bowden's opinion of her improve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, on his deathbed, he had even suggested making Cloe the family heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, just after regaining consciousness, Bowden had announced that Melina would inherit the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike before, this time, it was official.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This announcement left Cloe with no chance to compete for the position again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, you mentioned before that you were considering me as the family heir. Why have you changed your mind now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I am about to marry into the Whitman family, making me the most suitable candidate for the role!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe couldn't bear it any longer and questioned Bowden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, Dad. Cloe is going to be the future matriarch of the Whitman family. She is undoubtedly the best choice for our family's heir. You can't go back on your word!" Neil chimed in, trying to support his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey and Kari's expressions darkened. They hadn't expected Neil and Cloe to care so much about the position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they cared so little about family bonds and openly argued for the position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, though slightly unsettled, remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was more relaxed about it compared to her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long been aware of her cousin's ambitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Melina didn't care much for the title of heir. This was why she had never exposed Cloe's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! If it weren't for Melina, I'd already be in my grave! No one in this family is more deserving of being the heir than Melina!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Bowden seemed to have made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having faced death, he now saw life in a new light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, wealth, power, and status were insignificant compared to life itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Melina's boyfriend had saved his life, he decided to repay Marcus this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Thurman, you should think carefully about the consequences of your decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, Landon, who had been silent until now, said these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil and Cloe's eyes lit up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew Landon was about to step in, and with his intervention, their hopes were reignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowden gave Landon a thoughtful look. He asked, "Mr. Whitman, if you have something to say, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't name Cloe the heir, I will withdraw all my investments in the Thurman family. I don't think I need to elaborate on what that would mean for your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's words carried an unmistakable threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although directed at the Thurman family, Neil and Cloe felt triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Landon followed through with his threat, the Thurman family's entire business empire would face ruin, potentially collapsing overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil and Cloe were confident Bowden would have no choice but to compromise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, as soon as Landon finished speaking, Bowden's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His previously bright complexion faded as the stress took hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa!" Seeing this, Melina quickly supported him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared coldly at Neil and Cloe and said, "Stop arguing. I don't care about being the heir. I only want Grandpa to stay healthy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Neil and Cloe smirked, their expressions filled with smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will be the heir, no matter what!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Melina finished her words, Marcus' voice cut through the tension.</span></p><div class="pagination">
