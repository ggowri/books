  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell silent at Ada's outrageous statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She claimed that this guy was only at Ancient Martial Stage Six and was more potent than Nathan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could that be possible? It was simply unthinkable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone present, this was absolute nonsense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Nathan had not only reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Seven, but he also possessed an extraordinary ability to challenge opponents above his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before reaching his current power level, he could defeat warriors at Ancient </span><span>Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Marcus possibly stand against someone of that caliber?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could understand why Ada would speak up for Marcus like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's expression froze momentarily before a deeply sarcastic smile spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ada, it's been years since we last met, and I must say, your words have become increasingly absurd. Have I given you a wrong impression? Why would you think I'd overlook this nobody as an opponent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just at Ancient Martial Stage Six! I could finish him with a single move, yet you think he could defeat me? That's ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I get it. You must think you can intimidate me into backing down with this strategy. Let me tell you straight up! It won't work. This fight is inevitable unless he can withstand three of my moves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nathan, everything I'm saying is true. I'm giving you sincere advice, hoping you'll listen. Please don't play with fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada continued to plead earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard enough! Today, I'll test the strength of the one you hold in such high regard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nathan spoke, his aura burst forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The full power of a peak Stage Seven Ancient Martial warrior erupted, making the entire space feel unbearably heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan unleashed a destructive handprint at Marcus in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a renowned Ancient Martial Arts clan, Nathan's reputation was well-earned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always excelled at fighting opponents above his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the start, Marcus could tell that Nathan's true strength surpassed that of an early Stage Eight Ancient Martial warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's attack was unstoppable, carrying a terrifying Binding Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it engulfed the entire space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful Binding Force attempted to freeze Marcus' body, making the air seem to stop flowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those standing nearby struggled to breathe, feeling like they were suffocating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As expected of the Caster family's son! This attack is potent! Even a Stage Eight warrior would struggle against it. That guy's dead meat for offending Nathan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nathan's among the Divine Mount. His full-power strike isn't something nobody can handle. I bet Nathan will finish him in seconds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing the terrifying power of Nathan's attack, the onlookers buzzed with excited discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one believed Marcus could last long against Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most </span><span>were</span><span> certain Nathan would completely crush Marcus within three moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, none realized that Marcus far surpassed Nathan in power and skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack that seemed overwhelming to everyone else moved like a snail and felt as weak as paper to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a casual step, Marcus vanished from his spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It couldn't even catch Marcus' shadow when Nathan's attack landed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already reappeared on the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people present couldn't even see how Marcus dodged such a terrifying attack from Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did this guy dodge it? How'd he </span><span>do</span><span> that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, his speed was insane. I couldn't see how he moved before appearing on the other side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's only at Ancient Martial Stage Six. His speed shouldn't be that fast. I bet he used some special equipment. Otherwise, there's no way he could've dodged Nathan's attack so easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's what I think too. Nathan's attack was potent! Someone at his level should've been one-shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan looked hard at Marcus and said, "Lucky dodge. Try surviving this one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Nathan channeled an even more devastating attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Nathan deliberately increased the attack's range to prevent Marcus from dodging easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the entire space was filled with destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present trembled, never expecting Nathan's attack to be this overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus' movements proved even swifter than anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Nathan's attack could land, Marcus again pulled off his signature vanishing act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could process what happened, Marcus had disappeared entirely from his spot, as if he'd never been there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This turn of events made Nathan's expression darken considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Missing two attacks in a row was a significant blow to his ego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled his energy into an even more devastating attack, determined to put Marcus in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Marcus dodged with even more incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack had barely begun when Marcus materialized behind Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The consequences would have been devastating if Marcus had chosen to strike at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three attacks have passed. According to our agreement, you've lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice came from behind Nathan, making his face turn ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Burning with humiliation, Nathan suddenly changed his tune, roaring at Marcus, "Who says I've lost? I won't stop until we settle this once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Nathan completely lost his mind, attempting a surprise death blow at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This strike seemed even more terrifying than before, coming from a deadly angle. Nathan was aimed at taking Marcus' life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You despicable!" Ada exclaimed, her delicate brows furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe Nathan would go back on his word like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed to warn Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' reflexes were lightning-fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Nathan's attack could land, Marcus had already spun around and launched a devastating counter-punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next instant, everyone heard the thunderous boom of the impact echoing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The destructive force rippled outward in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan felt an overwhelming power slam into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body violently shook as he stumbled backward, his chest churning with internal damage. Blood rushed to his throat, which he forcefully swallowed back down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this scene, everyone present was struck with shock and disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
