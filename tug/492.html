  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus gestured with his hand, Kyle and Penny's faces darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle said coldly, "Young man, don't push your luck. Jeremy's already offering five million dollars for you to leave Shannon. That's more than generous. Yet you're demanding 50 million dollars? Talk about biting off more than you can chew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Kyle finished speaking, Marcus said, "You've got it all wrong. I meant 50 billion dollars! Without that, don't even dream of making me leave Shannon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hung like a thunderclap, leaving Kyle, Penny, and Jeremy utterly stunned. They stared at Marcus as if he were a lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy couldn't hold back and burst into mocking laughter. "You must be out of your damn mind! Do you even know how much 50 billion dollars is? With your parents' farming income, they wouldn't make that in a hundred lifetimes! And yet here you are, demanding 50 billion dollars like it's nothing. What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy then turned to Shannon, his sneer growing wider. "Shannon, this is the man you chose? He's clearly got a screw loose. Whether you agree to date me or not, you should at least thank me. I've just helped you see what kind of nutcase you've been hanging out with!" His laughter echoed through the room, smug and unrestrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penny said, "Jeremy's right. This young man clearly isn't playing with a full deck. Asking for 50 billion dollars? Even if we pooled together every penny from everyone in this room, we wouldn't come close to that figure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon flushed with embarrassment. She never imagined Marcus would say something so far-fetched. Fifty billion dollars was no small number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't fazed. He sneered, "The fact that you can't muster 50 billion dollars just proves your own lack of ability. Complaining about it won't change anything. Don't you think that's a little pathetic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words shifted the mood in the room, and Kyle, Penny, and Jeremy's expressions grew more strained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy retorted sarcastically, "And I suppose you can just pull 50 billion dollars out of thin air? Let's get real. You're uneducated, unqualified, and have no connections. Honestly, I doubt you even understand what 50 billion dollars looks like. Yet here you are, bragging like a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus locked eyes with Jeremy and said, "What if I do have 50 billion dollars? What will you do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy smirked, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "Simple. If you can produce 50 billion dollars, I'll kiss your boots in front of everyone here. But if you can't, you pack up and leave Shannon for good. Deal?" He leaned back, letting out a mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy was confident he had Marcus cornered. The mere thought of someone like Marcus winning Shannon's favor filled him with rage. He was itching to put Marcus in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny exchanged knowing smirks, their expressions brimming with mockery. They were more than ready to enjoy the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal," Marcus replied nonchalantly. Then, he pulled out his phone and opened a payment app, showing its balance to Jeremy, Kyle, and Penny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The balance displayed wasn't even part of Marcus' main wealth. It was just his personal spending account. Yet it showed an eye-popping figure of over 60 billion dollars. His other assets were stored as cash in his Spatial Ring. Through a combination of profits from his companies and gains from defeating his enemies, Marcus' liquid assets totaled well over two trillion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus revealed everything he had, the people in the room might faint from shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six... sixty-five point three billion dollars? How is that possible?" Jeremy's jaw dropped as his eyes fixed on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny leaned in for a closer look and were both shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious about the commotion, Shannon took Marcus' phone and glanced at the screen. The moment her eyes landed on the figure, her entire body trembled. She screamed inwardly, "Sixty-five point three billion dollars! Marcus actually has over 65.3 billion in a payment app. No wonder he's so calm about Jeremy's challenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What stunned Shannon even more was that this was merely the balance in an app. A place where most people wouldn't store large sums unless they had more money than they knew what to do with. This could only mean Marcus likely had even more wealth in other accounts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization shattered everything Shannon, Kyle, Penny, and Jeremy thought they knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you get a good look?" Marcus asked, his gaze fixed on Jeremy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's face turned pale. He couldn't wrap his head around it. How could Marcus, who claimed to have no education, connections, or job, possibly have that much money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible! There's no way this is real. The app on your phone must be fake," Jeremy sputtered. Suddenly, an idea struck him, and his eyes lit up. "I've got it! There's this trending virtual stock trading app where everyone's account balance is calculated in trillions. That must be the app you're using!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny exchanged skeptical glances, their curiosity piqued. "Wait, there's really an app like that?" Penny asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course there is," Jeremy replied confidently. He pulled out his own phone and quickly navigated to the app store. Typing in "virtual stock trading," he found the app in question almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy downloaded the app and began tinkering with it. After just a few taps, his balance jumped from a few dollars to over ten billion.</span></p><div class="pagination">
