  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't quite wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Godfather, the most powerful man in the world, a figure whose wealth rivaled that of nations</span><span style="font-style: italic;">...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">H</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ow could </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I </span><span style="font-style: italic;">be the son of </span><span style="font-style: italic;">him</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way... </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This better not be some kind of sick joke... Is this a freaking scam?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had grown up alone in an orphanage, so, the revelation felt surreal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the stunning blonde girl stood up, her hand weaving through the air, and a shimmering screen flickered to life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On it appeared an elderly man, his hair </span><span>gray</span><span> and his demeanor frail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, Mr. Fitzgerald has been located!" the girl announced respectfully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man nodded approvingly. "Well done, Diana. You'll be his </span><span>assistant</span><span> from now on," he instructed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana Harrison bowed deeply, her voice steady. "Yes, Godfather!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan Gellar, the Godfather, fixed Marcus with kind eyes. "Son, don't doubt yourself. Trust me, you're my flesh and blood. I'm sorry you've suffered alone all these years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about the old man's familiar face on the screen struck a chord, Marcus finally called out, "Dad..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of the word, relief flooded the Godfather's features.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm running out of time. Your brothers are like wolves, fighting over my empire and even hurting each other. They're too ruthless and greedy, not fit to lead."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're different. Good boy, I want you to take my place. But with your brothers' influence and you showing up out of nowhere, people will talk."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to prove yourself first, to silence the naysayers."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm giving you the Golden Group."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ryan spoke, a fit of violent coughing wracked his frail body, making him appear even weaker.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Golden Group... that's a company worth hundreds of billions of dollars!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And Felix, that smug bastard, is deputy GM there, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's gunning for the GM position tomorrow, with that bitch Abigail dreaming of being his trophy wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Heh, things are getting really interesting. They wouldn't know I'm already the chairman of the Golden Group!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can't wait to see how miserable those two shameless will be when they find out who their new boss is!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk played across Marcus' lips as he imagined their faces at tomorrow's meeting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well?" Ryan wheezed, still smiling. "How's that? Think you can handle it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't want to disappoint him, he squared his shoulders and nodded firmly. "Count on it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! That's my son!" Ryan beamed. "But watch your back. Golden Group's a snake pit of office politics. Your brothers want it bad, so managing this company won't be easy.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You're on your own now. Get prepared, I can't help you during this time. Show them what you're made of!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen went dark, and those black-clad men vanished with their Galewings, leaving Marcus alone with Diana on the roadside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he finally had a chance to look at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked to be in her early twenties, yet her figure was strikingly mature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was pure cream, topped with golden hair and eyes so blue one could drown in them. Those perfect breasts and mile-long slender legs under that tight leather skirt were pure sins, driving every man crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about her screamed mixed heritage - that impossible combo of innocent and smoking hot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a breeze carried her perfume his way, making his heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt a stirring within him, an erection he couldn't quite control.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you staring at?" Diana blushed under his stare, "you'll get bored looking if I'm going to be your assistant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Assistant, huh? Is it a full-service deal? I mean, if I want you right now, you wouldn't say no?" His eyes lingered on her alluring cleavage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since that pendant thing, his libido had been in overdrive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Technically, I can't refuse. I would follow all your orders without question," she smirked, flipping her hair. "But that's duty, not desire. If you want me, you better earn it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an Alphard luxury van pulled up, and Diana held the door. "Mr. Fitzgerald, please get in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she handed him a document. "Mr. Fitzgerald, this is the stock transfer agreement for Golden Group. Sign here, and you'll be the chairman."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus signed the contract, and the van sped down Bayside Avenue, quickly arriving at Bayside Villa&mdash;his new residence arranged by Ryan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus sank into the plush sofa, the pendant around his neck suddenly glowed with a bright light, and a flood of memories rushed into his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Timeless Warrior's Grimoire!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he had stumbled upon an Ancient Martial Art cultivation technique, consisting of nine states, with each stage enhancing one's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each breakthrough would also grant a unique ability.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So that's how I survived the ocean...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm already a warrior now!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued, absorbing the significance of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Uswad, warriors were enigmatic beings with immense power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Legends spoke of some who could reshape the very earth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus never imagined he would one day be among their ranks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was just a rookie. To master this power, he needed an amulet that complemented the pendant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that amulet was sitting on the nightstand in the Winchester Villa, he had to retrieve it to unlock his full potential.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Time to go get it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
