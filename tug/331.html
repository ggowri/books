Sir, where did you get them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was surprised and asked Marcus. She didn't expect him to get so many guns at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't rob someone, right? Of course, I bought them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much did these cost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"100 billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana breathed a sigh of relief, still astonished. "Mr. Fitzgerald is wealthy now. He spent 100 billion dollars on guns! Few can afford it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitman family in Kingston, like the Burnett family, ranked among the four major families in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a profound family with fabulous wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitmans occupied a pivotal position in business, political, and military circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the eldest son of the Whitman family, Shaun had always been regarded as the heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Shaun failed to propose to Maxine at Matthew's 80th birthday party, he had been depressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his hatred for Marcus didn't abate, keeping plotting how to make Marcus pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, in the luxurious room where Shaun was located, there was a strange power rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a light curtain came out of thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man wearing a black cloak and a hat appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun couldn't see his face clearly, but his deep and empty crimson pupils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" Shaun asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar gave you and Malcolm a task, yet you two failed to complete it, which even combined the Burnetts and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar is angry when he gets the news. You must kill Marcus within one month. Otherwise, you will be punished most cruelly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving this passage, the light curtain disappeared utterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun looked pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Roger was very dissatisfied with his recent performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't kill Marcus within a month, not only would he be punished, but the whole Whitman family might be implicated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Shaun's door was pushed open, and a middle-aged man came in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hudson, you have finally arrived. I have been waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the middle-aged man, Shaun grasped the hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar has ordered me to come to kill Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This middle-aged man was Aiton Hudson, the head of the Hudson family in Eldoria!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete Hudson, who was killed by Marcus before, was his son!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great. With our power, Marcus is doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun said so with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Roger would not count on him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiton was not only the head of the Hudsons but also a semi-robot transformation engineer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the field of semi-robots, Aiton occupied a vital position all over the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The semi-robot he transformed had reached the third version, and its strength was not inferior to that of warriors, Wizards, and metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. This time, I brought the newly developed semi-robot of the fourth version. No matter how powerful Marcus is, he will die in the hands of my semi-robots!" Aiton said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of his son's tragic death at the hands of Marcus filled his heart with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When are you going to leave, Mr. Hudson? I want to go with you and see how Marcus dies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun said so excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took his woman, and he had to chop him into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd be ecstatic if he could witness Marcus being torn apart by Aiton's semi-robots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can go tomorrow!" Aiton said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two agreed on the departure time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A storm was about to sweep across Solomia again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know any of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After unloading the guns, he went back to his room, ready to take a bath and have a good rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl had prepared foot-washing water for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through this period of adaptation, Pearl was wholly accustomed to the urbanized life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane often bought some cosmetics and skin care products for Pearl, which made Pearl's bronzed skin become smoother and tender, revealing rosiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, let me help you take a bath," Pearl said gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a mini dress and stooped to test the water, her cleavage exposed to Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
