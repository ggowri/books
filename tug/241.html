In a panic, they attempted to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't about to let them go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he swung the blade again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying blade aura enveloped the space in front of the two Wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hurriedly released their most powerful magical attacks in an attempt to block, but it was pointless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden blade aura was too strong; it tore through everything in its path, instantly cutting both Wizards down where they stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the assassination team&mdash;comprised of an Ancient Martial Art Stage Four expert and two Stage Three Wizards&mdash;was completely wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate, quickly collecting their Spatial Rings and using his Fire Attribute Power to incinerate their bodies before stepping away from the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the incident with the Burnett family, his previously unseen second brother had become aware of his growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they had sent an Ancient Martial Art Stage Four expert after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't anticipated this and broken through to the same level of power beforehand, he might have been in serious danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed clear he needed to continue advancing his strength quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing these three would only infuriate his second brother even more, and stronger individuals would likely be sent to deal with him next. The pressure weighed heavily on Marcus, but he wasn't too concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When danger comes, one must face it; when problems arise, one must solve them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It only took him about ten minutes to return to the business car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing Marcus return unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who did you kill?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar's people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's eyes flickered in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Marcus to be so composed, even in the face of Roger Gellar's men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he killed them, but he also seemed utterly indifferent about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ryan Gellar was the most powerful man in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His son, Roger, was an almost untouchable figure in the eyes of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus spoke of it like it was nothing more than a casual event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that his status was so exalted that even Roger seemed insignificant to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine pondered this thought, but soon dismissed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marcus had an extraordinary background, there was no way he could be on the same level as Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The business car soon arrived at Kingston Airport, and the two boarded a flight to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they landed, Maxine went to the Solomia Special Police Academy, while Diana was there to pick up Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As before, Maxine was struck by the same delicate features of Marcus' face, and her curiosity about his identity only deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, your cultivation has improved again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noticed the shift in Marcus' aura and her eyes lit up with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a stroke of luck, nothing significant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied humbly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar must have sent someone after you again, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked, as though nothing escaped her notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know more than just that. I also know about every part of your journey to Kingston. Would you like me to tell you all about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said with a playful glint in her bright blue eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few lines of sweat appeared on Marcus' forehead, his gaze drifting to the micro submachine gun strapped to Diana's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That reminded him of the time Diana had modified the weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her enhancements, the gun's power had increased several times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was now capable of threatening experts above Ancient Martial Art Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If such guns could be mass-produced, Marcus could form a formidable team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he couldn't gather many people, it would still be a force to reckon with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so much going on lately, Marcus hadn't had a chance to check up on the progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to ask, "Diana, how's the weapon modification going? Did it succeed? Can it be mass-produced now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana adjusted her hair as she responded, "The weapon modification is almost complete. The only thing we're missing now is the energy crystal. It can only be produced from crystal veins, and the southwest region of </span><span>Uswad</span><span> is the only place that has them. I've been wanting to check it out. If the price is right, I could buy some energy crystals to help me modify more weapons."</span></p><div class="pagination">
