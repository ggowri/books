"Natalia, this is a get-together with your classmates, right? You should go. I will tag along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia blinked those big, bright eyes. The moment she heard Marcus was coming with her, she visibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's real. When have I ever lied to you?" Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, if you're with me, then I'm in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia nodded obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and Judy rolled their eyes, wondering what kind of voodoo Marcus had put on Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd been working their butts off to convince Natalia, all to no avail. Yet, with just one sentence from Marcus, Natalia was on board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Harvey they'd all been mentioning was another student at Kingston University. They shared the same academic year but were divided into different classrooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Harvey was from the Burnett family in Kingston but not a direct descendant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't in the same league as Maxine, the second young lady of the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to college girls like Melina and Judy, Harvey was the whole package: handsome, charming, and with a seriously impressive pedigree. He was the Prince Charming of Kingston University, the guy every girl dreamed of snagging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone could hook up with Harvey, they'd be the envy of the entire campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Harvey was footing the bill, the party was being held in a ridiculously luxurious VIP room at the </span><span>Bulgaly</span><span> Hotel in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus followed Natalia, Melina, Judy, and the other girls into the private room, Harvey was already there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey was flanked by two other guys, all of them dressed in the latest high-end designer fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey and his friends' eyes lit up when they saw Natalia and the other girls arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simple math: Natalia, Melina, and Judy were all certified knockouts, famous beauties on the Kingston University campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia, in particular, was known as the department's reigning queen. She had guys lining up to ask her out and was seen as this untouchable, pure princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was even rumored that some photography-obsessed classmate had racked up millions of followers online by secretly snapping photos of Natalia around campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All this had caught Harvey's attention, so he'd gone through Melina and Judy, wanting to get to know Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and Judy, knowing Harvey's background, had jumped at the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's how they ended up at the gates of Kingston University earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides Natalia, Melina, and Judy, the dozen or so other girls who'd come along were also stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one of them was a beauty, easily on par with a celebrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was enough to make Harvey and his crew practically drool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But among all these beauties, there was one figure that just didn't fit. It was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey and the other two couldn't help but frown, but they didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, playing the perfect gentleman, turned his attention to Natalia, his eyes full of admiration. He asked Melina, "I'm guessing this is our campus beauty, the pure princess, Natalia, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina nodded gracefully. "You've got a good eye, Mr. Burnett. This is Natalia. What do you think? Pretty enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey smiled, his eyes glued to Natalia, unable to look away. "You're right, but I think Natalia is ten times more beautiful in person than in those photos online!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy immediately clapped her hands, giving Harvey a thumbs up. "Mr. Burnett, you've got a way with words. Our Natalia is the campus queen and an internet sensation. Of course, she won't let you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a member of one of Kingston's top families, Harvey wasn't just looking for a pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, Judy, and the other dozen or so girls all had impressive family backgrounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, they wouldn't be here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the girls all behaved with perfect grace and poise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Melina and Judy, it was their first time having dinner with Harvey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were chatting away with him like old friends, a testament to their social skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's this? Can you introduce him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey's gaze finally landed on Marcus. Seeing that Marcus was actually sitting next to Natalia, his curiosity spiked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Marcus, Natalia's relative. He came all the way from Solomia to Kingston to see Natalia. He just came along with her. You don't mind, do you, Mr. Burnett?" Melina explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The casual closeness between Natalia and Marcus made it glaringly obvious that this was no ordinary familial connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey's brow furrowed slightly, but he quickly smoothed it out, putting on a show of generosity. "Since you're Natalia's relative, it's only natural you'd come along. I'm the host today, so don't be shy. Eat, drink, and enjoy yourselves. After all, you probably don't see places this high-end back in Solomia."</span></p><div class="pagination">
