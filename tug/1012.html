  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Yasser spoke, the faces of the Tucker family's top members, including Brett, instantly turned pale with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected the young man standing before them to be so bold and reckless. He killed the Four Guardians and even busted into the Tucker family's dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Marcus was holding Gertie's hand, and that alone made several members of the Tucker family shoot him murderous glares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was supposed to be Yasser's fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had she been with Marcus before, but now she was openly flaunting their relationship in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a traditional Ancient Martial Art family like the Tucker family, this was an absolute humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, I'm curious. What gives you the right to act like this? What's your confidence based on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's cold eyes scanned Marcus, his voice laced with mockery as he spoke, testing Marcus' resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus' killing of the Four Guardians had caught him off guard, Brett didn't believe Marcus had the ability to walk away from the Tucker family unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not here for a chat," Marcus replied, his tone calm but carrying a dangerous edge. "You touched my woman, so who's coming first to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even bother to look at Brett, his words deliberate and unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice wasn't loud, but it carried an undeniable pressure, like a storm just waiting to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie looked up at the tall man beside her, feeling a rush of emotions, conflicted, yet strangely relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think just because you killed the Four Guardians, you can act like you're untouchable in the Tucker family. Let me show you what happens when you get too cocky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man stepped forward, his eyes sharp like blades, his tone icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one of the Tucker family's elders, Howard Tucker, a newly advanced practitioner who'd reached the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference between the Foundation Establishment Stage and the Return Essence stage was night and day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching the Return Essence stage meant entering an entirely different league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Howard was supremely confident in his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, even though Marcus had killed the Four Guardians, he still wasn't a match for someone at Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not even close to my level. Why don't you bring out your family's three Grandmasters instead?" Marcus glanced at Howard, speaking coolly, almost dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Howard's face turned red with anger. He hadn't expected Marcus to be so audacious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth, Howard hissed, "I don't get it. You may have killed the Four Guardians, but what makes you think you can act so arrogantly in front of me? I'm an expert at the Return Essence stage. Killing you is like squashing an ant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Howard unleashed a terrifying aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around them seemed to thicken with pressure as the full might of Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage One erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, he slammed his palm forward, a massive wave of destructive force surging toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no holding back. All the power was poured into that one strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very space around them seemed to tremble under the sheer intensity of the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family members gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew Howard well. His talent wasn't remarkable, and even when he was at the Ancient Martial Stage Nine, his strength was considered mediocre at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after advancing to the Return Essence stage, it was like he'd transformed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of terrifying attack made everyone uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An expert's power at the Return Essence stage was no joke. A single strike from them could easily crush someone at the Foundation Establishment stage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
