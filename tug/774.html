  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of overwhelming pressure emerged from the void, enveloping the three figures in its oppressive grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael immediately fell to his knees, his expression devout as he began to pray fervently toward the castle before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Ada simply stood by, watching him in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What brings you here, humans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice echoed from the void, ethereal and ancient, its tone carrying the weight of countless ages. It resonated deeply, shaking them to their core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus responded calmly, "We've come to earn the right to pass through the space-time tunnel and to seek the Return Essence Crystal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke plainly, withholding nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To earn the right to pass through the space-time tunnel, you must conquer the first six of the nine levels ahead," the voice announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can clear the first six levels, not only will you gain access to the space-time tunnel, but I will also reward you with three Return Essence Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice carried a tempting allure, its offer almost too good to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes lit up with a fervent glint. He asked, "I have a few questions. Will you answer them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," the voice replied without hesitation. "Ask away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus began, "If I clear the levels and gain the qualification to pass the space-time tunnel, but I don't want to venture into the world beyond the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall right away, can this right be postponed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, three Return Essence Crystals won't suffice. Can we negotiate for more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three crystals were barely enough for him, Ada, and Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were others by his side who were nearing the Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With time, even more, would reach that stage, and Marcus knew he'd need more Return Essence Crystals to help them enter the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The qualification is valid for life. As long as you live, you will automatically gain access to the space-time tunnel whenever you approach it," the voice explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the crystals, three is the maximum reward for clearing the first six levels. If you want more, you'll have to conquer the higher levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For every level beyond the sixth that you clear, your reward will double. For instance, if you conquer all nine levels, you'll earn 24 Return Essence Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice answered each of Marcus' questions methodically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Marcus' eyes gleamed with determination. "Then I'll give it a try. I hope you'll keep your word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've guarded this place for millennia," the voice replied with a hint of disdain. "Do you think I'd bother lying to a mere human? You'd better think more about how to clear the first six levels first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your strength is insufficient, regardless of any rewards I promise, you simply won't be able to attain it. You might even pay with your life. And then, all of this will be meaningless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice carried an air of contempt, making it clear it didn't believe Marcus could succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't argue. He knew his abilities would speak for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Raphael and Ada, he said, "Wait for me here. I'll face the trials alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's face was etched with worry as she urged, "Be careful. If it's too dangerous, give up. Don't let pride get the better of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her time with Marcus had taught her he was a man who refused to yield, even in the face of overwhelming odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feared he might press on recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the voice had warned, if that happened, Marcus could even lose his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a reassuring glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the enormous castle doors creaked open on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden light poured out, dazzling yet exuding a foreboding sense of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, the doors closed slowly, sealing him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, his surroundings shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The opulent castle faded away, replaced by a vast and desolate space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an endless expanse of sky and earth, utterly barren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavens above were pitch-black, devoid of stars, sun, or moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as though this strange world had been crafted solely for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a light flared in the distance ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glow intensified, taking the form of a human figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the figure solidified, Marcus' eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe his eyes. It was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need not panic," the voice from earlier spoke again. "The trials of this castle are simple. To ascend to a higher world, you need only defeat yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected the trial to be like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, the other Marcus raised his hand, summoning the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. In a flash, he unleashed a devastating handprint infused with overwhelming destructive energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attack combined the powers of Timeless Numinous Energy, </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power, and Rune Power swirling with lethal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Marcus' strength was identical to his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Illusion," Marcus thought instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that this trial was, without a doubt, an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this illusion was unnervingly real. It felt like he was experiencing it firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the destructive Hand Strike was upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Marcus barely managed to summon a Fist Ray in defense. The impact sent him stumbling backward, blood churning in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine," he muttered to himself. "This version of me is just as strong as I am. Defeating it won't be easy." Determined, Marcus threw himself into the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on, fiercer than he had anticipated. An hour passed with neither side gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent was relentless, perfectly mirroring his every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse still, while Marcus grew fatigued, the illusion seemed inexhaustible, fighting with mechanical precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Marcus in a difficult position, retreating step by step as his opponent pushed him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated but undeterred, Marcus swallowed several energy-replenishing pills and pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though draining, the battle revealed his weaknesses with startling clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized the flaws in his combat techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he understood the true meaning behind the idea that to defeat others, one must first defeat oneself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The castle's challenges were more than mere obstacles. They were a crucible, designed to refine those who dared to face them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent might wield identical powers, but as an illusion, it lacked the ability to adapt and improve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Marcus' combat skills evolved with every passing moment. After more than an hour of fighting, Marcus identified his weaknesses and areas for improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle had improved his ability, while his opponent remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing this, he adjusted his strategy, targeting the weaknesses in his mirrored self. Slowly but surely, the tide of battle began to turn in his favor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
