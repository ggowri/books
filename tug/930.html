  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire alone was much better than this man's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, even if this man's cultivation was the same as Marcus', their strength was definitely not on the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this man had absolute confidence in his own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Endless flames rose up around him. In an instant, he shot several Hand Strikes towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The magic light contained in each Hand Strike was extremely strong, and there was also a terrifying Fire Attribute Power fused in it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wherever it passed, it seemed that everything would be melted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a moment, Marcus' body was wrapped in the endless flames. If it were someone else, they would definitely be burned to ashes by the flames.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus was not an ordinary man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing this terrifying flame, Marcus was unmoved, and his body was covered by a faint light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This light was like an invisible armor that completely protected Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the flames were extremely fierce, they still couldn't hurt Marcus at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene immediately shocked that man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The flames he just released were equivalent to the strongest power of his attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it couldn't do anything to Marcus. </span><span>So</span><span> what level of strength did Marcus reach?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prins' brother didn't have time to think about it. He roared and took a quick step forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Fire Attribute Power lingering on his body was obviously stronger than before, containing an extremely terrifying destructive power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He blasted a fire Fist Ray directly at Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This fire Fist Ray was earth-shattering. In just a moment, it seemed to turn into a giant fire dragon, devouring Marcus madly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, still walked forward step by step, as if strolling in the garden.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the giant fire dragon was about to descend, he casually blasted out with a fist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The giant fire dragon let out a mournful sound and was directly shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Marcus continued to step forward. His steps seemed slow, but he appeared in front of Prins' brother in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smashed out another terrifying Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This fist also seemed to have no power at all, but it immediately completely enveloped the man's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prins' brother looked extremely horrified. He had never thought that Marcus' strength would be so strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared again, mobilizing all the potential in his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He madly launched an attack on Marcus' Fist Ray. In addition to the power of magic, this attack also had extremely terrifying fire power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, there was a rumbling sound of terrifying shock, and the extremely terrifying destructive force spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His attack was shattered by Marcus' Fist Ray, and turned into a stream of destructive light that scattered in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the power of Marcus' Fist Ray did not weaken at all, and it fell in front of his body in just a blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is it possible? How? My cultivation is at Demon Fighter level three. The power of my attack is not something that ordinary people can contend with. How can you destroy my attack with a casual Fist Ray? What's your cultivation?" the man asked in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't wait for an answer. Everything was over with Marcus' fist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, accompanied by a terrifying vibration sound, Marcus' fist landed directly on his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could scream, a huge bloody hole was blasted out of his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All his bones, organs, and cells were shattered. He died!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Alison's face look even uglier. Her eyes changed when she looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help but ask Marcus, "What's your cultivation? Why can you easily kill an expert at Demon Fighter level three?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
