  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua thought this call was to place more orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have sufficient raw material stock. I'm calling you to inform you that Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture decided to cancel its cooperation with you. Come to the financial department to square up with us when you have time," said the person in a deep voice over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frozen in shock, he doubted whether his hearing went wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he came back to his senses and questioned, "I signed a contract with the Golden Group! How can they possibly cancel the cooperation? You must be joking, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While questioning, Joshua's voice quivered as it was totally unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only resort to the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the person over the phone claimed, "Sorry, that is a unilateral contract, which means the Golden Group reserves the final right of interpretation and execution and has the right to cancel the cooperation. I'm sorry, but your cooperation has been canceled for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed, Joshua was stunned in great disbelief as soon as he heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gaped at the void as his phone almost slipped out of his hand. The moment he wanted to say something, the person on the other side of the phone hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua, what happened? Did the Golden Group urge the shipment of more raw material?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Joshua shuffling back to the dinner table, Hannah asked in the same thinking pattern as Joshua who hadn't answered that call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a distorted face, he responded with gritted teeth, "The Golden Group abandoned me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disbelief was brimming in everyone's eyes as they heard what he said, especially Molly and Hannah, who thought there was something wrong with their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua said he had a solid cooperation with the Golden Group, which contradicted the fact that he was not an option of its supplier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but associate this dramatic change with the phone call Marcus just made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought left everyone in fear as they all changed the way they looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-you actually told the Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture to cancel the cooperation with Joshua?" Molly asked in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know anyone else who can do that?" said Marcus indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Hannah and Molly could get out of the great shock, Marcus fixed his eyes on Joshua. "Time to deliver on your promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face turned ashen. To fulfill his promise meant kneeling in front of Marcus, his love rival who was much younger than him, and licking his shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctance mounted in his heart, preventing him from even moving his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus' insistence shocked everyone and made them even more curious about his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was hard to suppress the curiosity of someone who made the Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture sever its cooperation with a rather important supplier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they realized that Josie didn't lie about his prominence, with their curiosity about him surging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let me waste my time. Kneel and lick my shoes!" Not seeing Joshua moving, Marcus kindly reminded him, but this kind of kindness was rapidly fading in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua frowned deeply at this condescending order and responded with gritted teeth, "It's just a joke, kiddo. You actually mean to make me kneel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, he couldn't kneel in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would completely destroy his self-esteem and fame in the old classmate circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, Marcus wouldn't let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gamblers had to keep their word. That was how gambling worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the situation reversed, Joshua would try his best to cease Marcus and Josie's relationship and claim her to be his girlfriend regardless of her own will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Marcus, dealing with such a scumbag who tried to snatch his woman required no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he uttered these words, he stepped forward to grip Joshua's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, looking so embarrassed and furious, tried to shake Marcus' hand off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he felt that Marcus' hand was like iron pliers that made all his attempts to get rid of his grip in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you doing? Let me go, or I'll beat you up!" Joshua yelled at Marcus in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't feel like wasting time talking nonsense to Joshua and exerted overwhelming force on Joshua's shoulder, so heavy as to almost cause bone fractures in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to bear this pressure, Joshua suddenly felt his legs become weak and knelt right in front of Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing an unheralded fight breaking out stunned everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? How can you hit him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing what was happening, Molly stepped forward to pull Marcus away while saying to Josie, "See? That's the man you fall in love with, a rude jerk who only resorts to violence! How can you let such a savage have you, Josie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said that, Molly tried to pull Marcus' hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Piss off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't even give her a chance to get close to him as Molly was shoved away by the casual sway of his arm. Stepping forward and hitting the wall, she suffered the sharp pain and almost tumbled, glaring at Marcus in greater rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, on the other hand, didn't even glance at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such people were never worth his attention. Then, he grabbed Joshua's head and smashed it down to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could hear the dull sound of his head hitting the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This simple strike had already made him dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you doing?! Let me go! I said, let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his head being grabbed, Joshua felt so humiliated yet powerless to resist Marcus' attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In ten seconds, lick my shoes, or you will have the greatest nightmare in your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring his hamstrung threats, Marcus coldly declared his ultimatum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dealing with people like Joshua was like dog training. He needed to totally crush his mental defense in case he would bark at him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kiss my ass! You'll pay the price of insulting me today! I swear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua replied with gritted teeth. He was totally unaware of what kind of horrible things would happen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sighing, Marcus knew Joshua needed to learn a lesson before understanding how to stay humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he also grabbed Joshua's hair to continue smashing his head to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the skull hitting the ground echoed in the box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his head bled as he kept screaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sure that if Marcus continued like this, his head would end up like jam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene also shocked everyone present. No one had expected that Marcus would be so ruthless.</span></p><div class="pagination">
