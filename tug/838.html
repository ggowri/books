  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not. Don't worry. I promise," Marcus said, kissing Josie's forehead with a look of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie blinked her eyes. "I know you have a lot of women around you, and many of them are better than me. That's why I've never been confident, and I'm always afraid you'll leave me." As she spoke, her eyes turned a little red, and her voice choked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't an act&mdash;she was genuinely upset. She loved Marcus so much and was terrified of losing him. She had no idea how she'd survive without him. This constant fear made her anxious that one day Marcus would walk out of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pulled Josie into his arms and whispered, "Trust me, Ms. Shelman. I said I won't leave you, and I mean it. Don't you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into Marcus' sincere eyes, Josie nodded vigorously and kissed him again, as if she couldn't get enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, isn't it time for your class reunion? You should get ready," Marcus said, trying to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie suddenly snapped back to reality, jumping out of bed and giving Marcus a playful glare. "We agreed on 2 p.m., and it's already noon. I still need to do my makeup. This is all your fault. What if I'm late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, a few lines appearing on his forehead. Women could change their minds fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie rushed into the bathroom and began to wash her body. It took her a while, but when she emerged, she looked amazing. If it weren't for her afternoon commitments, Marcus would have been tempted to take her right there again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Josie spent another half-hour doing her makeup and tried on a few outfits, asking Marcus to pick one. He finally chose a light-colored dress. Josie was tall, with fair skin and a very elegant look. The dress really brought out her sophisticated aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, do I look good?" Josie smiled sweetly at Marcus. Despite being over 30, she looked like she could pass for her twenties after a good grooming session.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Appearance and age had a lot to do with one's demeanor. As an elegant female CEO, Josie generally looked younger than her peers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the two hurried downstairs, got into Josie's nearly 10-year-old Mercedes-Benz, and headed to the reunion venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Josie introduced Marcus to her two best friends from college, Hannah and Molly. The three had been in the same class and shared a dorm. They hadn't seen each other since Josie's wedding six years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was now married to a senior executive at a large multinational pharmaceutical company, while Molly's husband, Jace, was in the top 20 on Kingston's local rich list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides Hannah and Molly, a male classmate named Joshua Sanders, who was close to the three girls, would also be attending the reunion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had always had a crush on Josie but was too shy to confess back in school. Everyone could see his feelings, and Hannah and Molly had tried to set Josie up with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Josie, focused on her studies, had turned him down. Later, they all went their separate ways, and Josie got married to her ex-husband. When Joshua heard the news, he was really hurt and took half a year to get over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chose a famous restaurant in Kingston called Fortune Palace for the reunion. After parking the car, Marcus took Josie's hand and walked into the lobby. Fortune Palace had a century-long history and six floors. The moment they entered, they were greeted by an antique vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, you're here!" Hannah, Molly, and Joshua, who were around Josie's age, waved and smiled from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they didn't look as young as Josie, both Hannah and Molly exuded the charm and grace of women their age. They were definitely campus beauties back in school and still looked stunning even though they were married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, tall and well-dressed in a tailored suit, looked as dashing as ever. He had been a campus heartthrob with many admirers but had always had a thing for Josie, who kept rejecting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing Marcus with Josie, Joshua was a mix of scrutiny and coldness. He had always dreamed of being the man by Josie's side, protecting her. But he failed, and his dream girl became someone else's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after Josie's husband died, Joshua offered to be with her, but she still turned him down. So when he saw Josie again, his expression was not only complicated but also tinged with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, Molly, Joshua, you guys made it pretty fast," Josie said, glancing at the three of them with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah and Molly looked at Marcus curiously and a bit critically. "Josie, is this your boyfriend?" Hannah asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded with a smile. "Yes, let me introduce you. This is Marcus. He's from Solomia in Solace, and he's 23 years old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah and Molly exchanged glances, clearly surprised. "He's quite young," Molly said. "Josie, you're eight years older than him. And he does look pretty handsome and fresh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah added, "Back in school, Josie was always into looks, and it seems she hasn't changed. You still go for these young hunks. But seriously, don't you think it's better to find someone more reliable to remarry? It would help your career and stabilize your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, young guys like him are still unsettled. There are too many uncertainties," Molly continued, glancing at Josie and Marcus holding hands affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree with Hannah. And Josie, if you wanted someone handsome, what about Joshua? He was the school heartthrob back then, and you didn't even give him a chance. I'm curious what this young guy has that made you fall for him," Molly teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie defended Marcus. "Hannah, Molly. Marcus is more than just good-looking. He's very capable and has actually helped a lot with my career. We'll talk more about it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Josie squeezed Marcus' hand a little tighter. Joshua, watching from a distance, felt a chill in his heart and clenched his teeth in frustration.</span></p><div class="pagination">
