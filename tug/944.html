  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her internal organs and cells underwent rapid evolution, a testament to the transformative power of the magic she absorbed. Marcus, recognizing this critical moment in her cultivation, channeled the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to infuse the Saint's Stone with Timeless Numinous Energy. This fusion of energies created a potent catalyst, propelling Diana towards the coveted Saint Magician State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The process was delicate, requiring precision and control. Marcus meticulously manipulated the energy, ensuring a seamless integration within Diana's body. Meanwhile, Diana tapped into her reserves, harmonizing her aura with the surging energies from the Saint's Stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, at a pivotal moment, Diana felt a surge of power coursing through her, her aura expanding exponentially. The culmination of her efforts had reached its zenith, and she had achieved the breakthrough she sought. Diana had ascended to the realm of the Saint Magician, a master of her craft, her potential limitless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's progress in cultivation had left Alison far behind. It was remarkable, considering Diana once lagged behind Alison in skill. However, since joining Marcus, </span><span>her cultivation has advanced by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had soared from Demon Fighter Stage Seven to an impressive Saint Magician Stage One! This was especially significant because Diana's cultivation had stagnated for years before meeting Marcus. Yet, in just a few months under his guidance, she had made incredible progress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Overjoyed by her advancement, Diana didn't let up. She continued to refine her techniques, consolidating her gains until she felt fully secure in her new level. Only then did she pause, exhaling a long breath. Her perfect figure was covered in a fragrant sweat, a testament to her efforts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her beautiful eyes sparkled as she gazed at Marcus, her face filled with gratitude. "Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, "thank you. Without you, I might never have reached the Saint Magician level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, slightly pale from the exertion, smiled at Diana and said, "You're my woman. There's no need for formalities between us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blushed at his words, a touch of shyness gracing her beautiful features. "Even so, I must thank you. After all, the Saint's Stone is incredibly valuable. You could have used it to acquire other cultivation resources, which would have greatly benefited you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spoke softly, her gaze drifting away from Marcus' intense eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's not important," Marcus replied, eyes sweeping over Diana's perfect figure. "What matters most is that you continue to engage in Dual Cultivation with me. Think about it. Hasn't your cultivation progressed rapidly ever since we started?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, still unclothed after her breakthrough, sat across from Marcus, her bare skin glowing. Her full breasts, flat stomach, and the lush triangle of hair between her legs were visible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the fatigue from helping Diana advance, Marcus felt a stirring of desire as he took in her flawless figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're so annoying!" Diana exclaimed, her cheeks flushing crimson. Marcus' words had flustered her, and she couldn't help but playfully glare at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, despite her playful protest, Diana couldn't deny the truth in his words. Her cultivation had skyrocketed since she began engaging in Dual Cultivation with him. Not only did it accelerate her progress, but the experience was undeniably pleasurable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when Marcus wasn't around, Diana thought about those moments, a subtle longing stirring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Am I wrong?" Marcus asked with a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know the answer, so why ask?" Diana retorted, her face now burning with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite her stunning figure, Diana was rather shy, especially regarding love. Although she had already developed feelings for Marcus, she was too timid to express them openly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus burst into laughter at Diana's words. "You said you wanted to thank me," he chuckled, "so how about we do it again? Consider it repayment for my kindness."</span></p><div class="pagination">
