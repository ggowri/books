  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't calm his mind for a long time. If what the figure said was true, then he also might be a prisoner exiled here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The outside world does indeed call this place a prison. However, due to changes in the laws of heaven and earth over the past few thousand years, this world has been completely sealed off from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No new prisoners have been exiled here in a long time. As a result, this world has gradually formed its own order and rules, almost becoming an independent realm of its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And during these millennia, some enlightened individuals from this world have successfully passed through the space-time gate to explore the lands beyond the Ice Wall of </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>. Some have even achieved great things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you shouldn't belittle yourself. At the very least, I can see that your cultivation has already reached the Return Essence stage. If you venture beyond the Ice Wall, you will surely make a name for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice of the shadowy figure carried a trace of reassurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gazed at the figure and suddenly thought of another question. He asked, "You said that many people like you have integrated into this world and are living as its inhabitants. But if they look anything like you, wouldn't they be easily recognized?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked this because the figure before him didn't resemble an ordinary human but looked more like a ghostly entity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure seemed somewhat melancholic at his words and replied, "The reason I appear like this is because when I attempted to return to the Ancient Land of Anak, my physical body was destroyed by the constraining force of this space. That's why I exist only as a remnant soul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes flickered with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected the constraining force of this world to be so powerful that it could completely annihilate someone's physical form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you can't restore your body, you'll have no chance of returning home, will you?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure appeared even more desolate and sighed. "That's most likely the case. For now, I can only take things one step at a time. But as I continue existing in this world as a remnant soul, my spiritual power is depleting rapidly. It won't be long before I completely dissipate and vanish forever..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Marcus frowned slightly. He immediately asked, "Do you need my help? If there's anything I can do for you, just say the word. If it's within my power, I won't hesitate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure paused, and a faint glow flickered across its form as if it had suddenly become hopeful. "If you're willing to help, that would be wonderful. I don't need you to do much, just make some space in your Spirit Core so that my remnant soul can temporarily reside there. That alone would be a tremendous favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow at the request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Allowing a foreign soul to inhabit his Spirit Core? That sounded insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never encountered anything like this before and had no way of knowing if it posed any risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure quickly added, "Don't worry. I have no ill intentions toward you. If my soul enters your Spirit Core, it won't affect your cultivation or daily life. Once I'm inside, I will fall into a deep sleep until I either return to my homeland or find a way to restore my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if you ever find yourself in danger, I can assist you as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as those words fell, the figure unleashed a terrifying energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like an immense and suffocating prison that instantly enveloped Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brief moment, Marcus felt completely powerless. Under the overwhelming pressure, he couldn't move, and he could only submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sensation lasted only for a second before it completely vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze toward the figure changed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that this entity was far beyond his ability to handle. Even in its weakened state as a remnant soul, it could still kill him effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, despite its immense power, the figure remained composed and spoke with him in a reasonable manner. This suggested that it truly bore him no ill will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I'll make space for you," Marcus finally agreed. "But I warn you. Don't even think about betraying me. If you do, I'll fight you to the death, even if it means taking you down with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they were essentially strangers, he had no choice but to remain cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, thank you! If I ever return home or regain my physical body, I will repay your kindness in full."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure's voice carried unmistakable excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without hesitation, it transformed into a stream of light and merged with Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shudder ran through Marcus as he felt the entity entering his Spirit Core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the figure condensed into a tiny speck of light and quietly floated within his Spirit Core, falling into dormancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no noticeable impact on Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After carefully verifying that everything was normal, Marcus finally let go of his doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure if this was the right decision. But from the moment he heard the figure's story, he had instinctively wanted to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether that instinct was right or wrong, he could only wait and see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off his thoughts, Marcus stepped into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already 11:00 at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and Pearl had both gone to their rooms to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Diana was still, working in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the strongest support behind Marcus, Diana spent every day, aside from her training, dealing with various matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her working so hard, Marcus' heart ached for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He silently approached from behind and pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So focused on her work, Diana hadn't even noticed Marcus entering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling someone embrace her from behind, she gasped in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she turned and saw it was Marcus, she let out a relieved sigh. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you scared me! You should have let me know you were back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled. He could feel the warmth of Diana's soft body against his, as well as the subtle fragrance that lingered around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his embrace and said playfully, "I wanted to surprise you. That's why I didn't say anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana rolled her eyes at him. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you always know how to say the right things. I wonder how many women you've sweet-talked like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? I'm only telling the truth. And yet, you don't believe me?" Marcus grinned mischievously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand had already moved, firmly grasping Diana's ample chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his touch, Diana instinctively tried to push his hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus only held her tighter, his fingers teasingly pressing against the sensitive peaks of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran through Diana as if an electric current had coursed through her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a soft moan. "Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you doing? We're in the living room..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she said that, her face turned crimson as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately understood her unspoken message. Without hesitation, he scooped her up in his arms and carried her toward her room.</span></p><div class="pagination">
