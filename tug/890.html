Since you're so eager to throw your life away, I'll be happy to help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a powerful aura erupted from his body as he casually stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His figure vanished from sight, only to reappear instantly before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed a devastating Hand Strike at Marcus, the attack crackling with terrifying destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the true power of a Return Essence stage expert's Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its might was earth-shattering. Even this casual attack made the entire space feel oppressive, as if the destructive force could harness the very Source Power of heaven and earth to tear Marcus' body to shreds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't take these two opponents lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would technically be his first real fight against Return Essence stage practitioners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His previous encounter with Alison didn't count since Diana had stepped in to shield him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was facing two of them head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the odds, Marcus remained unfazed, even though these two appeared to be at his State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he wasn't just any practitioner. He had achieved the Hidden State!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power couldn't hold a candle to his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus countered their Hand Strike with a seemingly simple punch that appeared to lack real force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack collided with their Hand Strike in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact unleashed a thunderous boom that shook the heavens, sending destructive forces rippling in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man smiled mockingly, surprised by Marcus' audacity to meet his attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He poured more destructive force into his Hand Strike, determined to finish Marcus </span><span>off with this single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as their attacks continued to clash increasingly, the middle-aged man suddenly felt the devastating power emanating from Marcus' Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That deceptively simple Fist Ray contained an unstoppable force beneath its plain exterior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the overwhelming force, his Hand Strike instantly shattered, while the Fist Ray maintained its full devastating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack struck him directly, sending him staggering backward as his chest churned with turbulent energy, forcing him to swallow back the blood that rose to his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This display caused the other middle-aged man's gaze to freeze, his face twisting with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected your cultivation to reach Acquired State Two," he said. "No wonder you dare act arrogantly against the two of us. Since that's the case, don't blame us for using our numbers to our advantage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two middle-aged men released their auras simultaneously, causing the entire space to grow heavy with pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, they appeared as lords of this domain, wielding power over everything within it, including the lives of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attacks came as soon as their words ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A destructive light flashed through the space, rapidly evolving into a terrifying cage that descended upon Marcus' form in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sword energy continuously erupted within the cage, creating a deadly crosshatch of blade lights that threatened to slice anything trapped inside into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed as he observed the true power of those who had reached the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference in strength between this and the Foundation Establishment Stage was truly astronomical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between experts of these two stages existed in entirely different dimensions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While their attacks might appear similar on the surface, the energy driving them was fundamentally different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing this terrifying cage, Marcus didn't hesitate as he launched another powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fist Ray pierced through heaven and earth, colliding with the barrier cage in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fist struck the cage with a thunderous explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cage shook violently as its surface patterns began to warp and crack within seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another devastating boom, Marcus shattered the cage with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, executing the Shadow Step technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he appeared before one of the middle-aged men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire activated, wreathing his Hand Strike in Timeless Numinous Energy. At the same time, the Heavenly Circle Diagram patterns manifested within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This combination elevated his Hand Strike's power to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's eyes narrowed as he sensed Marcus' Hand Strike's overwhelming power, and his face turned pale with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately realized he couldn't withstand this Hand Strike. Still, when he tried to dodge, he found himself completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible Binding Force had frozen him in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left with no choice, he channeled every ounce of power in his body, unleashing his ultimate attack to counter Marcus' Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision unleashed a thunderous roar as destructive forces exploded outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their attacks met, the middle-aged man's strike crumpled like paper against Marcus' overwhelming Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' attack grew even more potent as it closed in on the middle-aged man's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's eyes widened in disbelief as he stammered, "How is this possible? Our cultivation levels are supposed to be equal, so why is your attack power so overwhelming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he know that Marcus had mastered the Hidden State, equivalent to advancing two minor realms within the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In practical terms, Marcus' base level of Acquired State Two and mastery of the Hidden State effectively placed him at Acquired State Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His combat prowess was further enhanced by his refined cultivation techniques and the extensive battle experience he had gained over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus were to unleash his full potential, he could even hold his own against experts at Acquired State Six or higher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two opponents before him, mere Acquired State Two practitioners, couldn't even be considered in the same league as Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored the middle-aged man's desperate questions and delivered a brutal Hand Strike to his opponent's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion rang out as Marcus' devastating palm strike tore the middle-aged man's body to pieces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like that, another Acquired State Stage Two warrior met his brutal end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining middle-aged man watched in </span><span>horror,</span><span> his face frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never would have imagined that this young man, who looked barely over twenty, could possess such terrifying power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had known Marcus' true strength, they would not have dared mess with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it was too late, as Marcus approached him step by step with an intimidating presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat beaded on his forehead as he frantically reached for a yellowed teleportation amulet from his Spatial Ring, desperately hoping to crush it and make his escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't about to give him that chance, as his large hand clamped down firmly on the man's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man instinctively tried to launch a counterattack against Marcus' arm. Still, he felt an overwhelming Devouring Power surge from Marcus' palm, instantly enveloping his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror flashed across the middle-aged man's face as he watched his own Numinous </span><span>Energy drain away at an alarming rate, steadily flowing into Marcus' body!</span></p><div class="pagination">
