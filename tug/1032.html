If they weren't surrounded by people, he might've dragged her off right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a man in black strode into the venue, moving with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a beeline for Miles, leaned in, and muttered, "Mr. Donovan, Chloe won't budge on the Best Female Singer award. Aidan and the guys tried to rough her up, but the man with her wiped the floor with them. They're all on their way to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' face darkened instantly, his gaze snapping to Chloe and Marcus, something cold flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stare lingered on Marcus, sizing him up.</span><br><span>This kid looks ordinary enough, but clearly, there is more to him than met the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aidan and his crew aren't just street thugs&mdash;they are professionals, battle-tested, the kind of guys who can take out a room full of amateurs without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yet this guy has put them all in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That is... unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, Chloe's disobedience also pissed Miles off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Donovan, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena's voice was soft, but she wasn't fooling anyone&mdash;she'd picked up on the shift in his mood right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles filled her in, his voice low and tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena's brows knit together, irritation flashing across her face. "That bitch actually thinks she can say no to you? She's out of her damn mind. And that guy with her? Who the hell does he think he is, laying hands on your people? You can't just let this slide, Mr. Donovan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' fingers tapped against his glass, his expression unreadable. "We'll see. The real owner of Royal Entertainment is showing up tonight. I don't want to do anything that might piss him off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena's eyes widened. "Wait&mdash;you mean Mr. Death? The one everyone's been whispering about in the business world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena had heard the stories about Death&mdash;everyone had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man wrapped in mystery, feared and respected in equal measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like her didn't get to be in the same room as someone like that. Hell, they weren't even supposed to know his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of excitement shot through her, a plan forming in the back of her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he really showed up tonight, she had to make an impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she played this right&mdash;if she caught his eye&mdash;Miles would just be a stepping stone. Death was the kind of man who could change everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if she could get close to him, her future in this industry wouldn't just be secure&mdash;it would be limitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles, oblivious to the shift in her ambitions, gave a curt nod. "That's right. The big man himself. I only got confirmation yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dropped a notch. "So keep your head on straight, Selena. This isn't just some industry big shot&mdash;we can't afford to screw up in front of him. One wrong move, and even I won't be able to help you. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena's eyes gleamed as she nodded. "Crystal clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a tilt of her head, she asked the one thing that really mattered to her. "And my award? That's still happening, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles smirked, giving her hand a squeeze. "Relax, babe. I'll have a word with the presenters backstage. When the time comes, they'll call your name. Chloe won't dare make a scene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was all Selena needed to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Winning Best Female Singer wasn't just about a title or a paycheck&mdash;it was about leverage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A top-tier award meant a seat at the high-rollers' table. The kind of place where real power players took notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena knew exactly what the wealthy elite thought. To them, top-tier actresses weren't just celebrities&mdash;they were status symbols.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that kind of prestige made it a hell of a lot easier to reel in the biggest fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost as if on cue, whispers rippled through the venue&mdash;word had spread. The real owner of Royal Entertainment was arriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement in the air was palpable. Everyone wanted a glimpse of the legend himself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
