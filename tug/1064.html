  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Isolde turned to Chloe. "Chloe, is this the boyfriend you mentioned? What does he do? Where's he from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Marcus Fitzgerald, a Solomia local. He's in the entertainment industry," Chloe answered vaguely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She respected Marcus' desire for privacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Entertainment industry? So, he's in your line of work," Isolde mused, scrutinizing him. "But he looks unfamiliar. What, is he a background actor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Chloe could respond, Eulalia addressed Thorne, "Thorne, what do you think of Chloe? You watch TV and listen to music. Surely, you've seen her. She's one of Uswad's Twelve Rising Stars, blazing hot in the entertainment scene this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's not just a pretty face; she's at her peak. If you two hit it off, I'll play matchmaker. A girl like her is rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marry a star like that, and she'll bring you prestige no matter how far your career takes you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne nodded eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been smitten with Chloe long before meeting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often caught sight of her gracing various films, television dramas, or variety shows with her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was captivated by her youthful charm and elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked even more beautiful in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It deepened his infatuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was sitting beside her. They looked quite intimate. A chill settled in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia turned to Chloe. "Chloe, didn't you hear? Men like Thorne are a dying breed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you on the phone. Entertainment is a young woman's game. When you're old and faded, with no gigs left, how will you support yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women need reliable men, especially one like Thorne. He has a rich family and a thriving career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isolde's looking out for you, setting this up right after getting back. Don't waste this chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde chimed in, "Eulalia's right. This boyfriend of yours? Probably just a background actor. No money, no connections. He'll never make it big in entertainment. Do you think he can support you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We asked you to bring him here today to compare him with Thorne, so you'd see the gap and dump him willingly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their blunt push to break her up with Marcus annoyed Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sulked, "Marcus isn't a background actor. He's an entertainment company boss. You don't need to worry about my future. I'm happy with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Him? An entertainment company boss? Get real. A kid in his early twenties, no wealth, no power, not some scion of a big clan. How could he own a company?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, stop kidding yourself. This isn't a fairy tale for toddlers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eulalia and I are looking out for you. Why are you so stubborn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia added, "Exactly. It's been months, and you've started lying. Do you think you're hot stuff now that you are famous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde scoffed, "Mom, you think her fame means big money? Sure, stars like her look glamorous, with high fees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But after taxes, company cuts, promo costs, and staff expenses, what's left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even at her peak this year, I bet she's barely clearing ten million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's her max. Once she's past her prime, her income will tank."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia nodded, reassured. "Oh, I see. I thought she was raking it in. Ten million dollars is about your salary, but your career only gets better with age, unlike these flash-in-the-pan stars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fixed Chloe with a stern look. "Chloe, you heard me. Dump this kid and marry Thorne. Then you're set for life. I wouldn't steer you wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe frowned at her self-righteous words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia had always been like this, meddling in others' lives under the guise of elder wisdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she offered no real help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, their relentless jabs at Marcus pushed Chloe over the edge. She stood up and said, "Eulalia, Isolde, I appreciate your concern, but I'm an adult. I can judge my path and know what fits me best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't leave Marcus. And frankly, this man isn't as great as you think. Most of that's just your opinion. I'll leave it at that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took Marcus' hand, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, stop right there." Eulalia barked. "You ungrateful girl. When your dad died, he entrusted you and your brother to me. Your marriage needs my approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prove this kid's better than Thorne, or I'll make sure you two are done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde sneered, "Mom, come on. This guy's obviously a nobody. I've never heard of any bigshot named Fitzgerald in Uswad. Chloe's just blinded by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he outshine Thorne? Sales manager at SiliconWave, ten million dollars a year, and parents in high government posts. That's a rare catch. This guy can't compare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne, buoyed by their praise, puffed up with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Ms. Sinclair, I've admired you for ages. Meeting you today is a thrill. But I don't get it. Why settle for this worthless guy? What's he got?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marry me, and with my parents' connections, I'll boost you to true A-list status. No director or executives would dare harass you. That's my guarantee. What can he offer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As Isolde said, he's probably a grunt. If some director tries to sleep with you, he won't just fail to protect you. He might even hand you over himself."</span></p><div class="pagination">
