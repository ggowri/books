Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you say to go to the hotel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina was looking for something in her bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't realize until she finished speaking that she had broken her word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your words, not mine," Marcus smiled.

Melina asked Marcus shyly in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes," Marcus subconsciously answered, then put out the cigarette and asked, "Why did you change into this kind of clothes? Where did you get it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you like it?" Melina asked. She was afraid he didn't like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I like it. I am just a little curious," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I bought it from the Internet and I don't know if you like its style." Melina bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her shyness made people feel pity for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is exactly what I like!" Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was afraid you wouldn't like me anymore after we slept together. So I used this to please you." Melina continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sexy lingerie was every man's thing. She learned that from the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So she wanted to give it a try.</span></p><div class="pagination">
