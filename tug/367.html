Do not be late.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied: [Are you missing me? Why the rush to see me?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine: [Pfft, who is missing you? This is the time set by the organization. Over a dozen police units from all over Uswad are here. I do not want you to mess things up for our academy!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's reply was as blunt as ever, showing no regard for Marcus' teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued teasing her: [If you miss me, just say it. I will come to your school right now. How about that?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, he found teasing Maxine quite amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine replied: [You pervert, what is always on your mind? If I had known, I would not have asked you to collaborate!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending that message, Maxine went silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then entered his training mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Marcus woke up early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl helped him with his bath and getting dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had already prepared breakfast for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Marcus drove his Aston Martin to the Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he entered the parking lot, it was unusually crowded today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many police and civilian vehicles with out-of-town plates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Other units have arrived, let's hurry up and go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Marcus got out of the car, he saw Maxine, dressed in police uniform, walking toward him, looking anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus checked the time, shrugged, and said, "Babe, it is only 8:30. Did you not say before 9? I am not late, so why are you in such a rush?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But everyone else is here&mdash;we are just waiting on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine did not bother with Marcus' teasing and grabbed him, pulling him along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their intimate moment was seen by Edward from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, Edward had his limbs destroyed by Gibson, but thanks to Marcus directing Robert, the surgery was a success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the surgery was successful, Edward no longer had the athletic abilities he once had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, he had now taken a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for this operation, the academy had passed him over and brought in Marcus, who was not even part of the academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward knew he was drifting further away from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl he liked had already fallen for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could say that he had nothing left; everything had been taken by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Edward could not bring himself to hate Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple&mdash;Marcus was not a bad person, and Marcus had never wronged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, during his surgery, Marcus had guided Robert, so he felt indebted to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, seeing Maxine and Marcus so close made Edward feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only silently leave the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus, guided by Maxine, arrived at the Solomia Special Police Academy's Strategic Deployment Office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the underground command center of the Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took them two minutes in the elevator to reach the underground command center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By Marcus' estimate, this place was at least a thousand meters below the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such depth was enough to block any external radar or surveillance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Strategic Deployment Office was now filled with police units from across Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most prominent were the SWAT teams from Kingston, Solariae, Concord, and Veritas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These four police departments were well-known throughout Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had solved many major criminal cases that shocked both Uswad and the world, earning countless achievements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For this operation, these four departments sent their most elite personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because two key figures from the Black Hawk Legion, Abel and Josiah, had recently been active in the Solomia area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the operation was focused in the Solomia area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overall commander was naturally Brenden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Brenden had changed into his combat uniform. Despite being over sixty, he still looked energetic and moved with a commanding presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He publicly read the main strategic deployment for the operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The SWAT officers admired him to some degree, as he was a veteran general who had killed countless enemies on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brenden finished reading the strategic deployment, everyone stood up straight, showing absolute obedience to the orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you have finally arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Brenden finished announcing the strategy, he saw Marcus walking into the Strategic Deployment Office and immediately went to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Wilde"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled at Brenden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all eyes were on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was curious about Marcus who had earned the honor of being personally greeted by Brenden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were all elite members of police units from across Uswad, and none of them had received such treatment as Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would like to introduce everyone. This is Mr. Fitzgerald, the second member of our Uswad Special Police Academy to join this operation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden introduced Marcus to the group.</span></p><div class="pagination">
