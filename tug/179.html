  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin shook his head, frustration knotting his brow. "Lilian, how can you think I'd be so reckless? Mr. Fitzgerald is sure he can help Grace. I practically moved heaven and earth to get him here from Solomia. Why won't you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian gave a bitter laugh, shaking her head. "It's not about not believing, Benjamin. Kingston's got the best medical care in the country, and they're still helpless. How can I just put my faith in some kid barely out of his teens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing nearby, Amelia felt the same way. She didn't believe Marcus had a snowball's chance in hell of curing leukemia, but she knew better than to voice it outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the ICU. We need quiet here. Keep it down, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenny Chase, a young female doctor, tall and composed with delicate features, approached them and reminded Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I got carried away," Benjamin said, forcing himself to calm down. "Dr. Chase, how's my daughter doing? Any change?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her condition is critical. We administered adrenaline, but she's only got two, maybe three hours left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenny looked genuinely saddened by the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even doctors couldn't help but feel a pang of pity for such a young life on the brink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Chase, I've got a miracle doctor here who can fix what ails my daughter. Can I bring him in for a look-see?" Benjamin asked with hope. He wasn't playing the mayor card for any favors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenny frowned, shaking her head. "The ICU is restricted. No unauthorized personnel. Besides, this hospital is the most authoritative blood disease center in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. Where did this 'miracle doctor' come from? Does he even have a medical license? I advise you not to trust these so-called quacks. You'll just end up losing money and maybe your daughter, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes flicked over Marcus, a hint of hostility flashing in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald doesn't have a license, but even Robert praised his skills," Benjamin argued. "I believe he can save my daughter. Please, Dr. Chase, just give him a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his daughter's last hope, and he wasn't backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's all the commotion out here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ICU door swung open, and a middle-aged male doctor, Hugh Williamson, stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Williamson, this gentleman is insisting on letting someone without a medical license treat the patient," Jenny said with frustration. "I can't talk him out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh addressed Benjamin. "I hear you're the mayor of Solomia, a high-ranking official. I admire you for not abusing your position to get special treatment for your daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're educated and experienced. Why are you falling for this charlatan </span><span>nonsense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling </span><span>you,</span><span> Mr. Fitzgerald is not a charlatan!" Benjamin shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way those two doctors kept throwing around "charlatan" at Marcus was starting to grind Benjamin's gears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one who'd brought Marcus here, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh scoffed, "Since Mayor Benjamin insists, I won't argue. It's your daughter. I'll let your 'doctor' in, but if anything goes wrong, don't blame the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian's face was tight with worry. She couldn't help but turn to Benjamin. "Benjamin, why are you getting more stubborn as you get older? You don't trust the doctors in Kingston, but you trust some kid in his twenties?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin didn't respond. Lilian knew that once he'd made up his mind, there was no changing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed, "Fine. Grace only has a few hours left anyway. Do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh shot Marcus a contemptuous look and opened the ICU door. "Mayor Benjamin, go right ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin gave Marcus a grateful smile, "Thank you for your help, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a nod, kept his lips sealed, and marched straight into the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the hospital bed, a young girl lay still, tubes snaking around her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl was young. Her delicate face, still carrying that childlike innocence, was ghostly pale, and her body was so frail that it seemed like she was clinging to life by a thread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, Dad's here," Benjamin murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing his daughter in such torment was more than Benjamin could bear. Tears streamed down his face as he dashed to her bedside and grasped her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus activated his X-ray vision, analyzing her condition down to the cellular level and formulating a plan with cold precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that the so-called miracle doctor?" Hugh muttered to Jenny. They hadn't left, choosing to observe from the doorway.</span></p><div class="pagination">
