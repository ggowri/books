  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was even a subtle allure in her presence, especially in her eyes, which seemed capable of captivating anyone who looked into them. They appeared pure but carried an undeniable seductive power, making it difficult to forget her after just one glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling himself back from his thoughts, Marcus replied calmly, "So, you're here to avenge your cousin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus didn't directly answer Silvia's question, his words implied he had indeed done what she accused him of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia immediately furrowed her brows. "My cousin said your strength is extraordinary, capable of easily slaying an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert. I'm curious to see it for myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Silvia's aura erupted, filling the air with an overwhelming pressure that immediately made the atmosphere feel suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Silvia took a step forward, her body moving with the fluid grace of a spirit, instantly closing the distance between herself and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of her delicate hand, she conjured swirling ribbons of azure energy. The energy swirled in her palm like liquid power, and with a swift motion, she launched a strike toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike seemed simple, but it instantly enveloped the area in front of Marcus, and the energy exuded a unique aura&mdash;soft and flowing like water, yet sharp and cutting like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before the Hand Strike reached him, Marcus felt an intense, almost painful sensation, as though his very flesh was being sliced apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm only using fifty percent of my strength," Silvia said as she struck, her tone cold. "I hope your abilities don't disappoint me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the blue light of the energy, her skin seemed even more flawless, and her whole presence radiated a celestial beauty. She truly resembled an ethereal being descending to the mortal realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her, Marcus couldn't help but feel a moment of admiration. There was something different about Silvia&mdash;her aura was unlike any other woman he had encountered before. It was mysterious and captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Silvia's Hand Strike approached, Marcus casually threw out a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current level, Marcus had reached Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Four, and with his Hidden State cultivation level, his power was on par with a Level Nine Demon Fighter. This gave him a distinct advantage&mdash;one whole State above Silvia's Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of power disparity, even if Marcus only used a small fraction of his strength, Silvia would be no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their energies clashed, the blue ribbons of energy attempted to wrap around Marcus' arm, but his punch, even with only ten percent of his strength, easily broke through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave from their collision was overwhelming, and Silvia's blue energy crumbled in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of Marcus's punch sent a powerful wave crashing into Silvia, causing her to stagger back, her breath hitching, and her complexion growing pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Challenging me? I suggest you go back and train some more before you try again," Marcus said, standing with his hands behind his back, smirking lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's perfect brow furrowed slightly, her face showing a hint of defiance. "I told you, I was only using fifty percent of my strength. If I went all out, it wouldn't be so easy to say who would win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the confidence the girl displayed. "In that case, how about a bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia, curious, asked, "What kind of bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned.
