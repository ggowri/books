  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The enemies kept moving swiftly, clearly trying to lure Marcus toward a specific spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>About twenty minutes later, the car had reached the outskirts of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The area was surrounded by rugged mountains, isolated, with barely a soul in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A narrow road led deep into the woods, casting an ominous, eerie vibe under the moonlit sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus spotted several figures near a cliff's edge. Their attire was strange, and their faces were marked with disturbing symbols.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air around them pulsed with a sickly crimson aura, sending a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus signaled the driver to pull over, then stepped out of the car and started walking toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the near-total darkness, their eyes glowed a menacing red, cutting through the night like ghosts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, didn't think you'd actually show up alone. You've got guts, I'll give you that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them spoke in a cold tone, his accent thick with Southvaian influence, though his Uswadic wasn't perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's behind this attack? Tell me!" Marcus' voice was ice-cold, a direct challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You crossed Mr. Roger Gellar. Now you'll pay for it. You must've known this would come," the figure sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't get it. You're willing to die just to serve him? What's he giving you that makes this worth it?" Marcus asked, his tone dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Curse Weavers laughed harshly, their amusement thick with mockery. "Heh, you really don't get it, do you? You're already as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're here to end you, kid. This is your final stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them sneered and began muttering dark words under his breath. A blood-red light flared to life around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his hand, a metal bell appeared, its eerie chime ringing through the air as he gave it a quick shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, countless blood-red insects materialized, buzzing through the air, swarming toward Marcus like a living nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each insect was about the size of a thumb, radiating a corrupt, rotting stench. Their sharp mandibles glistened with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus recognized them immediately&mdash;these were cursed insects, born of curses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A single bite would inject a deadly poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Screech..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The swarm of insects shrieked as they descended upon Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They came at him with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, another Curse Weaver made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A small pouch appeared in his hand. With a flick of his wrist, he released a cloud of pink powder into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The powder settled over Marcus' body in an instant, and the insects went wild with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frenzied, they closed in on Marcus, desperate to tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flame!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus snapped, his voice like a whip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flames exploded from his body as fire surged in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a single swipe, a torrent of fire erupted, engulfing the insects in a blaze of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The creatures screamed in agony as they were burned to a crisp, their bodies crumbling to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Curse Weavers' faces twisted in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't expect you to be this powerful. Looks like I misjudged you. But don't get too cocky&mdash;together, we'll take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they spoke, the Curse Weavers began chanting in unison, their palms glowing with dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying totem took shape in the air, a twisted and malevolent symbol, rapidly expanding toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus grinned coldly, stepping into his Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he vanished, leaving behind only a blur of afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He dodged the totem by this means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reappeared right in front of one of the Curse Weavers, and before the man could react, Marcus' fist rocketed toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blow landed with a sickening crack, and the Curse Weaver's shoulder shattered under the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man staggered back, howling in pain, but somehow, he managed to stay on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His lips curled into a grimace as he muttered another incantation, drawing on blood energy to heal his injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The broken bones visibly mended, the flesh knitting together in mere seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two other Curse Weavers unsheathed their scimitars, their blades gleaming with dark, blood-red light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They charged forward, their movements swift and deadly, slashing at Marcus with brutal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't back down. With a swift movement, he drew his own golden scimitar and clashed against their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud metallic crash rang through the night as his blade met theirs, sending their scimitars flying from their hands. The two Curse Weavers staggered backward, thrown off balance by the force of the impact.</span></p><div class="pagination">
