  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales didn't say anything, but Sheila said, "Honey, Baily had a good relationship with me when we were in school. We are old classmates. Can you help him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know Ms. Smith, so it would be easy to ask her to arrange for an ordinary employee to go in, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales said with difficulty, "How can it be that simple? I do have a good relationship with Ms. Smith, but it's not easy to do it with just a few words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Baily understood what Scales meant and said, "Scales, don't worry. I won't let you do it for nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales pretended to be generous and said, "You and Sheila are old classmates. There is no need to be so polite to me. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, I know, but I'm a grateful person. I know what I should do," Baily said with a flattering</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Baily was a government official, he had to be humble when he asked Scales for help. After all, Scales was rich. There was nothing wrong with having more connections. They could help each other in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening to the conversation, Marcus frowned. He hated people taking advantage of privilege and nepotism in his company. It would cause many things to lose fairness and justice and affect the company's interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, Scales said that he could easily arrange a position for someone in Golden Group by relying on his connections. In his view, the interview was dispensable at all. Such things were absolutely harmful to the long-term development of the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Marcus couldn't help but ask Baily, "May I ask what your girlfriend's education level is and what work experience she has?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily glanced at Marcus and answered without overthinking it, "He graduated from a junior college, and she is studying hard to upgrade her qualifications. She is young, so she has never worked. But it doesn't matter. With Scales' arrangement, she can easily join Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you are envious, you can ask Scales for help now. Scales is a good guy. As long as you beg him for help, he will definitely pity you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people looked at Marcus, thinking that he was tempted by what Scales said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Baily with a strange look and said, "The minimum educational requirement for Golden Group's staff recruitment is a master's degree. Your girlfriend graduated from a junior college, so even if she upgraded her qualifications, she would not be able to meet the recruitment standards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people froze when they heard this. Someone laughed, "It sounds like you know the recruitment standards of Golden Group. Do you really think you are the head of Golden Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, he has been putting on airs all the time. He is really overestimating himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily smiled, looked at the girl who worked as an accountant at Golden Group, and asked, "Katy, is what Marcus said true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Katy nodded and said, "That's true. I took the master's degree just to join Golden Group. Fortunately, the working treatment at Golden Group is pretty good, so my efforts over the years have not been in vain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, everyone couldn't help but look at Marcus seriously. They didn't expect that he had actually said the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily frowned, feeling a little uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales said, "Your girlfriend can't meet the educational requirements, but with me here, it's not difficult to help her join Golden Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Scales got familiar with everyone, he seemed to be less low-key than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily immediately smiled and nodded. "Yes, with you there, this matter will be no problem. I underestimated your ability just now. I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, Baily looked at Marcus and said, "Did you hear that? Rules are fixed, but people are not. With Scales' help, even if my girlfriend doesn't meet the educational requirements, she will definitely be able to join Golden Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the compliments, Sheila lost herself a little. She stood up and said, "If anyone wants to join Golden Group, just tell Scales. He will definitely help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales smiled, "In fact, this matter is indeed not easy, but I have had a good relationship with the HR manager of Golden Group recently. With his help, I can let as many people join Golden Group as I want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said excitedly, looking forward to joining Golden Group, "Sheila, your boyfriend is awesome, and you're really nice. Our jobs are counting on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine couldn't stand it anymore and whispered to Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, they are going too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave Catherine a reassuring look and said indifferently, "I reiterate it. Those who can't meet the academic qualifications can never join Golden Group."</span></p><div class="pagination">
