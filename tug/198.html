What a grand event!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett Villa was located on several acres of land north of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The building appeared luxurious, simple, magnificent, and impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the courtyard was carefully decorated, and there was a constant stream of guests coming and going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A magnificent banquet was set in the living room of the Burnett Villa, and people were bustling about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, wearing a suit and with snow-white hair, sat in the main seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being in his 80s, he had a strong breath, a ruddy complexion, and was full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him stood two pairs of middle-aged couples with extraordinary demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Maxine's parents, Owen Burnett and Hazel Burnett, and her uncle and his wife, Malcolm Burnett and Ruth Burnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's elder sister, Stella Burnett, came back from </span><span>Acoton</span><span> to celebrate Matthew's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far from Stella was a young man in a white suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was handsome, elegant, and noble. He was Malcolm's son, Arnold Burnett, and the only male heir in the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to these direct descendants of the Burnett family, members of the branches also arrived. There were dozens of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, acting like the head of the family, and Hazel were greeting the guests who came to celebrate Matthew's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm and Ruth stood by and watched coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Shaun preparing? We have waited so long for today. We must make sure everything goes well," Ruth asked Malcolm in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were fierce. "Don't worry. Shaun wants Maxine. I have agreed to marry her into the Whitman family after becoming the head of the family. Shaun will naturally help me unconditionally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good. When you become the head of the family, the Burnett family business will belong to us, and Arnold will inherit your position smoothly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being in her 50s, she was still charming and elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes betrayed her shrewdness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's ambition was half related to Ruth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had not been instigating behind the scenes, he would not have thought of replacing Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. In order to ensure that everything is perfect, in addition to Shaun, I have also invited experts from the Astral Serpent Order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, I have Mr. Roger Gellar's support for being the head of the Burnett family. This is truly destiny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm was proud. When he mentioned Roger, his reverence was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather is the most powerful man in the world. Mr. Roger Gellar will help us a lot! But, Malcolm, don't talk nonsense. If others hear it and tell Godfather, we will most likely be punished by him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth ignored the experts from the Astral Serpent Order and focused her attention entirely on Roger. She was nervous.</span></p><div class="pagination">
