  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, I'm not the type to back out," Jade said with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face showed resolve, though she couldn't help but feel a trace of doubt about Marcus' proposed plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with things reaching this point, she had no choice but to forge ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jayden, be my witness. If Jade goes back on her word, you have to fire her on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya directed her words to Jayden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden nodded with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze at Jade held a trace of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his mind, he thought, "Robert, you got me fired back then. Now it's time for your daughter to pay&mdash;an eye for an eye, a job for a job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus had finalized the surgical plan for Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He discreetly handed the plan to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's eyes sparkled with determination as she changed into her scrubs and headed straight into the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew everything was riding on this moment, and she had to give it her all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Jade walk into the OR, Marcus remained supremely confident, casually crossing his legs on the bench outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're friends with Jade, right?" Freya asked, approaching Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya stood in front of Marcus, arms crossed over her chest, emphasizing her exaggerated figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's up?" Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you realize it's your encouragement that's about to cost Jade her job?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya smirked, her expression full of scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How can you be so sure the surgery will fail? Can you predict the future?" Marcus retorted with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' face was filled with sarcasm as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya sneered, "You're an amateur, so I don't blame you for being clueless. With the patient's injuries, even the best doctors would be helpless. That's exactly why I opposed trying to restore his mobility in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's impossible to fix. Forget Jade&mdash;some of the top surgeons in Acoton would struggle with this level of complexity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So if Jade does end up quitting, the blame is on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Freya and grinned. "How about we make a bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya's interest was piqued. "What kind of bet?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the surgery succeeds, you quit your job. If it fails, I'll do whatever you say. Do you dare to bet?" Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya hesitated briefly but quickly agreed. "Since you're asking for it, I'll play along. Later, I'll have you on your knees barking like a dog! Ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya agreed so easily because she was convinced there was no way she could lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had walked straight into her trap, and she couldn't wait to humiliate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's wait and see," Marcus replied confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' expression remained calm and self-assured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leaned back on the bench, closing his eyes to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bet quickly caught the attention of others in the department, especially Jayden, who watched with great interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone connected to Robert was someone Jayden relished the chance to humiliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was eager to see how this clueless fool would kneel and bark like a dog in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time ticked by, and soon two hours had passed. There was still no movement from the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya's impatience was starting to show. "It's been two hours already. What's taking Jade so long? Could it be the surgery failed, and she's afraid to come out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden checked the time as well and said, "Two hours is a long time. She can't hide in there forever. Once she's out, I'll fire her on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're impatient after just two hours?" Marcus interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's working to restore the patient's ability to walk and run. It's a complicated surgery, and two hours isn't nearly enough. But if I had to guess, she'll be done in another 40 minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his words, Jayden and Freya exchanged a glance, the mockery in their eyes unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya sneered, "You talk like you actually know surgery. How ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But since you're so confident, I'll wait another 40 minutes. After that, Jade will be out of this hospital, and you'll be on your knees barking. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many others cast mocking looks at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't understand why he was so eager to humiliate himself over a surgery that seemed impossible to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did he actually enjoy making a fool of himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, another 40 minutes had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya and Jayden both stood up, and Freya said, "It's been 40 minutes. Jade still hasn't come out. She must be hiding from the fallout of her failure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since she's not coming out, it's time for you to honor the bet. Kneel and start barking!" Freya demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus ignored Freya entirely and began his own countdown.</span></p><div class="pagination">
